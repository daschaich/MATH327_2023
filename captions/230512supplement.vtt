1
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:15.740
David Schaich (he): All right, that should be a recording under way for another of these supplemental pencasts that are making up for some of the many hours of lecture we lost to bank holidays in this month.

2
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.330
David Schaich (he): So the

3
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:33.000
David Schaich (he): outlook for this supplement will be on some fun exact results for the Ising model in a low number of dimensions, which

4
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.980
David Schaich (he): will

5
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.300
David Schaich (he): pop up in the final lecture that we'll have on Monday morning.  We'll compare

6
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.040
David Schaich (he): these exact results to the predictions of the mean-field approximation that we've been developing in the lecture.

7
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.270
David Schaich (he): It's currently Friday, the twelfth

8
00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:04.629
David Schaich (he): of May, just before I get kicked out of the building while it's refurbished over the weekend, which means that the one last pencast I'm expecting to

9
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.920
David Schaich (he): wrap up, I will not be able to fit in until next week, probably on Monday, after

10
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.570
David Schaich (he): the lecture in the morning.

11
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.760
But the focus for

12
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:24.430
David Schaich (he): this one today is the exact solution of the Ising model in one dimension.

13
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.240
David Schaich (he): This is actually something that Ising himself

14
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.460
David Schaich (he): worked out almost a hundred years ago, while he was doing a PhD and working on 

15
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:49.730
David Schaich (he): the model that his PhD supervisor Lenz had developed, and which gained his name after

16
00:01:49.940 --> 00:02:01.620
David Schaich (he): he showed how to solve it in one dimension. where the key aspect of the easy model on a one-dimensional lattice that makes it possible to solve. Exactly

17
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.230
David Schaich (he): is that the number of links we've seen is d times and d dimensions that is just

18
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:18.750
David Schaich (he): equal to N in one dimension. So we have it exactly the same number of sites as we do links. and we can use that

19
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:35.020
David Schaich (he): to rewrite the interaction term and using model energy. Sj. Times S. A. Our nearest neighbor sites in terms of the sites themselves, rather than these pairs of nearest neighbors that correspond to links

20
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:49.230
David Schaich (he): and specifically you remember a picture of a one-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions. We have some sites and periodic gallery conditions.

21
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.670
David Schaich (he): Oh. cause this sites to wrap around themselves.

22
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.470
David Schaich (he): We just end up with nearest neighbor interactions

23
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.890
David Schaich (he): on those peers of links just being a sum.

24
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.050
David Schaich (he): Okay.

25
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.870
David Schaich (he): 1 2 3, all the way up to, and

26
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.160
David Schaich (he): it's been on the site and times the spin on site and for small I'm. Just coming around

27
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.320
in pairs

28
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.680
David Schaich (he): and using periodic boundary conditions to

29
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.260
David Schaich (he): route, so n minus one around it, identify it with

30
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.750
David Schaich (he): site more

31
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.840
David Schaich (he): so to be a bit more explicit, the

32
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.690
David Schaich (he): full energy of the using model. In this case we'll have

33
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.820
David Schaich (he): the usual 2 terms. We can now write, both as a single sum over the sites

34
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.310
David Schaich (he): that interaction. And then for the

35
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.980
David Schaich (he): magnetic field up.

36
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:08.300
David Schaich (he): When people go online aside, taken up front, I will. We write this in a slightly more symmetric way. So instead of just having h times s. I will include both

37
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:17.959
David Schaich (he): S. Of N. And S. Of n plus one which will make some of the subsequent calculations more symmetric, more elegant, and a bit easier to

38
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.370
David Schaich (he): 30 out. So

39
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.080
David Schaich (he): I will add 2

40
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:36.190
David Schaich (he): terms coupled to that external magnetic field. H. They are identical, and the sum over all the sites. So I just have to divide them by 2 to get back to the usual starting point.

41
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:49.240
David Schaich (he): and then the partition function that we have based on this energy is, as always, the sum over swim configurations to the line of speed up

42
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:58.640
David Schaich (he): times the energy which we can write as a sum over all possible values of the end spins

43
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:09.000
David Schaich (he): s one s 2 all the way up to sn being either plus or minus one. So there are 2 to the n terms in all of those sums.

44
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.950
David Schaich (he): and then we have the exponential of a single stop.

45
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:25.700
David Schaich (he): which, as usual, we can convert to a product of exponentials, and from one up to capital ends with a number of sites which is just data lines.

46
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.980
David Schaich (he): This expression for the energy you have to.

47
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.950
David Schaich (he): You may have the signs cancel out.

48
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.470
David Schaich (he): you know.

49
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.900
David Schaich (he): and plus speed of time stage over to

50
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.920
this one.

51
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.200
David Schaich (he): and what we would really like to do is factorize

52
00:05:51.470 --> 00:06:03.840
David Schaich (he): all of these sums just like we were able to do for a non interacting period. That's what makes non interacting systems so much simpler and more solvable compared to interrupting systems.

53
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.570
David Schaich (he): and we can almost do so.

54
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.580
David Schaich (he): the only complication being that from the interaction term.

55
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.480
David Schaich (he): We have

56
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.200
David Schaich (he): factors of S and S. N. Plus one

57
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:32.250
David Schaich (he): that both up here and and i'll be split up into separate independent.

58
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.630
David Schaich (he): So the instruction is that if we were to distribute these

59
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.280
David Schaich (he): terms across all of those 2 to the end

60
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:50.280
David Schaich (he): summations. you would have to somehow make sure that there is a consistency between

61
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.860
David Schaich (he): the values of the spins. So you, an arbitrary spin. Sj.

62
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.490
David Schaich (he): Has to be the same when it corresponds

63
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.920
David Schaich (he): to sn when N. Equals J.

64
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:18.860
David Schaich (he): Or when it corresponds to sn plus one, so n plus one equals J. This is the same spin. So for a fixed configuration it has to have the same value. It is itself.

65
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.580
David Schaich (he): and a trick that we can carry out to

66
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:31.140
David Schaich (he): guarantee that only consistent values of the spins

67
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.230
David Schaich (he): up here. We try to factorize this. Some into a simple product

68
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.410
David Schaich (he): is to

69
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.950
David Schaich (he): organize all of those as

70
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.240
David Schaich (he): a form of 2 by 2 matrix multiplication.

71
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.260
David Schaich (he): We're.

72
00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:00.630
David Schaich (he): We identified the different elements of this 2 by 2 matrix.

73
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.710
David Schaich (he): with the different possibilities for the combinations of plus one or minus one spins

74
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.490
David Schaich (he): at sites and and n plus one

75
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.760
David Schaich (he): so

76
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:22.600
David Schaich (he): graphic, or visually. We have 4 possibilities for the 2 values that each of these 2 spins can take.

77
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.800
David Schaich (he): You write that in a 2 by 2 matrix where the upper left corner

78
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.480
David Schaich (he): go through the spin, or plus one

79
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.740
David Schaich (he): lower left, you have minus one plus one.

80
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.000
David Schaich (he): and then

81
00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.500
David Schaich (he): just generalize to the upper

82
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:47.280
David Schaich (he): and we're right. And if we then right. this exponential factor

83
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:53.530
David Schaich (he): as he made risk and for site Admin.

84
00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:06.130
David Schaich (he): Okay. in the upper left elements of this matrix we have both S and and S n plus one are one. So we pick up

85
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.050
David Schaich (he): and e to the beta. and from the

86
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.780
David Schaich (he): term involving the magnetic field, we have one plus one is 2 that cancels the 2. We have this, another E to the

87
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.830
David Schaich (he): data H.

88
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:26.410
David Schaich (he): When S. And S. One had opposite signs minus one plus one or plus one minus one.

89
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:37.030
David Schaich (he): that some cancel out. That product will be minus one. So the off I elements of this matrix tn we get e to the minus beta.

90
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.080
David Schaich (he): and then back in the lower right

91
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:48.020
David Schaich (he): we have. I get a plus one from minus one squared. and now in overall minus 2 in here.

92
00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:55.680
David Schaich (he): That gives an overall negative sign on that magnetic field. please.

93
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.910
David Schaich (he): and it

94
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.180
David Schaich (he): to illustrate why

95
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:07.050
David Schaich (he): this strict of organizing as matrix multiplication helps. If we consider

96
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.070
David Schaich (he): the interest product

97
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:14.530
David Schaich (he): that's

98
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:24.990
David Schaich (he): would appear as we take this product over all of the insights. So we will have terms like this matrix TV and multiplied.

99
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.760
David Schaich (he): Oh, I am the next increment in plus one.

100
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.970
David Schaich (he): Then, in the diagonal elements

101
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:45.440
David Schaich (he): of that matrix product you will have multiplications of those 2 matrices. where

102
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:53.460
David Schaich (he): the value of the second spin and plus one has to match up to the value of the first spin, and

103
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.480
David Schaich (he): in the second

104
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.330
David Schaich (he): matrix. The second copy of this Tn.

105
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.860
David Schaich (he): So all of the

106
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:08.900
David Schaich (he): download spin configurations just call them configs

107
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.910
David Schaich (he): with self consistent values out of it.

108
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:24.260
David Schaich (he): That n plus one spin will be added together in the diagonal elements of the product of this matrix, which we can then

109
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:28.110
David Schaich (he): generalize to that full set of

110
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:33.150
David Schaich (he): in products over capital. N. Now, matrices.

111
00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:42.340
David Schaich (he): the full partition function is going to be given by the product over in factors of t sub n.

112
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:50.640
David Schaich (he): and by taking the trace we pull out the sum of those diagonal elements that hold all of the valid spin configurations

113
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.970
David Schaich (he): and discard all the ones where

114
00:11:54.700 --> 00:12:03.740
David Schaich (he): certain terms we're computed. Assuming that sn plus one or one. and at the same time

115
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.210
David Schaich (he): assuming that it was minus one, and looking at the interaction from the next link over.

116
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:24.610
David Schaich (he): So this trace of a product accounts for all of these spin configurations that actually make sense. They satisfy the constraints, and by the interaction that we have to deal with now.

117
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:37.350
David Schaich (he): And what's more, because there is no dependence on N in this 2 by 2 matrix team. We can just write it as and factors all the way

118
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:48.040
David Schaich (he): some matrix t with no need any longer to label it with an index that doesn't actually change anything in the matrix.

119
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:50.920
David Schaich (he): So.

120
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.440
David Schaich (he): you know, be able to squeeze in.

121
00:12:55.530 --> 00:13:07.330
David Schaich (he): The What do you feel way of writing this trace in products of T. If we have. E. I. J. Labeling the

122
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.020
David Schaich (he): the elements of one copy of this matrix

123
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:16.360
David Schaich (he): that gets multiplied by a. T. J.

124
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:21.690
David Schaich (he): Where the jays are all summed over.

125
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:28.890
David Schaich (he): The K. Is similarly all summed over. and so on until we get

126
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:38.640
David Schaich (he): all the way to the end value of this team. and we sum over the eyes at the beginning and end to implement the periodic boundary conditions

127
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.590
David Schaich (he): that round all of these

128
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.010
David Schaich (he): matrices back around to the starting point.

129
00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.420
David Schaich (he): So something over J. K. L. Hi, and

130
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.760
David Schaich (he): and all the indices in there.

131
00:13:53.690 --> 00:14:03.470
David Schaich (he): That is the whole messy way of writing this trace. I mentioned before going further, that this T. You

132
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:20.880
David Schaich (he): is generally referred to as a transfer matrix. The idea of being that we have organized things in such a way that information about the value of each spin is being transferred from one link to the next to make sure that

133
00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.570
David Schaich (he): each of those links is treated consistent.

134
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.900
David Schaich (he): So we have been able to.

135
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:35.500
David Schaich (he): We write the expression for the partition function of the one, the using model

136
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.350
David Schaich (he): as something very short.

137
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:43.820
David Schaich (he): But we've done that essentially by wrapping all of the complexity inside

138
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:50.700
David Schaich (he): this transfer matrix that gets so we still don't have any better grip on them.

139
00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:57.180
David Schaich (he): A closed-form expression for what this trace of a product actually is

140
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.940
David Schaich (he): what this does give us is a bit of guidance about

141
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.810
David Schaich (he): what we would really like to see

142
00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.860
David Schaich (he): for this. If If

143
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.300
David Schaich (he): this transfer matrix team. we

144
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.470
David Schaich (he): a diagonal matrix. we have it. See one eigenvalue

145
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.960
David Schaich (he): lambda plus up in the upper left corner, zeros off the

146
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.960
David Schaich (he): a second eigenvalue link to minus in the right corner.

147
00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:41.640
David Schaich (he): Well, then, you wouldn't make some more progress on the partition function.

148
00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:52.980
David Schaich (he): N powers of the diagonal matrix. It's just the diagonal matrix of those eigenvalues raised to the nth power. Hello. the

149
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.980
David Schaich (he): diagonal! So we would have the trace just to the end.

150
00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:06.200
David Schaich (he): lambda minus the end. which is just in the some I' the plus to the end, and I have to minus to the end.

151
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:13.600
David Schaich (he): So what this suggests we should do is just diagonalize

152
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.880
David Schaich (he): to transform it for this, etc., which is a 2 by 2 matrix.

153
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:30.490
David Schaich (he): And we can hope that the structure of the easy model energy allows us to diagonalize this matrix in a

154
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.440
David Schaich (he): well-defined way without too much difficulty, and something.

155
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:47.250
David Schaich (he): I'm sure you've seen that in previous modules that we've been up for a few years is how exactly matrices get back to the wise. We need to

156
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:54.310
David Schaich (he): solve the characteristic equation I this matrix which is just

157
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.570
David Schaich (he): taking

158
00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:01.330
David Schaich (he): the matrix T. This set of exponentials

159
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:10.680
David Schaich (he): subtracting the identity matrix with some coefficients or or lambda.

160
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:17.510
David Schaich (he): that determinant gets set to 0 to define the characteristic equation and find its roots

161
00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:22.750
David Schaich (he): and the details of your point in it that we have

162
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.349
David Schaich (he): to the beaters minus betas

163
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:36.730
David Schaich (he): and plus minus Beta H. We subtract from the diagonal elements I am doing.

164
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:46.090
David Schaich (he): and then organize the characteristic polynomial in terms of powers of this lambda. So a lambda squared.

165
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:52.480
David Schaich (he): observed from. We have factors of minus lambda times.

166
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:55.800
David Schaich (he): He's either the beta, he to the Beta h's

167
00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:04.290
David Schaich (he): one diagonal so we can pull out an overall lambda e to the plus beta in this first term. We then have you to the

168
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.610
David Schaich (he): plus beta h the second cross term

169
00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.680
David Schaich (he): with the same sign you to the minus. Get H.

170
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:17.030
David Schaich (he): Finally, the other terms down diagonal

171
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:22.090
David Schaich (he): have either the plus and minus beta, each canceling out any product. We just get

172
00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.680
David Schaich (he): E to the 2 beta. and then subtracting the off diagonal

173
00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.060
David Schaich (he): products, gives us E to the minus

174
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:37.100
David Schaich (he): to Beta at the end. which we can reorganize, using

175
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:49.640
David Schaich (he): familiar trigonometric identities. Lambda Square, minus 2 lambda into the beta that's a hyperbolic postline. I'll be the age

176
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.550
David Schaich (he): and then added to that

177
00:18:52.940 --> 00:19:01.980
David Schaich (he): twice the hyperbolic sign to Beta. and we want that 2 equals 0. Well.

178
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.950
David Schaich (he): as usual. Or if I can rise to 2 by 2

179
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.100
David Schaich (he): quadratic expression in

180
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:16.400
David Schaich (he): this parameter Lambda that will give us 2 roots which will be able to fl some name to minus.

181
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.140
David Schaich (he): and those 2 routes from the

182
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.200
David Schaich (he): quadratic equation

183
00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:27.000
David Schaich (he): switching to a new sheet. They will be a little of it.

184
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:50.660
David Schaich (he): I have to plus minus. Have a Google factor of one over 2 a. So i'm remembering the quadratic equation. A x squared plus b x plus c

185
00:19:50.700 --> 00:20:01.060
David Schaich (he): equals 0. The roots are one over 2 a. In this case a is one, so it's just a half. We have that minus B

186
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.430
which cancels out the my assign there.

187
00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:08.590
David Schaich (he): and gives us 2 you to the Beta. I'm just a cosh

188
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.490
David Schaich (he): of being an H, and then

189
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.030
David Schaich (he): plus, or minus the discriminant square root of B squared

190
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.500
David Schaich (he): so 4 into the 2 beta.

191
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:35.300
David Schaich (he): minus 4 times a C a is one, C is 2. I'm the cinch. so that 2 times 4 gives 8 factors

192
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.240
David Schaich (he): to bet on.

193
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.460
David Schaich (he): and we just need to simplify this a bit to It's something more

194
00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.290
David Schaich (he): hand. These who work with you can very easily cancel out

195
00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:57.720
David Schaich (he): factors of 2 from all of those terms to just say it was left on the cinch in the square root.

196
00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:03.380
David Schaich (he): and you can also pull out the ski to the beta.

197
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.780
David Schaich (he): the of the remaining terms

198
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:17.410
David Schaich (he): overall factor out phones. one plus or minus square rooms as long as we pulled out.

199
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:25.920
David Schaich (he): minus twice that cinch divided by it. each of the 2 beta

200
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.430
David Schaich (he): hush squared.

201
00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:31.080
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

202
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.480
David Schaich (he): So this is a

203
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:50.640
David Schaich (he): mildly complicated expression, as promised. The application of the overall partition function has

204
00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:58.410
David Schaich (he): did shift it into the transfer matrix, and now shift it into its eigenvalues that have this form. It's worth

205
00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:04.730
David Schaich (he): doing. Some sadly checks that these eigenvalues make sense.

206
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:17.340
David Schaich (he): So it's something that I invite you to do. But I won't do now in the interest of time, is actually just to pop these

207
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.610
David Schaich (he): 2 lambda plus minus

208
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:26.780
David Schaich (he): 4, a physical situation where the temperature and its inverse are always positive.

209
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:32.130
David Schaich (he): and we have defined that external magnetic field, always to be

210
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.820
David Schaich (he): not negative.

211
00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:42.890
David Schaich (he): also include a beta equals 0 infinite temperature in there. In all those cases they could check that

212
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.660
David Schaich (he): real numbers that discriminates, remains positive, and we get.

213
00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:57.900
David Schaich (he): we don't have square root of negative numbers, or anything nasty like that. and one over

214
00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:05.150
David Schaich (he): lambda plus is always greater than name to minus. That discriminant does not answer that

215
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:19.660
David Schaich (he): we can also check limits where things simplify. So, as Beta goes to 0. See? High temperature limits The larger eigenvalue of the plus

216
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.010
David Schaich (he): we go to E to the 0 is one.

217
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.000
It sounds.

218
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:35.900
David Schaich (he): We've signed hyperbolic to a sign of 0. It's also one. We have a one plus a square root of one minus 2 times the cinch

219
00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.870
David Schaich (he): of 0 and 0

220
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:45.870
David Schaich (he): like it's divided by one. Some of this remains modifying. We don't have any 0 over 0. If she was hiding in there.

221
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.200
David Schaich (he): What we do have is just one times

222
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:54.210
David Schaich (he): one plus the square root of one which is no to his friends. He has 2.

223
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.830
David Schaich (he): I am doing. This is

224
00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.840
David Schaich (he): the same, just with a negative sign

225
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.150
in the

226
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.660
David Schaich (he): so the one minus one that uses out to 0,

227
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:20.830
David Schaich (he): and as promised. nice real numbers with lambda plus greater than we can also consider what happens if we turn off the external magnetic field. In this case.

228
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.490
David Schaich (he): Lambda plus. we have to see either the beta factor

229
00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:29.040
David Schaich (he): out front. You call it. Cosine of 0 is one.

230
00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.390
David Schaich (he): Then we would have one plus

231
00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:45.540
David Schaich (he): square root of one minus twice the cinch right as e to the 2 beta minus E to the minus 2 beta

232
00:24:46.700 --> 00:25:01.380
David Schaich (he): and the denominator. There is just an even 2 data times One I sign again. so what that one that cancels out with either the 2 data divided by itself.

233
00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:06.920
David Schaich (he): All that is left is 2 negative signs give you a plus

234
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:11.640
David Schaich (he): 2 factors of E to the minus 2 Beta and the minus 4 beta.

235
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:22.030
David Schaich (he): So we have you to the Beta. I'm 20 plus one minus 4 beta. which is known to its friends as

236
00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:27.240
David Schaich (he): E to the minus 2, plus one is the minus beta, or

237
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.660
David Schaich (he): twice hyperbolic.

238
00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:32.390
Come aside the beta

239
00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:44.940
David Schaich (he): for them to plus to the again. Now to minus has the same cancellations. The only differences a negative sign in front of the square root

240
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.180
David Schaich (he): E to the minus beta

241
00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.600
David Schaich (he): is

242
00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.360
David Schaich (he): so

243
00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.120
David Schaich (he): in all those simpler limits we're getting

244
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.770
David Schaich (he): nice, elegant, and sensible

245
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.080
David Schaich (he): results

246
00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:10.620
David Schaich (he): if we plug those back into our partition function. So

247
00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:13.090
David Schaich (he): we have

248
00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.340
David Schaich (he): that the partition function was

249
00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:22.670
David Schaich (he): then the plus to the nth power to the empower

250
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:25.110
David Schaich (he): and with.

251
00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:34.030
David Schaich (he): and the plus always greater than lambda minus. We're not the words that ratio, lambda minus overlay to plus 3 less than one.

252
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.180
David Schaich (he): and there's always a very large number of degrees of freedom.

253
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.240
David Schaich (he): and they statistical sit down. We can

254
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:53.670
David Schaich (he): see that. In fact, it hasn't been, as N. Goes to infinity in that thermodynamic limit we have an exact

255
00:26:56.710 --> 00:27:08.280
David Schaich (he): result. That's the partition function just goes to Lambda plus to be at the power we're in that limit partition function

256
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.920
Amanda plus

257
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.810
David Schaich (he): the full expression of

258
00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.030
David Schaich (he): general non-negative beta, and

259
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.250
that we have and

260
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:21.660
David Schaich (he): hours

261
00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:31.680
David Schaich (he): and then in factors. Okay. this one minus one plus square root

262
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.370
David Schaich (he): expression.

263
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.800
David Schaich (he): So

264
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:52.570
David Schaich (he): there it is the exact solution for what dimensional using model like this form

265
00:27:52.860 --> 00:28:04.700
David Schaich (he): algebraic expression for its partition function from which we can provide it any observables of interest. as the you would strike us. so

266
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.080
David Schaich (he): one that will be

267
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:16.300
David Schaich (he): interesting and a bit easier to make sense of. Van is slightly messy expression than the

268
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:22.670
David Schaich (he): functions recently has. Power is the

269
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:26.530
David Schaich (he): the limit where that external magnetic field is turned off.

270
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:33.490
David Schaich (he): This is a quarter parameter for and the order of disorder, phase, transition

271
00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:44.010
David Schaich (he): of the using model between the high temperature, disorder, phase. the vanishing manifestation and the low temperature order phase that we use to look in the everything

272
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.160
David Schaich (he): a non 0 expectation value for the

273
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.420
David Schaich (he): the call. We derived

274
00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:56.110
David Schaich (he): the relation between

275
00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:03.640
David Schaich (he): the free energy, the log of the partition function and the expectation value of the

276
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:06.160
David Schaich (he): So after taking that derivative

277
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:09.400
David Schaich (he): to turn off the field, say H to 0,

278
00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:21.980
David Schaich (he): and just based on the expression we have here that the partition function is empowered to play the plus we'll we'll bring down, and one over n

279
00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:28.670
David Schaich (he): you will have the derivative of the which is just one over lambda plus

280
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.920
David Schaich (he): times derivative of

281
00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:31.890
plus

282
00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.060
David Schaich (he): and so

283
00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:37.330
David Schaich (he): and as always, with H set to 0 at the end.

284
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:42.070
David Schaich (he): So okay, we just need to compute

285
00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:46.200
David Schaich (he): the derivative with respect to beach. How do you

286
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.580
David Schaich (he): this expression? Without the ends

287
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:55.180
David Schaich (he): in particular? We each in there.

288
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.610
David Schaich (he): you don't send it to 0 yet

289
00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.690
David Schaich (he): the of all to assign Beta H.

290
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.270
David Schaich (he): Going ahead and redistributing it at

291
00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:12.520
David Schaich (he): Hush back or through, just because it'll be a bit easier to consider a derivative If I don't have

292
00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:14.470
David Schaich (he): square roots of one over

293
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.650
David Schaich (he): options off square to get age.

294
00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:33.410
David Schaich (he): so multiplying through gives us. i'll be you yeah the to be. I's square bit age no, not being in the denominator.

295
00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:36.620
David Schaich (he): and then each independence

296
00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:49.740
David Schaich (he): factory. my citizenship to data that will still be hanging around when we take the derivative of that expression. We'll get a one over square root of that whole mess.

297
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:53.150
David Schaich (he): Then, with the chain rule and the numerator, we will have

298
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.290
David Schaich (he): a 2 Cosh beta H. Cinch beta age.

299
00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:00.740
David Schaich (he): The first term is much simpler. That's to just cinch page.

300
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:07.580
David Schaich (he): So what we can see actually without grinding through all of the coefficients, and so on.

301
00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:11.540
David Schaich (he): is that both of the terms we get from this derivative

302
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.560
David Schaich (he): a proportional to

303
00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:22.900
David Schaich (he): you have to sign a beta H. And when we equals 0

304
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.920
David Schaich (he): we get a derivative that is proportional to 0,

305
00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.660
David Schaich (he): which is the saying, it is 0.

306
00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:36.710
David Schaich (he): So we are done. You get found and equals 0

307
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:43.450
David Schaich (he): for the one dimensional using model. You know, external field, and in particular.

308
00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:52.250
David Schaich (he): the expectation value of the magnetization is 0 for all temperatures limit of absolute 0 temperature.

309
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.300
David Schaich (he): What this means

310
00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:04.480
David Schaich (he): is that we are in the disorder phase with a vanishing magnetization for all temperatures.

311
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:08.680
David Schaich (he): and there is

312
00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:21.880
David Schaich (he): no phase transition at all with an easy model in one dimension. We can compare this on Monday to the prediction of the mean field approximation.

313
00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:29.240
David Schaich (he): and see how well it reproduces this very simple, exact result for the magnetization.

314
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:42.510
David Schaich (he): of course, back about weeks ago. Now, given the sparse of the lectures we've been having

315
00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:48.540
David Schaich (he): when we consider d greater than one. So 2 dimensions, 3 dimensions, or a higher number of dimensions.

316
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:54.080
David Schaich (he): Just by considering the high and low temperature limits of the system.

317
00:32:54.270 --> 00:33:01.080
David Schaich (he): we were able to see that there was a longer phase at sufficiently low temperatures. and

318
00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.990
David Schaich (he): with the mean field approximation, you saw that there was a these transition between them.

319
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.800
David Schaich (he): So it is worth

320
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:19.820
David Schaich (he): thinking physically. In addition to this mathematical derivation about what has happened in one dimensions to

321
00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:27.900
David Schaich (he): change the story and give us a system that is always disordered with no ordered phase.

322
00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.100
David Schaich (he): even if absolute your temperature

323
00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:32.360
David Schaich (he): so

324
00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:38.390
David Schaich (he): ask the physical question of Why is one dimension different.

325
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.510
David Schaich (he): then all of the higher dimensional.

326
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:43.390
David Schaich (he): using models where that

327
00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:49.340
David Schaich (he): lower temperature regime is characterized by the emergence of order.

328
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.340
David Schaich (he): But when we're going through that low temperature limits.

329
00:33:53.660 --> 00:34:08.260
David Schaich (he): if I recall where you can pause this recording and look back at your notes that we compared to the ground stage with the maximum value of the magnetization. If the first excitement state had a slightly smaller magnetization.

330
00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:20.909
David Schaich (he): it's like the higher temperature, so on the one hand. less probability from its Boltzmann factor exponentially less probability. Now, the other hand, a higher degeneracy.

331
00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:26.820
David Schaich (he): So for you repeat that consideration

332
00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.010
David Schaich (he): in the one dimensional case

333
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.070
David Schaich (he): I want to revisit

334
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:42.850
David Schaich (he): the balance of that lower probability

335
00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:53.130
David Schaich (he): i'll be yeah exponentially suppressed. Bolton Factor times the higher degeneracy that we have from the larger number of

336
00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.640
David Schaich (he): microstates with the

337
00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.390
David Schaich (he): energy of that first excited state.

338
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:04.910
David Schaich (he): So

339
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.510
David Schaich (he): the first excited state for the general

340
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:15.900
David Schaich (he): using models that we were considering. We're coming from a single spin.

341
00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:25.440
David Schaich (he): which we certainly can do when the is it to one for you

342
00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:35.600
David Schaich (he): roll a picture of a one-dimensional using model, just a chain of spins can you buy links wrapping around. And so

343
00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.130
David Schaich (he): through the usual periodic boundary conditions.

344
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:44.010
I totally

345
00:35:46.320 --> 00:36:01.400
David Schaich (he): the ground State has all the spins on each of those sites aligned. and in the first excited states we flipped one of those spins that one is now aligned against all the others.

346
00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:16.500
David Schaich (he): and that raised the energy of the system coming from the plus one contributions. It's 2 links that connected to his 2 nearest neighbors. And now I have opposing songs.

347
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:27.640
David Schaich (he): What is unique in the one-dimensional case is what happens if the

348
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:37.000
David Schaich (he): also flip the next kind of one. then the link between these 2 nearest neighbors use

349
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.180
negative contribution again.

350
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:49.140
David Schaich (he): and that positive contribution reducing the probability the factor is shifted the next link over. So

351
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:57.930
David Schaich (he): in the excited States. Do not have that only looking at a single spin. but also to be a nearest neighbor.

352
00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.590
David Schaich (he): You may already

353
00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:11.380
David Schaich (he): that we can keep going further. Flip a third spin in a row.

354
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:16.840
David Schaich (he): a negative contribution. probably a link that is now

355
00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:21.800
David Schaich (he): in between these 2 click Spins positive contribution just shifts over.

356
00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.120
David Schaich (he): and it is

357
00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:27.180
David Schaich (he): same story. If we with 3 4 5, or

358
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.370
David Schaich (he): any number of students

359
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:31.530
David Schaich (he): you need a row

360
00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.140
David Schaich (he): it will always be the same

361
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:41.350
David Schaich (he): shift from the minimum energy of the ground state

362
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:48.570
David Schaich (he): to get us to that first excited state. Now, for all of these configurations, which is not the case in any higher number of dimensions.

363
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:55.500
David Schaich (he): where there would be additional neighbors for each of these spins that would be kicking up the energy with everyone that was flipped.

364
00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:04.230
David Schaich (he): But even though the energy is the same as we flip these 1 2 3 4 5 spins.

365
00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:20.160
David Schaich (he): Magnetization is steadily changing, so we don't have the fixed value of mechanization that we had the higher dimensional case just minus one

366
00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:24.330
David Schaich (he): plus 2 over n or plus one minus 2 over N.

367
00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:29.530
David Schaich (he): Depending on whether the single spend image like up or down

368
00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.480
David Schaich (he): bye.

369
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:42.300
David Schaich (he): Every possible magnetization in between there, including the maximization of 0, is coming in with the same

370
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:50.320
David Schaich (he): probability from the Boltzmann factor due to the fixed energy of all of these different configurations.

371
00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:53.030
David Schaich (he): And this is the

372
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:56.320
David Schaich (he): physical picture that

373
00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:02.390
David Schaich (he): alliance with the mathematical calculation we've already done to find the vanishing magnetization.

374
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.420
David Schaich (he): the sum over all the organizations with

375
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:12.710
David Schaich (he): special degeneracy and probability. In specifically, one dimensional case

376
00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:25.140
David Schaich (he): is how we can physically justify the expectation value of the organization, ending up always 0 for all temperatures. So it's this: the system

377
00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:30.800
David Schaich (he): is always in its disordered phase.

378
00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:42.720
David Schaich (he): I'm looking at the clock, and I think i'll spare you the the story about using.

379
00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:48.600
David Schaich (he): finding this results and deciding that the model that his advisor wants to come up with was

380
00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:56.210
David Schaich (he): inappropriate to describe Nature with their work based transitions and essentially setting it aside.

381
00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:02.970
David Schaich (he): I'm not thinking about it anymore until 40 years later people told him that he had become famous

382
00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:06.760
David Schaich (he): for his work on it, that he not been keeping track of

383
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:10.390
David Schaich (he): It's a fun story that he's just

384
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:14.080
David Schaich (he): not. We're extending the length of this

385
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.450
David Schaich (he): Pencast anymore. It's already getting a bit long.

386
00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:26.820
David Schaich (he): There are 2 more things I will say, though, before wrapping it up. One is that

387
00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:35.220
David Schaich (he): there is a useful way of analyzing this sort of situation which is generic to one dimension.

388
00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:46.440
David Schaich (he): If we have interacting systems more general than the using model in one dimensions. They typically will also always be disorder and show no ordered phase.

389
00:40:47.930 --> 00:41:00.520
David Schaich (he): And to look at those situations we can analyze the behavior of the system. not in terms of the spins themselves. but in terms of

390
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:11.710
David Schaich (he): the boundaries that are showing up as these red line. These written options on the links between where the spins are pointing in one direction versus pointing in another.

391
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:19.720
David Schaich (he): It's useful to analyze these sorts of systems in terms of those

392
00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:26.450
David Schaich (he): domains of spins quite in the same direction that are separated by what are called domain walls.

393
00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:36.470
David Schaich (he): So these walls

394
00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.950
David Schaich (he): separate the

395
00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:45.860
David Schaich (he): regions or domains. I'll be upward and downward, pointing spins.

396
00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.920
David Schaich (he): And because

397
00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:52.830
David Schaich (he): if we flip a spin

398
00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.250
David Schaich (he): on either side of the wall, we do not change the energy we want through that

399
00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.790
David Schaich (he): argument in some detail.

400
00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:07.940
David Schaich (he): These walls are able to move freely around the one dimensional system

401
00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.480
David Schaich (he): without changing the energy.

402
00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:20.580
David Schaich (he): but at the same time, as they move.

403
00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:28.040
David Schaich (he): they do correspond to different numbers of spins pointing in each direction.

404
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:34.100
David Schaich (he): So, without changing the energy, keeping the pulse on active the same.

405
00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:38.570
David Schaich (he): they do change

406
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.700
David Schaich (he): the magnetization

407
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:58.110
David Schaich (he): provide a way of analyzing these sorts of statistical systems just in terms of 2 really moving objects. These the main rules, rather than a very large number of

408
00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:13.660
David Schaich (he): elementary spins. and that can be an easier way to get at the simpler behavior of the absence of a for this transition. So that is one. Finally. the other is actually to

409
00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.570
David Schaich (he): step up to

410
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.670
David Schaich (he): the 2 dimensional.

411
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:19.980
David Schaich (he): easy model.

412
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:22.760
David Schaich (he): We have done it

413
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:30.080
David Schaich (he): the vanishing external feel where

414
00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:39.570
David Schaich (he): there is yeah remarkable results well, several remarkable results, one of them being

415
00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:44.570
David Schaich (he): the exact solution of the 0 field, 2 to the using model on the square lattice.

416
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:50.240
David Schaich (he): But there is in this case also a relation known

417
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:53.000
David Schaich (he): It's

418
00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.340
David Schaich (he): duality.

419
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:58.810
David Schaich (he): which was discovered by

420
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.570
David Schaich (he): Hans Kramer's, Gh. 28,

421
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:06.870
David Schaich (he): just a few years before. was able to

422
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:12.940
David Schaich (he): i'm up with an extremely complicated exact solution of the two-dimensional model.

423
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:20.750
David Schaich (he): Even Kramer's wanting the duality is complicated enough. That i'm not going to go through it in this

424
00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:24.210
David Schaich (he): lecture knows. If you want to read through it, you're welcome to

425
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:26.010
David Schaich (he): discuss it with me.

426
00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:30.750
David Schaich (he): I'll just basically write it down here and put it to use.

427
00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:32.440
David Schaich (he): What we have

428
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:38.060
David Schaich (he): is a relation between

429
00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.790
David Schaich (he): 2 different easy model partition functions.

430
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:46.590
David Schaich (he): In this 2D 0 field set.

431
00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:05.740
David Schaich (he): Specifically, we have

432
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:12.650
David Schaich (he): 1, 2D using model at some inverse temperature data addition functions that a beta.

433
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:15.310
David Schaich (he): this is related to

434
00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.640
David Schaich (he): the equal sign of it. Lower down We' into a the same

435
00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:34.710
David Schaich (he): models, partition functions. So to the using model. got a different inverse temperature. Where there are temperature depending factors

436
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:44.660
David Schaich (he): relating these 2 partition functions into exponential times 2, and be the T on the right hand side.

437
00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.880
just 2 to the

438
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:51.480
David Schaich (he): I could probably Co. Assign to the to the and power of data

439
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.070
David Schaich (he): on the left hand side.

440
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.140
David Schaich (he): And, what's more, the

441
00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:03.820
David Schaich (he): specific inverse temperatures, Beta and Beta Tila have a very particular relation

442
00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:07.260
David Schaich (he): with each other. given by

443
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.120
David Schaich (he): the relation of the sign of 2. Beta

444
00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:16.430
David Schaich (he): is the inverse hyperbolic sign a 2 beta to

445
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:26.030
David Schaich (he): we are. We can note from this relation that if we have some small data corresponding to a high temperature

446
00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.230
David Schaich (he): on either side

447
00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.870
David Schaich (he): of this equation, maybe one over

448
00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:33.070
David Schaich (he): the

449
00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:40.620
David Schaich (he): since that same value would correspond to for sure.

450
00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:44.440
David Schaich (he): In other words. we would have him

451
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:57.160
David Schaich (he): small. Beta gives you a small value of the cinch which we relies on the factor in the denominator. They are getting very large. large value of Beta tilde, and it looked temperature

452
00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.160
David Schaich (he): on this

453
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:06.200
David Schaich (he): relation. But it's now known as the Duality is, is one of the earliest example.

454
00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:20.300
David Schaich (he): The pillar of modern theoretical physics? No, it has reality more generally where you will be.

455
00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:27.000
David Schaich (he): The famous examples you might have heard of is so called Ads cft duality.

456
00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:31.390
David Schaich (he): We're holographic to all of you where

457
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:36.830
David Schaich (he): it can. Formal field theory in some number of the dimensions

458
00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.250
David Schaich (he): is deleted

459
00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:47.050
David Schaich (he): to quantum gravity in an asymptotically, and you consider ads space in D plus one dimensions.

460
00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:51.660
David Schaich (he): That is a much more complicated sort of duality

461
00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:52.730
David Schaich (he): that

462
00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:57.280
David Schaich (he): has grown out of these sorts of relations

463
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.550
David Schaich (he): which this

464
00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:03.430
David Schaich (he): connection between 2 using model partition functions was an early example.

465
00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:16.810
David Schaich (he): So, having written down this duality, the connection between partition functions at the values of temperatures implicitly given on this relation we can

466
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:21.400
David Schaich (he): the call. So in 2 dimensions we know that

467
00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:28.030
David Schaich (he): there is a phase. Transition also. Group solution tells us that, and we we field approximation agrees

468
00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:34.650
David Schaich (he): so at high temperatures. You can expect this system to be in the disorder phase

469
00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:39.110
David Schaich (he): at low temperatures. It is in the ordered phase.

470
00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:41.270
David Schaich (he): and

471
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:47.130
David Schaich (he): even without knowing that there is a phase transition we saw ordered in disorder phases by considering

472
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:53.630
David Schaich (he): high and low temperature limits. In the first place. if we make the assumption.

473
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:56.390
David Schaich (he): and that

474
00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:00.430
David Schaich (he): there is a phase transition.

475
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:03.980
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Some critical temperature Tc.

476
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:11.580
David Schaich (he): Or equivalently one over a critical, inverse temperature. Beta Sea.

477
00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:16.300
David Schaich (he): Then at that phase transition

478
00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.870
David Schaich (he): the ordered and disorder phases

479
00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:29.700
David Schaich (he): are going to meet and coincide precisely at this value of the critical signature

480
00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:39.070
David Schaich (he): which means at this relation.

481
00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:46.690
David Schaich (he): has to hold with Beta actually equal to

482
00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:57.740
David Schaich (he): this critical point. which then means that the square of the hyperbolic sign

483
00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:02.240
David Schaich (he): up to Beta, c. Is just one.

484
00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.520
David Schaich (he): so that

485
00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:07.380
David Schaich (he): pay the c. In itself

486
00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:10.900
David Schaich (he): is one half the

487
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:18.460
David Schaich (he): oh one. and something that I

488
00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:25.660
David Schaich (he): don't expect you to know off the top of your head, but can be looked up is a relation between

489
00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:29.450
David Schaich (he): the arc cinch and a logarithm that it

490
00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:37.570
David Schaich (he): I was just from the relation between the cinch itself and exponential factors. So the

491
00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:49.010
David Schaich (he): some value. Hex turns out to be the logarithm of X. What the square root of x squared plus one

492
00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:55.670
David Schaich (he): when x equals one, and then we have an expression for

493
00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:09.330
David Schaich (he): oops. We've replaced the when X is one we have one plus roots, one plus one is 2, and numerically this is from the whole point

494
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:10.380
David Schaich (he): 44.

495
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:21.340
David Schaich (he): So this is probably the duality relation. an immediate prediction that if there is a fee transition.

496
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:25.700
David Schaich (he): it must occur at this critical value of the inverse temperature.

497
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:27.130
David Schaich (he): That is an exact.

498
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:31.120
David Schaich (he): a consistency condition, another exact result.

499
00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:43.650
David Schaich (he): Yeah, for a 2 dimensional, easy model. The corresponding critical temperature is you divided by the one plus root, 2 so approximately 2 point.

500
00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:54.840
David Schaich (he): 2, 7, and Alzheimer's exact solution. Just a few years after this duality was derived in the 1940 S. Successfully.

501
00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:59.250
David Schaich (he): You produced this exact result.

502
00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:06.790
David Schaich (he): which was a very strong check that is very complicated. Calculation

503
00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:09.030
David Schaich (he): was actually correct.

504
00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:12.170
David Schaich (he): and producing the correct predictions

505
00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:17.590
David Schaich (he): for the 2D 0, clearly using model. So that is

506
00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:22.400
David Schaich (he): it for this tencast the exact results that we will confront

507
00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:29.980
David Schaich (he): at the meeting field approximation on Monday. And hopefully, it's been I to see how these sort of

508
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:41.110
David Schaich (he): exact calculations for interacting systems and proceed, despite the great, much greater detail, much greater level of complication

509
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:46.820
David Schaich (he): relative to the non interacting systems that we spent. Most of the module dealing with.
