00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.830
David Schaich (he): Okay, welcome to the promised

2
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.840
David Schaich (he): final supplemental pencast for Statistical Physics,

3
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.700
David Schaich (he): which will cover the Sommerfeld expansion.

4
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.250
David Schaich (he): It has been delayed for a couple of days, due to medical reasons,

5
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.610
David Schaich (he): so this recording is happening on the nineteenth of May, and

6
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.170
David Schaich (he): that means I should reassure you that the Sommerfeld

7
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.510
David Schaich (he): expansion is not going to be on the exam that is just a week away.  But following through this

8
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.980
David Schaich (he): somewhat less-trivial

9
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.580
David Schaich (he): calculation, to get some more interesting results for the non-relativistic fermion gases,

10
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.150
David Schaich (he): may well be a useful way to spend some time in preparation for that exam.  And hopefully it is

11
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.940
David Schaich (he): interesting and enjoyable in and of itself.

12
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:12.670
David Schaich (he): So the starting point for looking at the Sommerfeld expansion is to recall the general expressions that we had for

13
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.670
David Schaich (he): non-relativistic fermion gases,

14
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.860
David Schaich (he): where the

15
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.930
David Schaich (he): the average particle number

16
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.940
David Schaich (he): proportional to an integral

17
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.610
David Schaich (he): of the family function. We did buy square root of energy

18
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.290
over the energy.

19
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.660
David Schaich (he): and then

20
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.940
David Schaich (he): I almost the same.

21
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.540
David Schaich (he): This, with each of the particles.

22
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.960
David Schaich (he): waited by its energy to give an additional factor around.

23
00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.420
David Schaich (he): now prompt. So we to the 3 half power rather than just to to the one half, with some constant proportionality.

24
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.960
David Schaich (he): that we arrived

25
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.449
David Schaich (he): in the ordinary lectures

26
00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.980
David Schaich (he): to go beyond the approximation that

27
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.960
David Schaich (he): we used in those lectures

28
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.210
David Schaich (he): which was to replace that fairy function

29
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.870
David Schaich (he): as a step function

30
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.450
asymptotically

31
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.160
David Schaich (he): low temperatures.

32
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.820
David Schaich (he): and when we go beyond that approximation we will get a couple of nice results

33
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.810
David Schaich (he): pretty easily. We will.

34
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.030
David Schaich (he): The heat capacity

35
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.540
David Schaich (he): of these gases at low temperatures, but

36
00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:01.120
David Schaich (he): the non-zero temperature so bringing in corrections to the heat capacity that the step function just get to be

37
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.140
David Schaich (he): 0.

38
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:16.320
David Schaich (he): This is something we went through quickly in one of the tutorials. Here we will do it with all of the constant in place we Don't find merely the functional form, but also the prediction. For

39
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:24.640
David Schaich (he): how do you experimental measurements we looked at actually relates to properties of these gases like their family energy.

40
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.230
David Schaich (he): and the physical cost is like 5. We will also be able to check out the

41
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.700
David Schaich (he): temperature dependence on the chemical potential

42
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.260
David Schaich (he): you

43
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.790
David Schaich (he): and see how that

44
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.520
David Schaich (he): approaches the high temperature, classical limits.

45
00:03:51.030 --> 00:04:00.320
David Schaich (he): and also get expressions for it in terms of the zoom account expansion at low temperatures, but still not so low that this step function

46
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.810
David Schaich (he): is a valid approximation.

47
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:10.940
David Schaich (he): So a useful first step to this project is to simplify or streamline

48
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.480
David Schaich (he): notation, that we use slightly.

49
00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:28.740
David Schaich (he): This will make it easier to keep track of all of those physical constants that we just neglected in the tutorial. So, looking at the average particle number, for instance.

50
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:40.180
David Schaich (he): we will write this as an integral of some function. G of the multiply by the over to you we are.

51
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.740
David Schaich (he): You can tell what this G of is going to have you screwed the in it. You will also have

52
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:54.940
David Schaich (he): the constant proportionality factor. So we can write that as it comes to you, not

53
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.410
David Schaich (he): times the square root of the and that constantly derived in the lecture we can look back to those notes

54
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.980
David Schaich (he): point to the for me on mask You

55
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.460
David Schaich (he): factors are high-squared.

56
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.930
David Schaich (he): and then the functional dependence, square root, E to the log at the end.

57
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.280
David Schaich (he): So this is known

58
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.590
David Schaich (he): as the density of States.

59
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.480
David Schaich (he): and what that means in that

60
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.910
David Schaich (he): to explain English is.

61
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.320
David Schaich (he): This is the number of single particle energy levels

62
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.010
David Schaich (he): that our presence in the gaps.

63
00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.780
David Schaich (he): So. in order to compute the number of particles that we have.

64
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.210
David Schaich (he): you can see that we are integrating over the number of single particle energy levels

65
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.140
David Schaich (he): multiplying by to you.

66
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.820
David Schaich (he): You know what that is right down here.

67
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.110
David Schaich (he): So it's

68
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.670
David Schaich (he): essentially the occupation, probability, the occupation number for

69
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.780
David Schaich (he): an energy level with energy, e and chemical potential mute.

70
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.280
David Schaich (he): and this comes into the integral over energies

71
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.440
David Schaich (he): as the

72
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:47.430
David Schaich (he): probability that each of these single particle energy levels counted by the density of states

73
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.230
David Schaich (he): is actually occupied. I You' from my a particle.

74
00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:03.210
David Schaich (he): so that is, through the English language interpretation of our integral. We want to get the average number of particles

75
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:12.520
David Schaich (he): we want to integrate over the number of single particle energy levels that are presence weighted by the probability that those energy levels are occupied.

76
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:19.040
David Schaich (he): So we can the a sort of visual appreciation for this.

77
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.210
David Schaich (he): Looking at a couple of illustrations.

78
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:28.650
David Schaich (he): I'm sure there's introduction to books on the reading list.

79
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.150
David Schaich (he): So this is

80
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.270
David Schaich (he): the case that you've essentially been considering in the lectures up to now.

81
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.660
David Schaich (he): when the temperature is exactly 0,

82
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.120
David Schaich (he): here we function

83
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.610
David Schaich (he): because exactly the step function.

84
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.490
David Schaich (he): So it is one up to

85
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.540
David Schaich (he): the fair, the energy. This is the value of the chemical potential.

86
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.510
David Schaich (he): It's your temperature

87
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:11.060
David Schaich (he): for the is 0 for all energies larger than that fairy energy. So the integral giving us the average particle number is just shown by the sheeted region

88
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.790
in here.

89
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:24.920
David Schaich (he): Gmb itself has to the States is integrated up to that hard cut off given by the step function. I actually use it just it Constant times the square root

90
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.000
David Schaich (he): of you.

91
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.059
David Schaich (he): so that she the region

92
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:42.220
David Schaich (he): it's the integral over G of the by itself, up to the cut off by the step. One

93
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:43.860
David Schaich (he): so

94
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:52.290
David Schaich (he): more complicated behavior that we now need to consider in order to get some more interesting results. is what happens

95
00:08:52.760 --> 00:09:02.030
David Schaich (he): when the temperature is still small, but now and 0 to the point where that step function is not the approximation that we want to make.

96
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:14.920
David Schaich (he): So do you picture that changes to something like this, which is no what's going on there? The projector There it is.

97
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.530
David Schaich (he): So not quite the same axes.

98
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:32.190
David Schaich (he): This dashed line here, and the same density of states that we had for 0 temperature in New York with the est of States is independence of the temperature. He is, so

99
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:37.980
David Schaich (he): that number of single particle energy levels per unit energy is determined by the

100
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.600
David Schaich (he): characteristics of the system. and the

101
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.270
David Schaich (he): sure the calls are fairly function that would be this

102
00:09:48.360 --> 00:10:00.250
David Schaich (he): in bar. This is our F of the in our notation and the dashboard. Now is the you.

103
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:07.440
David Schaich (he): It's a grant of our integral the product of the density of States times, the occupation of.

104
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:14.580
David Schaich (he): and in addition to the stark shed region over here, it can come out so well in this print out.

105
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.200
David Schaich (he): but there is some

106
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.930
David Schaich (he): probability that it is not 0, although actually, that should be suppressed.

107
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.400
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

108
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.130
David Schaich (he): having particles that occupy energy levels with energies greater.

109
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:33.710
David Schaich (he): The net can be energy. You don't want to have a step function kind of off the integral, and

110
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.570
David Schaich (he): if you have any energy.

111
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:41.130
David Schaich (he): so we integrate over the whole range of energies from 0 to infinity.

112
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.410
David Schaich (he): That gives us the particle number in this case.

113
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.040
David Schaich (he): and because this fermi energy

114
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.780
David Schaich (he): is set by the number of particles, and look back in your notes to

115
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.850
David Schaich (he): see you that definition.

116
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:08.080
David Schaich (he): we will be coming up. So we produce it here briefly.

117
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.020
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Constant factors of

118
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.920
David Schaich (he): a 3 pi squared

119
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.630
David Schaich (he): yeah overall to the

120
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:27.110
David Schaich (he): we have power. Sorry that's the two-thirds. How are you

121
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.100
David Schaich (he): So

122
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.900
David Schaich (he): if we have some of these end up particles occupying

123
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:47.100
David Schaich (he): energy levels with energy is market and the energy. This means that there's a one of those occupied energy levels.

124
00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.290
David Schaich (he): energy levels.

125
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:59.680
David Schaich (he): lower energy side of the pyramid energy. So the difference between

126
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.430
David Schaich (he): we did integral with a non-trivial memory function.

127
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.520
David Schaich (he): and what that best you States would have been with just except function.

128
00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:20.330
David Schaich (he): This leads to a difference between the chemical potential

129
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.070
David Schaich (he): that is the overall label

130
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:33.990
David Schaich (he): on this figure compared to its value, the ferry energy at t equals 0, and in particular

131
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:46.000
David Schaich (he): we will see you that and a shell in this figure the chemical potential for knowledge. Your temperature is always going to be less than

132
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:53.980
David Schaich (he): if You' me energy. let me just. of course, some of these take away messages. There is.

133
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.080
David Schaich (he): We have

134
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.910
David Schaich (he): non-zero value of t and don't approximate the fermat

135
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.280
David Schaich (he): function as a step function.

136
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.270
David Schaich (he): You have

137
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.170
David Schaich (he): some particles

138
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:26.130
David Schaich (he): occupy energy levels with energy is greater than the fermi energy.

139
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.530
The probability to do so is

140
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.950
David Schaich (he): exponentially suppressed

141
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.760
David Schaich (he): correspondingly.

142
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.100
David Schaich (he): There are.

143
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.570
David Schaich (he): i'm not you. Part of it.

144
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:49.550
David Schaich (he): Energy levels with energy, is less than the family energy.

145
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.680
David Schaich (he): And If we recall that

146
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.600
David Schaich (he): points on the x-axis

147
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.250
David Schaich (he): to the value of the energy to the chemical potential

148
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.520
David Schaich (he): is where that

149
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:09.630
David Schaich (he): argument of the exponential function is 0 the fermi energy.

150
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:18.780
David Schaich (he): just value of one over one plus one is 2. Similarly, you see.

151
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.890
David Schaich (he): Oh, this one of it. Excuse me there!

152
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.390
David Schaich (he): So hopefully it's settled down. Now, if we

153
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.360
David Schaich (he): set the fermi energy to be to have

154
00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:37.140
David Schaich (he): and look for the point where the dash. This on the line is one half of the

155
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.940
David Schaich (he): value of the dash line that it would have been

156
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.050
David Schaich (he): with the step function that will give us

157
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:50.340
David Schaich (he): the value of the energy that is equal to the and one of the

158
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.080
David Schaich (he): results we will compute zoom is that the chemical potential for

159
00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:02.420
David Schaich (he): in non-zero value temperature? It's always going to be less than the fermi energy.

160
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.910
David Schaich (he): which is, we have defined in the lectures

161
00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:11.220
David Schaich (he): to be the chemical potential exactly absolute 0 for sure.

162
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:18.010
David Schaich (he): So that is our first goal to to go for.

163
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.130
David Schaich (he): and

164
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.560
David Schaich (he): we can just evaluate. You need to go

165
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.300
David Schaich (he): that we have for the

166
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.360
David Schaich (he): average particle number.

167
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:39.480
David Schaich (he): This is the better starting point. You have a G. 0

168
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.000
David Schaich (he): it to the left hand side of the equation. so that on the right hand side

169
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.400
David Schaich (he): we just have

170
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.900
David Schaich (he): an integral over energies of

171
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.810
David Schaich (he): use. The would have power

172
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.130
David Schaich (he): integrated over.

173
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.830
David Schaich (he): And then importantly, here

174
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.870
David Schaich (he): an executive following, and not just a proportionality.

175
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:21.280
David Schaich (he): a proportional functional relation. So we are going a bit beyond what we did more quickly

176
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.200
David Schaich (he): in the tutorial on the device.

177
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:34.360
David Schaich (he): But the general procedure we are going to follow is the same one that was introduced there. This function.

178
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:46.410
David Schaich (he): which is a complicated ratio of square root of energy over an exponential function of the energy is not something we can just look up or solve exactly, or even

179
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:53.630
David Schaich (he): you, to a program like mathematic. If you do for us. we need to bring in some

180
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.410
David Schaich (he): intelligence through the analysis of it, and the approach

181
00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:06.560
David Schaich (he): here's the same that was quickly sketched out in that tutorial integrate my parts pretty much integral hands.

182
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:16.099
David Schaich (he): the product of 2 functions that you. that you will be the TV is everything else.

183
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.240
David Schaich (he): and then

184
00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:26.819
David Schaich (he): integrate my parts to give us the boundary terms of you. Time speed. So you need to

185
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:38.280
David Schaich (he): introduce the antiderivative of using the one half, which is 2, taking the derivative of that will cancel out

186
00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:43.490
David Schaich (he): 3 half of 2 thirds, and the the one half that remains

187
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.500
David Schaich (he): so the boundary term

188
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:53.430
David Schaich (he): two-thirds. These are the 3 halves out of the

189
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:59.640
David Schaich (he): it's 0 and infinity. and then we subtract

190
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.770
David Schaich (he): so it's still like 2 thirds

191
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.060
David Schaich (he): same limits of integration.

192
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:22.370
David Schaich (he): and keeping things on the object to it. We have either the 3 halves on the and then the you is going to be the derivative of all that fairly functioning

193
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:27.300
David Schaich (he): with respect to energy. integrating over the energy.

194
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.430
David Schaich (he): Now

195
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:46.020
David Schaich (he): we have seen in the lectures that the fermi function here is very similar to the occupation number. or a fairly gas and

196
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:53.920
David Schaich (he): or fairly honestly. Occupation number has 2 extreme limits. It can be 0, or it can be one, and there is no other option.

197
00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:56.270
David Schaich (he): indeed

198
00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:05.890
David Schaich (he): Limit that the energy goes to infinity to the upper limit of the evaluation of this boundary term. That's where we get. If you're a function of 0.

199
00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:12.250
David Schaich (he): We have one over E to the infinity plus one. There is exponential suppression that overwhelms

200
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.490
David Schaich (he): the either. The 3 half is also going to infinity. If you don't

201
00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:21.440
David Schaich (he): want to take my one for it, you can hit that ratio.

202
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:26.460
David Schaich (he): and we'll kill off the in the numerator, the exponential which is, keep going

203
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.630
David Schaich (he): all remedy

204
00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:32.680
David Schaich (he): iterations of what we want to go through. So we have 0 from the upper limit

205
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.180
David Schaich (he): at the moment. That is where

206
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.530
David Schaich (he): the fermi function approaches one.

207
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:44.360
David Schaich (he): you know, one over perfect. each of the minus made of you.

208
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.590
David Schaich (he): So we don't know what that is, plus one

209
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.100
David Schaich (he): that even the minus paid renew is itself just a

210
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:58.340
David Schaich (he): number and low temperatures that we consider here. You know that

211
00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:09.050
David Schaich (he): you is positive. The temperature beta is always positive. so we will have something less than one and greater than 0 multiplied by 0.

212
00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:10.740
David Schaich (he): He's known to his friends

213
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.750
David Schaich (he): and 0 for both of those upward over limits.

214
00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:21.660
David Schaich (he): So all that is left is the the main integral

215
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.640
David Schaich (he): integrating over Pdu, or which we want to compute

216
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:27.630
David Schaich (he): the

217
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.600
David Schaich (he): negative derivative of

218
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.240
David Schaich (he): the fermi function with respect to energy

219
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.510
David Schaich (he): back up of the inject turn.

220
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:49.680
David Schaich (he): So that can be a function. You can write it as you to the Beta energy minus chemical potential. plus one to the minus one power.

221
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:56.690
David Schaich (he): the derivative of that minus one powerable cancel out to the overall negative sign taken from that.

222
00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.870
David Schaich (he): 2 thirds people have a

223
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:04.240
David Schaich (he): the exponential function. Now

224
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.230
David Schaich (he): the 2 power, so one over that

225
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:20.010
David Schaich (he): one D squared the exponential. bring the exponential into the numerator and then bring down a factor of Beta.

226
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:30.580
David Schaich (he): and just to reduce the amount that I have to write. and I plug this back in 2. Your whole expression

227
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.260
the terms that they want to be x

228
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:36.970
it to be

229
00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.880
David Schaich (he): be that

230
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.500
David Schaich (he): e to the x plus one squared.

231
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:51.630
David Schaich (he): So what's of that back in and that

232
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.660
David Schaich (he): see what we have.

233
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:58.340
David Schaich (he): This is a

234
00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:04.110
David Schaich (he): procedure and an argument that we want to more quickly for the energy and the

235
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.250
David Schaich (he): so you results.

236
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.770
David Schaich (he): They look

237
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:14.820
David Schaich (he): somewhat familiar now with equal science rather than

238
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.330
David Schaich (he): proportionality factors to you

239
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:34.800
David Schaich (he): overall negative two-thirds. The negative has been incident two-thirds remains we are integrating from 0 to infinity of it's the

240
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:42.360
David Schaich (he): over in the X plus one squared. We have either the 3 halves

241
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.390
David Schaich (he): and I will go ahead and

242
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.760
David Schaich (he): the factor of Beta into the

243
00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.660
David Schaich (he): differential. In this integral. the it is a

244
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:02.280
David Schaich (he): of the real numbers. So that's not changing the limits of integration here.

245
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:08.160
David Schaich (he): What I do want to changes to is to work in terms of the X rather than Dd.

246
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:12.280
David Schaich (he): So when is 0,

247
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.540
David Schaich (he): X is minus new data.

248
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:20.310
David Schaich (he): they use infinity. So is X. So the overall expression

249
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:22.770
David Schaich (he): that we have

250
00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.210
David Schaich (he): integrates from

251
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.820
David Schaich (he): the x plus one square

252
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:37.400
David Schaich (he): energy to the 3 half power times the X. And this is a

253
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.490
David Schaich (he): all right

254
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.530
David Schaich (he): application, because

255
00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:50.570
David Schaich (he): the energy is now a function of X, which is being integrated over. So we need to

256
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.500
David Schaich (he): get that doing a factor of

257
00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:58.510
David Schaich (he): energy to the 3 half power in terms of X's.

258
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:02.590
David Schaich (he): it's integral.

259
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:05.440
David Schaich (he): And

260
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.400
David Schaich (he): yeah motivation. For doing this, we use

261
00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:17.550
David Schaich (he): went through the argument. We we in the tutorial. We'll review it a bit, more probably

262
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.690
David Schaich (he): to right now that

263
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:25.500
David Schaich (he): this overall ratio of exponentials is

264
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.180
David Schaich (he): a function that is shortly peaked.

265
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:38.280
David Schaich (he): A random X equals 0, which we can see in a couple of ways.

266
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.040
David Schaich (he): First getting some motivation like

267
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:51.870
David Schaich (he): reviewing the figure that we discussed in the tutorial, which is just fine at E to the X over give the x plus one quality squared. and seeing that there is a peak

268
00:24:52.330 --> 00:25:01.430
David Schaich (he): and X equals 0, You're expressed in terms of the definition of x be. There's Times energy minus chemical potential.

269
00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:10.470
David Schaich (he): and by the time we get a few units away from 0 there is an exponential suppression, so that the long tables are contributing essentially nothing

270
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.110
David Schaich (he): to this integral

271
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.100
David Schaich (he): the other way of establishing.

272
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:24.240
David Schaich (he): Yes. this ratio is shortly peaked around. X equals 0 is to consider

273
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:35.820
David Schaich (he): how it behaves. Well. X is much more than one much smaller than minus one. So I guess you have to in the next.

274
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:41.200
David Schaich (he): It's away from 0. So starting with the negative sign

275
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.990
David Schaich (he): X, much less than one Use that

276
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.130
David Schaich (he): E to the X is a very small number

277
00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:57.290
David Schaich (he): manageable, and added to one to this ratio of approximately E to the X over one squared

278
00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:05.240
David Schaich (he): she's one. and then we're like with the next. which itself is an exponentially small number

279
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.680
David Schaich (he): coming from the

280
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.320
David Schaich (he): large negative argument to the exponential function.

281
00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.820
David Schaich (he): The tax is much greater than one. then

282
00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:25.370
David Schaich (he): use the one that is, next to both in comparison to the exponentially enhanced E. To the nominator.

283
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.860
David Schaich (he): We you to the twox.

284
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.240
David Schaich (he): you to the X. Next to a large number in the in the denominator

285
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:39.510
David Schaich (he): again. is much less than what.

286
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:41.880
David Schaich (he): So

287
00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:48.460
David Schaich (he): this sharp peak around X equals 0

288
00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:57.870
David Schaich (he): allows us to evaluate this integral by making 2 approximations that introduce can be exponentially small

289
00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:58.950
David Schaich (he): alright.

290
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:01.480
David Schaich (he): errors

291
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:06.760
David Schaich (he): that we can neglect as our approximation.

292
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.990
David Schaich (he): and there are in particular, 2

293
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:19.300
David Schaich (he): approximations you will bring to available. First of those is to extend

294
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.730
David Schaich (he): the range of this integral.

295
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:28.320
David Schaich (he): so minus to infinity

296
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:35.170
David Schaich (he): can be extended over the whole range of energies from a whole range of X's.

297
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:44.940
David Schaich (he): From negative infinity to

298
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:53.660
David Schaich (he): would. emphasizing when doing this, that this home is because Beta is positive

299
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:58.250
David Schaich (he): and view is positive for the low temperatures that we

300
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.000
David Schaich (he): remain interested. Yeah.

301
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:13.490
David Schaich (he): that the slow temperatures give us a large value of beta positive value of you. So we are already quite close to negative infinity in this integral.

302
00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:14.780
David Schaich (he): at least

303
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:22.120
David Schaich (he): relative to the small range over which the integrand is non negligible.

304
00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:35.290
David Schaich (he): This is exponentially accurate approximation that simplifies integrations to be able to integrate from minus infinity to infinity rather than so minus.

305
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:45.250
David Schaich (he): And the second approximation is to expand the energy as a function of X

306
00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.850
David Schaich (he): around X equals 0, which is the point.

307
00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.800
The energy

308
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:56.260
David Schaich (he): equals the chemical potential. So the energy, the 3 halves.

309
00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:59.720
David Schaich (he): It is going to be a

310
00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.910
David Schaich (he): approximately to the 3 halves, plus

311
00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:08.860
David Schaich (he): small corrections that we can compute with a your expansion.

312
00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:13.910
David Schaich (he): So

313
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.060
David Schaich (he): you can recall that the Taylor expansion

314
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.030
David Schaich (he): brings in the you

315
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:24.830
David Schaich (he): difference between the function and the points it's being expanded right.

316
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:38.390
David Schaich (he): I should say the function, I should say the variable that the function is expressed in terms of in this case. E. The expanded around the chemical. Essentially you. When we take the

317
00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:53.400
David Schaich (he): derivative with respect to that variable. the function itself evaluate that derivative at the central value he equals mute. and keep continuing to higher and higher terms.

318
00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.350
David Schaich (he): It's higher higher powers of the difference in this view.

319
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.240
David Schaich (he): and the precise

320
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:08.500
David Schaich (he): coefficients that come from the expansion

321
00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:15.710
David Schaich (he): machine learning 2 derivatives. In the second term

322
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.570
David Schaich (he): you can evaluate that e equals view.

323
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.640
David Schaich (he): and I

324
00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:28.110
David Schaich (he): use the approximately equal sign, because I'm just going to truncate this series right here rather than putting in a bigger notation to capture

325
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.390
David Schaich (he): all of the higher order terms.

326
00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:38.840
David Schaich (he): so we can easily take the derivative of E to the 3 halves with respect to E.

327
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:41.960
David Schaich (he): That is going to give us

328
00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:54.330
David Schaich (he): if we have. and you minus me, and then and e to the one over 2 remains when we set the so we get to the one half power.

329
00:30:55.270 --> 00:31:01.060
David Schaich (he): Similarly, when we take 2 derivatives, we get to be 3 halves, and they want to have times in one half

330
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:04.320
David Schaich (he): is a 3 over 2,

331
00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:14.550
David Schaich (he): that same minus m squared. And now the power on the is going down from 3 halves to one half to minus a half.

332
00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:20.910
David Schaich (he): I said to Mute. and we can

333
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:29.650
David Schaich (he): use our definition of X in terms of E minus new. to

334
00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.210
David Schaich (he): write this expression in terms

335
00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.000
David Schaich (he): of X in temperature.

336
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:45.240
David Schaich (he): So e minus view is x over beta, which is x times the temperature which gives us

337
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:53.650
David Schaich (he): you to the 3 halves 3 halves times x t.

338
00:31:54.740 --> 00:32:02.370
David Schaich (he): One have power view. and then 3, 8 times x T. Squared.

339
00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:09.890
David Schaich (he): It's a negative one over 2 factor of mute. And this, indeed is

340
00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.670
David Schaich (he): the

341
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.660
David Schaich (he): so. It's over

342
00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.640
David Schaich (he): expansion

343
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.740
David Schaich (he): that is, family for

344
00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:26.390
David Schaich (he): small values of the temperature.

345
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:37.150
David Schaich (he): where we end up with an expansion in terms of this X times T. Or expo the data. and with the small temperature. You

346
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.170
David Schaich (he): end up with a sharp peak in terms of X,

347
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:42.140
David Schaich (he): that

348
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:47.440
David Schaich (he): you see approximations we are making here accurate.

349
00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:59.010
David Schaich (he): and the expansion under control. and we' at the end of this Pan Chas. Is it? Briefly what happens? What we can do? Let me relax this assumption of a low temperature.

350
00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:01.140
David Schaich (he): and are not able to.

351
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.940
David Schaich (he): Maybe you control this man in this way.

352
00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.000
This is named, after all. In some repel

353
00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:10.370
David Schaich (he): I see

354
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:15.250
David Schaich (he): a fairly basic series of approximations. Starting with integrations by parts.

355
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.880
David Schaich (he): He was the one who

356
00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:25.360
David Schaich (he): popularize this when these very direct integrals first popped into physics in the early twentieth century.

357
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:36.130
David Schaich (he): after the initial development of autumn statistics. So what we now have is

358
00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:41.130
David Schaich (he): something that does not quite fit all in the projector

359
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:49.290
David Schaich (he): you want to plug in this expansion of either 3 half power into this integral.

360
00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:54.870
David Schaich (he): the integration range extended to infinity this gives us.

361
00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:59.260
David Schaich (he): is you some

362
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.350
David Schaich (he): oh, 3 simpler integrals

363
00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:16.300
David Schaich (he): that's we can either evaluate by hand, or looked up on Wikipedia, or a similar resource.

364
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:23.110
David Schaich (he): without any difficulty. without anything like the difficulty we would have had

365
00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:27.400
David Schaich (he): with that E as a function of X. That is, a function of X

366
00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.560
David Schaich (he): lingering in the into grand.

367
00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:32.900
David Schaich (he): So

368
00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:37.150
David Schaich (he): the average particle number

369
00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:46.880
David Schaich (he): keeping track of all of the constants in terms of that with these approximations has

370
00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.389
David Schaich (he): an overall factor of two-thirds

371
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:53.770
David Schaich (he): times. The first term is a

372
00:34:54.770 --> 00:35:05.160
David Schaich (he): potentially the free house power and then the integral itself. It's just integrating from minus infinity to infinity over the ratio of exponentials.

373
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.280
David Schaich (he): I will all that to some

374
00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:13.200
David Schaich (he): number the result of that integration.

375
00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:14.280
David Schaich (he): Hey, you.

376
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:18.830
we'll face. I sub 0.

377
00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:23.780
David Schaich (he): We are. and I some 0 is

378
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.630
David Schaich (he): plus one squared.

379
00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:34.650
David Schaich (he): and

380
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:41.730
David Schaich (he): you will next 2 terms in the expansion.

381
00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:47.940
David Schaich (he): The 2 thirds and 3 have to cancel out. We just have

382
00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:54.340
David Schaich (he): 18 square root of chemical potential.

383
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:57.250
David Schaich (he): and then the integral I one

384
00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.680
David Schaich (he): that is

385
00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.280
David Schaich (he): just has

386
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:14.970
David Schaich (he): a factor of thanks problem in the second term in the summer field expansion. I'm. In the wall

387
00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.830
David Schaich (he): integral

388
00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:26.990
David Schaich (he): again. Similarly. the final term is 4 times smaller than the previous one.

389
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:29.970
David Schaich (he): We have a t squared

390
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:36.120
David Schaich (he): useful. What happened to the now

391
00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.330
David Schaich (he): Oops? Okay

392
00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:45.890
David Schaich (he): on the projector. And this comes with you through it to go I 2. Yeah.

393
00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.280
David Schaich (he): 2 factors of X

394
00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:57.360
David Schaich (he): in the numerator. So we have a sequence

395
00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:04.780
David Schaich (he): Sorry. 2 factors of X in the numerator there. So a sequence of 3 quite similar integrals

396
00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.290
David Schaich (he): for us to

397
00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:12.590
David Schaich (he): either figure out for ourselves or look up as appropriate.

398
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:21.910
David Schaich (he): The first one is not too hard to figure out for ourselves, because we have seen that actually that

399
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:26.530
David Schaich (he): this he to the X over E to the x plus one squared.

400
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.770
David Schaich (he): is related

401
00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:32.500
David Schaich (he): the

402
00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.920
David Schaich (he): function with respect to the energy.

403
00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:44.780
David Schaich (he): the only difference that we have in here is this overall factor of Beta that we can't have a zoom

404
00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.300
David Schaich (he): into. Yeah.

405
00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:55.810
David Schaich (he): the X, The hex is

406
00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:05.620
David Schaich (he): going to be proportional to beta de that we get

407
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:15.660
David Schaich (he): the relation between the derivative of the primary function and the ratio of exponentials. Just converse the X to the E.

408
00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:24.330
David Schaich (he): Because we have extended the range of integration that stays the same. Never x goes to or minus infinity, so to see, and vice versa.

409
00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:37.610
David Schaich (he): and you know the probably fundamental more calculus that the integral of a derivative just gives the function itself

410
00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:43.480
David Schaich (he): and its limits of integration.

411
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:55.350
David Schaich (he): And you've gone through this argument already. You're calling me all the family function. When the energy goes to infinity the function goes to 0.

412
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:58.950
David Schaich (he): The energy goes to minus infinity

413
00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:00.470
David Schaich (he): goes to one

414
00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.250
David Schaich (he): assuming a

415
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.620
David Schaich (he): it's assuming a constant chemical potential which we can.

416
00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.750
David Schaich (he): So we have

417
00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:21.560
David Schaich (he): a minus 0 from the upper limit of integration. and then

418
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:26.510
David Schaich (he): that will be very simple results. For this 5 0 is just one

419
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.870
David Schaich (he): I One is deeply symbol, which we can

420
00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.440
David Schaich (he): rewrite it in a suggestive way.

421
00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.200
David Schaich (he): So writing

422
00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:42.990
David Schaich (he): factors

423
00:39:47.250 --> 00:40:01.050
David Schaich (he): like so we can divide through by E to the X in the denominator. I'll divide it through that second factor, so it cancels out the E to the X

424
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:04.030
David Schaich (he): minus x

425
00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.120
one.

426
00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:13.370
David Schaich (he): and this is useful because you can see that the denominator

427
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.650
David Schaich (he): in this integrand is symmetric under swapping

428
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:28.250
David Schaich (he): X to minus x. that is to say, it is an even function of X, whereas the numerator is an odd function of X. It changes sign

429
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:30.710
David Schaich (he): when the X changes sign

430
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:38.270
David Schaich (he): so integrating symmetrically around 0. Thanks to our extension of the domain, the integration

431
00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:50.470
David Schaich (he): we have an overall all ratio on, divided by even function. integrated, symmetric around 0, You, 0 and

432
00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:54.530
David Schaich (he): proportional to the temperature

433
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:58.170
David Schaich (he): in his own health. Expansion just drops out

434
00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.850
David Schaich (he): for that reason.

435
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.700
David Schaich (he): What do you I' to go?

436
00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.500
David Schaich (he): You'll be useful to

437
00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:16.860
David Schaich (he): integrated by parts again, and for that it's also useful to note that would.

438
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:31.030
David Schaich (he): In fact. we go through the same rewriting of the integrand. We get an even function so rather than situating from minus infinity to infinity.

439
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:34.680
David Schaich (he): We can just integrate from 0 to the double the result.

440
00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:38.070
David Schaich (he): That's what even function is because

441
00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:41.940
David Schaich (he): you don't need to.

442
00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:56.900
David Schaich (he): We write the Instagram in any way, we will just go ahead and integrate this by parts with a new that is equal to X squared the TV. That is

443
00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.440
David Schaich (he): everything else

444
00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:04.650
David Schaich (he): of exponentials. Dx. And then

445
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:17.000
David Schaich (he): this means, as we have seen, from the connection between this ratio and the family function That's B itself is going to be one over

446
00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:31.250
David Schaich (he): negative sign. We're taking the derivative of B with respect to X. Just bring his name negative one to power. and then an E to the X on top from the chain rule.

447
00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:36.650
David Schaich (he): So the

448
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:41.190
David Schaich (he): overall factor of 2 minus 2 X squared.

449
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:45.990
David Schaich (he): and the

450
00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:47.590
David Schaich (he): then plus

451
00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.750
David Schaich (he): the integral of V. D. U,

452
00:42:52.420 --> 00:43:05.820
David Schaich (he): the U. Is 2 X. Dx. And what we have done by integrated by parts is reduced the power to which that E to the X possible, and it is being raised in the denominator.

453
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:09.030
David Schaich (he): Before we go to

454
00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.520
David Schaich (he): that

455
00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:24.140
David Schaich (he): remaining integral, we can consider the down return here. When X is 0. We have minus 2 times 0 over 2, which is from 0.

456
00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:36.020
David Schaich (he): When X is infinity. Again, we can look at this hall. this ratio of infinity over infinity as much as we like the Polynomial will die off the exponential or not. So we get

457
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.490
David Schaich (he): 0

458
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.540
David Schaich (he): from both the that as before.

459
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.380
David Schaich (he): so all that we have left is this.

460
00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.430
David Schaich (he): i'm open to global

461
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:51.410
David Schaich (he): of 4

462
00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.640
David Schaich (he): phones.

463
00:43:53.670 --> 00:44:05.340
David Schaich (he): I did you go with X over E to the X plus one, which is actually. you know, very similar to a set of integrals that we saw, and looking at the All for relativistic

464
00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:08.310
David Schaich (he): in a previous supplemental podcast.

465
00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:21.010
David Schaich (he): Let's go ahead. That is one minus one over 2 to some power. In this case that power is one. and then became a function out of 2.

466
00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:24.460
David Schaich (he): Is it a function of 2 similar to the

467
00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:30.510
David Schaich (he): 3 and 4 that we saw the relativistic for me on this

468
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.680
David Schaich (he): 4 times. One minus a half is 2

469
00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:46.790
David Schaich (he): gamma of 2 is one factorial, which is one. and Zeta 2 is pi squared over 6, so we have 2 times pi squared over 6, which just gives us pi squared over 3

470
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:49.260
David Schaich (he): for this final integral

471
00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:55.300
David Schaich (he): well, the final one that we will consider just the first

472
00:44:55.670 --> 00:45:03.840
David Schaich (he): non-trivial. The first temperature dependence correction. In the low temperature summer fell expansion. So

473
00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:08.220
David Schaich (he): you now have

474
00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:13.100
David Schaich (he): the final results. Let me see.

475
00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:21.460
David Schaich (he): I can give it on the screen as well. Yeah. Do you

476
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.620
David Schaich (he): particle number itself?

477
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:32.840
David Schaich (he): Yeah. exponentially precise approximations that we have justified for low temperatures. This is equal

478
00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:37.260
David Schaich (he): to those constant terms.

479
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:40.570
David Schaich (he): How many 2 things.

480
00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.320
David Schaich (he): what

481
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:58.050
David Schaich (he): Pi squared over 3 times a quarter. It's. I squared how it's okay, t squared. And then you one half hour

482
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:05.010
David Schaich (he): as the leading to dependent correction coming from the summer called expansion.

483
00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:15.420
David Schaich (he): and something very pleasant happens when we connect this result. Yeah. there the energy.

484
00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:19.740
David Schaich (he): So that is the

485
00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:26.920
David Schaich (he): chemical potential in the of absolute zeros. And for sure, we wrote it down

486
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:37.540
David Schaich (he): earlier, just at the bottom of with the illustrations of the next few of States. I, Wisconsin squared over 2 yeah

487
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.150
David Schaich (he): times.

488
00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.820
David Schaich (he): 3 Pi squared

489
00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.060
David Schaich (he): and 2 through his power.

490
00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.880
David Schaich (he): And if we raise both sides of this equation to the 3

491
00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.930
David Schaich (he): you find

492
00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:12.960
David Schaich (he): so that we use in terms of the parentheses just raise the one. so we will have a

493
00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:15.520
David Schaich (he): free from that. You'll have

494
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:18.630
David Schaich (he): Each part is going to go into H Bar cube

495
00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:21.850
David Schaich (he): high squared.

496
00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:30.410
David Schaich (he): He was released from that power and 2 M. To the 3 apps power.

497
00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:36.020
David Schaich (he): We can write as the square root of 2 in 2. That's

498
00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:41.930
David Schaich (he): no queue. We have a

499
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:48.400
David Schaich (he): the average particle number itself.

500
00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.950
David Schaich (he): you know. We can look back and recognize.

501
00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:03.760
David Schaich (he): I can get both on the screen here that B times through 2 and Q

502
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:05.970
David Schaich (he): high school. In each part

503
00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:11.900
David Schaich (he): you is precisely the Austin factor in the

504
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:18.840
David Schaich (he): that we have multiplying in the terms in our final results.

505
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:27.310
David Schaich (he): So there is a three-halves that is not part of

506
00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:30.400
David Schaich (he): that's.

507
00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:36.420
David Schaich (he): It's wrapped up into that collection of also factors that we have been carrying. The more

508
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.840
David Schaich (he): this whole time.

509
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:43.400
David Schaich (he): So we can. Well, here. that

510
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:48.160
David Schaich (he): machine 0 is just

511
00:48:50.540 --> 00:49:00.440
David Schaich (he): sorry. 3 halves. So you take G 0 to the left hand side. We bring you to the i'm effective

512
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:08.490
David Schaich (he): the energy to the 3 half power in here.

513
00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.030
David Schaich (he): Pretty good.

514
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.560
David Schaich (he): Hey, you pleasant cancellation

515
00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:26.220
David Schaich (he): that two-thirds times 3 halves as well. You handle this. and enough times

516
00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:32.920
David Schaich (he): we have.

517
00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:41.370
David Schaich (he): and then we have. I squared t squared You have it

518
00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:48.890
David Schaich (he): from G. 0. The 12 over 3 times 2 is 8,

519
00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:51.700
David Schaich (he): and

520
00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:56.640
David Schaich (he): we have powers of the family energy multiplying

521
00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:00.050
David Schaich (he): a one half power of the chemical potential.

522
00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:08.910
David Schaich (he): So what's nice about this is that all of these factors of the average particle number just drop out.

523
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:12.710
David Schaich (he): and

524
00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:15.330
David Schaich (he): if we

525
00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:22.880
David Schaich (he): focus on this ratio of over the fermi energy. the 3

526
00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:32.030
David Schaich (he): we can move the temperature dependent term the other side of the equation.

527
00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.020
one minus.

528
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.080
David Schaich (he): I squared

529
00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:48.920
David Schaich (he): t squared over 8 to the 3 halves. the one half. and then we take the 2 first power of both sides.

530
00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.350
David Schaich (he): Yes.

531
00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:56.160
David Schaich (he): i' it's just that ratio over fermi energy

532
00:50:56.770 --> 00:51:02.000
David Schaich (he): on the left hand side related to

533
00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:09.060
David Schaich (he): this difference between one minus a collection of constants.

534
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:14.110
David Schaich (he): It depend on t squared all that raised to the 2 first power.

535
00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:20.360
David Schaich (he): If we have the temperature, we can make 2 further approximations.

536
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:33.660
David Schaich (he): First, to that. the energy is approximately equal to M. This is the same leading order now of the same T. Or expansion that we previously had.

537
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:34.970
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

538
00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:43.550
David Schaich (he): stop it at the leaving order, because there are already 2 factors of the temperature in here. We don't need to bring in any more from higher orders.

539
00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:54.230
David Schaich (he): and if t is small compared to that family energy which now becomes every energy to the 3 house, plus one half is 2.

540
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.840
David Schaich (he): So this term is

541
00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:58.900
David Schaich (he): going to be

542
00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:03.400
David Schaich (he): a small factor of t squared over E. F. Squared.

543
00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:08.760
David Schaich (he): because that is small. you can To the expansion of

544
00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:15.400
David Schaich (he): one line is a small number to a power. It's just one minus that power times the small number.

545
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:17.500
David Schaich (he): So we get back from

546
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:22.530
David Schaich (he): 1 8 2 1, 12,

547
00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:24.570
the high squared

548
00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:31.280
David Schaich (he): over 12, and then that we feel temperature over.

549
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.500
David Schaich (he): So

550
00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:42.310
David Schaich (he): this is again the first term in the zone of expansion

551
00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:43.830
David Schaich (he): for the

552
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:50.740
David Schaich (he): chemical potential, now a lower, but not 0 T.

553
00:52:51.110 --> 00:53:01.320
David Schaich (he): So what this is telling us is that chemical potential itself we're limited that is, non-zero. It's approximately

554
00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:04.370
David Schaich (he): email minus

555
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:12.500
David Schaich (he): I squared over 12. I was t squared over Edl. the one now.

556
00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:29.560
David Schaich (he): So this correction. I'm: zoom anything negative some. and the phones Yes. the knowledge your temperature reduces new compared to its 0 temperature gallery, the energy.

557
00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:37.590
David Schaich (he): Wendy temperature is small. but not 0.

558
00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:40.740
David Schaich (he): So this is the

559
00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:43.750
David Schaich (he): that's we made earlier. I'm: looking at

560
00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:47.430
David Schaich (he): this diagram that the no material value

561
00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:56.460
David Schaich (he): of the chemical potential. The point where the fermi function is equal to a half. It's always going to be

562
00:53:56.470 --> 00:54:04.070
David Schaich (he): smaller than 0 temperature value very energy. And we have computed precisely how much smaller it is at low temperatures.

563
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:08.680
David Schaich (he): The leading effect is authentic in that most your temperature.

564
00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:14.730
David Schaich (he): So the other

565
00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:18.300
David Schaich (he): target that we had for the summer call expansion. Today.

566
00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:19.340
David Schaich (he): what is

567
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:23.230
David Schaich (he): we can get? The low temperature, heat, capacity.

568
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:24.360
David Schaich (he): which.

569
00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:27.560
David Schaich (he): as we saw, the tutorial, requires

570
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:33.560
David Schaich (he): energy rather than the average particle number.

571
00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:35.190
David Schaich (he): and that is

572
00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.610
David Schaich (he): a very similar procedure. So I will

573
00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:45.570
David Schaich (he): go through it more quickly, probably because this is the procedure that was sketched out

574
00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:49.160
David Schaich (he): without keeping track of the concept factors in the tutorial.

575
00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:53.000
David Schaich (he): So we essentially repeat the

576
00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.440
David Schaich (he): manipulations that we went through to a particle number.

577
00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:14.070
David Schaich (he): Now, looking at the internal energy of the do I through by that same constant G 0 on the desk. This is

578
00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:20.360
David Schaich (he): instead of E to the one now is either the 3 hands waited by

579
00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.890
David Schaich (he): every function, and it's written over the energy

580
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.720
David Schaich (he): and applying the

581
00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:39.410
David Schaich (he): same integration by parts. The same low temperature approximation extending the lower limit of integration from X of minus B to the U.

582
00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:55.680
David Schaich (he): X. And minus infinity. we can pick up a 2 fifth from the integration by parts we are. How are you? I'm sorry. TV is now because the 3,

583
00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:58.500
David Schaich (he): that's all

584
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:03.030
David Schaich (he): I have Sorry you the bypass comes in.

585
00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.740
David Schaich (he): We desire

586
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:13.530
David Schaich (he): the same ratio of exponentials that we got from the you, integrating by parts

587
00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:16.540
David Schaich (he): the derivative of the family function

588
00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:20.500
David Schaich (he): the next, and that just is.

589
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.330
David Schaich (he): or

590
00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:26.220
David Schaich (he): the particle number we expand. This

591
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:30.070
David Schaich (he): function of E itself is a function of x

592
00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:34.640
David Schaich (he): around it X equals 0,

593
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.250
David Schaich (he): and we get from that the same

594
00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:41.710
David Schaich (he): set of phones.

595
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.860
David Schaich (he): Now what it

596
00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:52.880
David Schaich (he): and the integral I 0 that integrates over E to the x.

597
00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:58.630
David Schaich (he): you to the x squared plus one sorry over E to the x plus one squared by itself.

598
00:56:59.910 --> 00:57:01.990
David Schaich (he): The next term

599
00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:08.990
David Schaich (he): in the field or expand expansion brings down a factor of 5 path from the derivative cancels. The 2 fits.

600
00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:15.850
David Schaich (he): There's a factor of team you to the 3 halves and a factor of X coming with the T.

601
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:18.770
David Schaich (he): It gives us need to grow, I one.

602
00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:28.470
David Schaich (he): And then what do you A. T squared. What have

603
00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:41.200
David Schaich (he): the I 2 just barely fits from the X squared. coming along with that issue of exponentials and the constant factor we have out Here is one half of the Taylor expansion.

604
00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:54.600
David Schaich (he): the two-fifths and 5 halves cancel we have it here 3 halves from the second derivative of the 5 has so it's 3 over 2 times 2

605
00:57:54.960 --> 00:58:05.490
David Schaich (he): gives us 3 quarters there. and these are the same integrals that we had before one 0 and high square over 3.

606
00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:09.420
David Schaich (he): So you're not we.

607
00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:15.040
David Schaich (he): My final result in the internal energy.

608
00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.160
David Schaich (he): Yes.

609
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:22.060
David Schaich (he): books quite similar to

610
00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:28.340
David Schaich (he): just a minute to go for the particle number, you know. Walk back, group g, 0, and then

611
00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:33.730
David Schaich (he): in terms, the first independence of team assisting in the limit of absolute 0,

612
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:46.500
David Schaich (he): the second quadratic in just with completely different numerical coefficients. and the however you raised by one from 3 hands to 5 half.

613
00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:50.420
David Schaich (he): you know. For a moment I have to.

614
00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:59.700
David Schaich (he): thanks to having and you to the 3 halves and our starting points rather than just the square root of the

615
00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:05.650
David Schaich (he): and plugging in G 0 Again.

616
00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:08.890
David Schaich (he): we have

617
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:14.400
David Schaich (he): something that is not on the screen at the moment.

618
00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:23.150
David Schaich (he): That's 3 3, half times 2 fits. The two's cancel they're left with refits

619
00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:38.590
David Schaich (he): you to the 5 house over the fairly energy to the rehabs. and then we second term we have 3.

620
00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:43.270
David Schaich (he): It's 3, 8. I forgot the

621
00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:48.830
David Schaich (he): typical number that is in the numerator of G 0.

622
00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.160
David Schaich (he): We'll make sure to

623
00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:56.670
David Schaich (he): that. That Are there

624
00:59:58.170 --> 01:00:01.360
David Schaich (he): pi squared t squared, and then

625
01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.330
David Schaich (he): use the one half power.

626
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:06.600
David Schaich (he): the 3 house.

627
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:12.560
David Schaich (he): Now

628
01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.110
David Schaich (he): what we just found

629
01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.040
David Schaich (he): at the end of

630
01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:22.510
David Schaich (he): our consideration of the particle number was.

631
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.410
David Schaich (he): Yeah. relation between the and the fermi energy that we can use to

632
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.570
David Schaich (he): simplify these 2 terms.

633
01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:41.700
David Schaich (he): and in particular we saw that use the £5 is going to start off. The leading factor of

634
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:46.910
David Schaich (he): the primary energy of the I have with a t square is dependent correction.

635
01:00:48.310 --> 01:00:49.060
David Schaich (he): So

636
01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:51.880
David Schaich (he): just to write this down

637
01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.510
David Schaich (he): explicitly.

638
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:57.720
David Schaich (he): you default has

639
01:00:58.170 --> 01:01:01.220
David Schaich (he): is the fairly energy to the 5 hands times

640
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:06.130
David Schaich (he): this one that is pi squared over 12.

641
01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:08.520
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

642
01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:14.720
David Schaich (he): squared it all of that to the 5 halves

643
01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.250
David Schaich (he): as before.

644
01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:22.450
David Schaich (he): working with low temperatures relative to the pyramid energy, we can expand

645
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:28.500
David Schaich (he): this difference in 1 one is a small quantity to power. It's one minus that 100 times this. Multiply

646
01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:37.780
David Schaich (he): too many order no higher terms of the and neglect, because they will have higher hours of the to be able.

647
01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:45.030
David Schaich (he): We respond to the higher orders in this some of the expansion. The first term is just

648
01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:53.960
David Schaich (he): the and then we have once what else? Times 5 have is 5, 24.

649
01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:58.710
David Schaich (he): The pi squared t squared. and then

650
01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:04.410
David Schaich (he): e to the 5 halves over e squared needs just

651
01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.330
David Schaich (he): one half factor called that to the energy.

652
01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:13.010
David Schaich (he): What you can

653
01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:28.320
David Schaich (he): insert this relation between the chemical potential view and the into the 2 terms that we found for the

654
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:30.530
David Schaich (he): average internal energy

655
01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:35.070
David Schaich (he): this gives us.

656
01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:41.880
David Schaich (he): There you go with the Don't. Need it

657
01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.680
David Schaich (he): clear dependence on the chemical potential.

658
01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:51.590
David Schaich (he): We replace you me this

659
01:02:52.490 --> 01:03:00.210
David Schaich (he): expression in terms of the energy keeping only how it is up to e squared.

660
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:03.990
David Schaich (he): He was on the call expansion. So in this

661
01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:13.980
David Schaich (he): there's personal number I almost forgot about. and then use the 5 apps

662
01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:23.130
David Schaich (he): to the 3 houses just one.

663
01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:26.260
David Schaich (he): If we

664
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:42.340
David Schaich (he): then bring in the second term we have 3 fifths times 5, 24 is the minus sign. and these yeah, we same, and as before.

665
01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:47.480
David Schaich (he): And then I squared T squared

666
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:58.420
David Schaich (he): and turn the energy to the one hand over to the 3 houses. one over. If you any energy there.

667
01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:03.350
David Schaich (he): we need to play the same game with the second term we have up here

668
01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:16.930
David Schaich (he): which brings in a new to the one half. I'll leave you Terrible Here will be the to. You want to have it along with a P squared correction that would come in, and we're a team before.

669
01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:24.720
David Schaich (he): so we'll collect that and keep all of these you can t squared term. We have a plus 3 8

670
01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:31.690
David Schaich (he): critical number I was. I squared t squared, and then

671
01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:36.050
David Schaich (he): very energies for one half over 3 halves again.

672
01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:38.650
David Schaich (he): one over the fermi energy itself

673
01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:52.840
David Schaich (he): good, and the exact quality there. My tap that we have in order to the fourth terms that we are we collecting in these approximations? So all that we have in the end.

674
01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:06.400
David Schaich (he): And you have Toms the German energy the result that we saw in lecture the non-zero internal energy that remains, even though the limit of absolutely 0 temperature.

675
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:22.290
David Schaich (he): and then the leading to, and then correction through that the whole functional form of these 2 terms has come up to be the same. You just have to combine their coefficients 3. It's minus one. A is a quarter. They cost me a selling.

676
01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:31.950
David Schaich (he): and this particle number almost t square over the energy.

677
01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:42.030
David Schaich (he): and therefore keep capacity that we promise to look at the starts of this Pencast

678
01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:50.020
David Schaich (he): Is that constant volume, just the derivative with respect to temperature.

679
01:05:52.150 --> 01:06:01.330
David Schaich (he): The result we just found on the internal energy Fix the total number in the volume. The first term is T. Independent. It drops out.

680
01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:03.260
Yeah.

681
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:15.090
David Schaich (he): i'll put in the approximation sign because i'm dropping this higher order before terms. We have the derivative of t script with respect to T.

682
01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:20.960
Now under there.

683
01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.040
David Schaich (he): Yeah, and

684
01:06:26.610 --> 01:06:33.900
David Schaich (he): times T: And this linear keep capacity in the temperature

685
01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:36.310
David Schaich (he): is just what we looked at

686
01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:38.360
David Schaich (he): in the tutorial.

687
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:44.170
David Schaich (he): We were able to reproduce the functional form a bit more quickly by the collecting

688
01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:46.830
David Schaich (he): all of the awesome factories.

689
01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:54.340
David Schaich (he): So you know, reproduce that work, and in addition to that, we have

690
01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:03.050
David Schaich (he): the results for that far. We heard Helen previously that any

691
01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:08.880
David Schaich (he): you know scene is just. I square over a few times.

692
01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:11.620
David Schaich (he): fixed powerful number

693
01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:18.820
David Schaich (he): over the fermi energy. which is, in fact, a way to

694
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:22.810
David Schaich (he): determined that the family energy of

695
01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.660
David Schaich (he): the source of materials.

696
01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:38.350
David Schaich (he): just by computing the so of, or in this case, the intercept of the heat capacity as popped in this way. Heat capacity over temperature.

697
01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:45.140
David Schaich (he): I guess the temperature squared and intercept is our a. We have now related to the fermi energy

698
01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:57.570
David Schaich (he): with a vacuum of pi squared over 2. So this is one way to use those experimental measurements. the fundamental.

699
01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.020
David Schaich (he): This is your mechanics.

700
01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:06.860
David Schaich (he): all of the electron gas

701
01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:15.310
David Schaich (he): that is giving us that heat capacity. In the in the first place, the theoretical description of the experimental data.

702
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:19.790
David Schaich (he): So that is the

703
01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:26.950
David Schaich (he): final argument that we wanted to reach. Just say one last thing

704
01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:36.010
David Schaich (he): about what happens when that zoom call expansion may not be applicable and may reform

705
01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:43.040
David Schaich (he): I only mark to look at is what happens if we

706
01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.689
David Schaich (he): consider higher temperatures. Yeah, all right.

707
01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:59.200
David Schaich (he): So our full expansion, we can see, is roughly setting this scale relative to which the temperature is hi or low.

708
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:02.130
David Schaich (he): So

709
01:09:04.069 --> 01:09:05.779
David Schaich (he): the expansions that

710
01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:15.859
David Schaich (he): we have going through the effort of computing the expansions and powers.

711
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:27.490
David Schaich (he): Oh. that ratio that it is much less than one, but not 0 good expansions.

712
01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.810
David Schaich (he): not even to the bridge.

713
01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.710
David Schaich (he): If we start to consider high temperatures

714
01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:42.800
David Schaich (he): which we would like to connect to the classical limit

715
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:49.319
David Schaich (he): and see that the chemical potential behaves as we expected, the classical limits

716
01:09:49.529 --> 01:09:55.120
David Schaich (he): of the so. If we don't have expansions.

717
01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:58.550
David Schaich (he): We can't compute the integrals exactly

718
01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:01.980
David Schaich (he): as usual for this module.

719
01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:06.370
David Schaich (he): The modern technology that we were into there is

720
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:09.230
David Schaich (he): a numerical solution

721
01:10:14.770 --> 01:10:17.630
David Schaich (he): of the expression that was our starting point.

722
01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:21.350
David Schaich (he): Hmm. How much particle number

723
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:26.040
David Schaich (he): expressed in terms of the and

724
01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:30.340
David Schaich (he): that we function right now, explicitly

725
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.450
David Schaich (he): as a reminder.

726
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.970
David Schaich (he): and that

727
01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:40.600
David Schaich (he): we can see by plugging in the

728
01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.580
David Schaich (he): result we found for

729
01:10:46.800 --> 01:11:00.780
David Schaich (he): cost in terms of this new States in terms of the particle over and the energy. and he is. we have number over energy to the 3 half power.

730
01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.690
David Schaich (he): So the

731
01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:23.720
David Schaich (he): dependence on the average person number cancels out. and we really have a consistency condition. We just have. say, a one

732
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:36.790
David Schaich (he): on the left side of this equation. and we want that to be equal to this integral. which better have no dimensions. It.

733
01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:44.090
David Schaich (he): my number. We can confirm this by expressing it in terms of

734
01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:47.250
David Schaich (he): to mention this ratios

735
01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:48.990
convenient to

736
01:11:49.090 --> 01:11:59.950
David Schaich (he): work with on the computer. There are new variable X. Will no longer be that difference between energy and chemical potential. So this is

737
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:04.870
David Schaich (he): a new ratio energy that's being integrated over.

738
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:07.370
David Schaich (he): divided by that temperature

739
01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:08.410
the other way

740
01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.610
David Schaich (he): the energy is x times the temperature.

741
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:26.670
David Schaich (he): So if we look at the structure of this expression. we have an integral over now. Dx. The dimensionless number.

742
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:28.200
David Schaich (he): the

743
01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:34.530
David Schaich (he): the E and square root e will bring in the free fact. 3 halves, factors of T.

744
01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:37.550
David Schaich (he): We have 3 hash factors of

745
01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:46.620
David Schaich (he): out front already. So that's another dimension, this ratio. the one that is no longer a small.

746
01:12:50.010 --> 01:13:00.640
David Schaich (he): When he is 0, so is X, and you will be at the upper limit of integration. and we have the you square root of X times you to the

747
01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:04.150
David Schaich (he): Beta times. E is just x.

748
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:08.060
David Schaich (he): We have another factor of the

749
01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:13.850
David Schaich (he): the exponential minus new times. Beta is minus over T,

750
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:19.130
David Schaich (he): and then plus one. Okay.

751
01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:27.970
David Schaich (he): when we integrate X from 0 to infinity, and they want to do this Numerically

752
01:13:28.330 --> 01:13:35.600
David Schaich (he): we made well, went into difficulties with taking the exponential of a very large number.

753
01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:38.770
David Schaich (he): So I trick that we can right here

754
01:13:40.530 --> 01:13:47.990
David Schaich (he): first of all is to define this ratio of temperature over 30 energy to be another dimension, this ratio

755
01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:53.300
David Schaich (he): in lower case to the 3 house power.

756
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:57.970
David Schaich (he): and we can device through by E to the X

757
01:13:59.410 --> 01:14:02.860
David Schaich (he): to give us an integr in this form.

758
01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:13.430
David Schaich (he): We are now these E to the minus x are going to be very small. and save

759
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:16.740
David Schaich (he): as X. Becomes

760
01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:23.600
David Schaich (he): very large, so they will drop out and become unemployed, and will cause any trouble for a miracle evaluation.

761
01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.340
David Schaich (he): And in here

762
01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:33.020
David Schaich (he): I have written this exponential with minus mu over t. It's the ratio of

763
01:14:33.190 --> 01:14:45.640
David Schaich (he): mention. This ratios do you have dividing through my T, which is the temperature over the pyramid energy. so the C. Had better have It's

764
01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:49.150
David Schaich (he): It's so.

765
01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.440
David Schaich (he): You can read all that see is just

766
01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:56.230
David Schaich (he): chemical potential, new over that very energy.

767
01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:59.870
David Schaich (he): and we want to

768
01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:06.170
David Schaich (he): see whether this ratio, which now just involves purely dimensionless numbers.

769
01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:13.880
David Schaich (he): is equal to one for particular values of the and

770
01:15:13.930 --> 01:15:19.490
David Schaich (he): chemical potential, and the temperature, both with respect to the energy.

771
01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:25.290
David Schaich (he): So what we can do for this is fix the value of team

772
01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:31.190
David Schaich (he): to some number that is, of interest, say one the temperature is equal to.

773
01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:35.970
David Schaich (he): If you have any energy or half or 2, and then

774
01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:53.550
David Schaich (he): yeah. be the integral into. I don't to eliminate it. and you can repeatedly evaluate that into goal.

775
01:15:54.010 --> 01:16:02.630
David Schaich (he): Wow! Adjusting our remaining degree of freedom, c. The ratio of chemical

776
01:16:04.730 --> 01:16:10.150
David Schaich (he): in order to satisfy it. The consistency condition

777
01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.380
David Schaich (he): about it.

778
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:18.840
David Schaich (he): That's

779
01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:29.150
David Schaich (he): the integral times 3 has to the 3. Half power is, in fact, equal to what? Just to show off what this could look like.

780
01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:31.340
David Schaich (he): Here is.

781
01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.010
David Schaich (he): hey?

782
01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:41.710
David Schaich (he): It's also in the repository for the module.

783
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:50.880
David Schaich (he): and it does just what I described. It integrates an integrand that is, the square root of X times E to the minus x.

784
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:54.820
David Schaich (he): Divided by this constant factor that depends on

785
01:16:54.940 --> 01:17:01.260
David Schaich (he): C and T. That we choose at the start. plus e to the minus X again.

786
01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:04.540
David Schaich (he): and then we check to see what it 3 halves

787
01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.990
David Schaich (he): times t to the 3 half power

788
01:17:08.850 --> 01:17:19.140
David Schaich (he): multiplying that integral his, or is not equal to the one that it should be the number one.

789
01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:28.520
David Schaich (he): So we choose some T. Here, too. We adjust the C. And we check to see how close we get

790
01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:29.460
David Schaich (he): so

791
01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:43.950
David Schaich (he): fixing the temperature to be twice the fermi energy. the value of the C that is minus 2.4, 6. So a negative value for the chemical potential.

792
01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:52.770
David Schaich (he): That is, 2 and a half times the fermi energy gives us something that is within one per mill of the one of the

793
01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:58.340
David Schaich (he): result that we need to be consistent. We are off by point, 0 0 0 6,

794
01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.390
David Schaich (he): and we can check to see that both sides

795
01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:13.710
David Schaich (he): of 2.4, 6 are far away. so we have 2 point minus 2.4. We are too high by point, 0 3, so that 3 off.

796
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:17.730
David Schaich (he): if we have 2.5. If the negative sign.

797
01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:21.170
David Schaich (he): we are off by 1 point.

798
01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:25.390
David Schaich (he): 8 down at the point 9, 8,

799
01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:38.490
David Schaich (he): so point 4, 6, just working to 2 significant figures after decimal points gives us a good agreement with that self-consistency condition

800
01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:44.810
David Schaich (he): that we can just record it repeat that process for a function of different values of the temperature

801
01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:49.410
David Schaich (he): ranging from one tenth the fermi energy twice the Fermi energy

802
01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:55.190
David Schaich (he): and plot results. and compare them to the

803
01:18:55.250 --> 01:19:00.000
David Schaich (he): leading orders on our field expansion that we computed a few minutes ago

804
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:06.910
David Schaich (he): that this one is

805
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:15.160
David Schaich (he): So what what we are plotting here is that ratio of

806
01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:23.260
David Schaich (he): you over to the app. and we computer earlier on. So that we are comparing this to

807
01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.280
David Schaich (he): is this expression: Here

808
01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:34.510
David Schaich (he): you over to the app is one minus pi over 12 times that to mention this lowercase t

809
01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:41.300
David Schaich (he): so pi squared over 12 times t squared over Germany energy squared.

810
01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:46.140
David Schaich (he): and the y-axis here is the value of

811
01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:48.230
David Schaich (he): See you.

812
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:50.490
David Schaich (he): So the

813
01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:56.270
David Schaich (he): ratio of chemical potential. With respect to the fermi energy that satisfies the

814
01:19:56.670 --> 01:19:57.750
David Schaich (he): exact

815
01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:05.690
David Schaich (he): consistency condition we are evaluating numerically, that is, the red points compared to the leading orders are held. Expansion

816
01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:15.060
David Schaich (he): given by the dashed green line. so we can see. Let me shipped back to Dotcam.

817
01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:17.830
David Schaich (he): which

818
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.890
David Schaich (he): is here.

819
01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:23.550
David Schaich (he): This is that plot

820
01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:37.590
David Schaich (he): to the right place. Coming from a numerical solution that does not make any assumptions about having a low temperature. We can see that the red points and the low temperatures over the expansion from the side.

821
01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:51.760
David Schaich (he): The temperature is small. 1.2. By the time the temperature is comparable to the fermi energy around one. You are standard deviation between

822
01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:54.640
David Schaich (he): the Red X's and the green line.

823
01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:58.660
David Schaich (he): though that leading order expression is not so bad

824
01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:07.120
David Schaich (he): all the way up to temperatures of place that we energy. But the interesting thing about this plot

825
01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:10.070
David Schaich (he): is how you

826
01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:14.570
David Schaich (he): becomes negative as the temperature

827
01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:17.540
David Schaich (he): approaches and exceeds the pyramid energy

828
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:22.110
David Schaich (he): which should remind us of the high temperature classical limits.

829
01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.740
David Schaich (he): You want to reproduce

830
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:31.200
David Schaich (he): you back to you. Already have reproduced this. You've seen that as the temperature increases

831
01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:35.220
David Schaich (he): the chemical potential

832
01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:50.210
David Schaich (he): not only switches from problems to negative. but it becomes more negative, more quickly than the temperature increases. We saw in the code that the 10 years twice the family energy.

833
01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:56.110
David Schaich (he): the chemical potential, was almost 2.5 times the the negative sign.

834
01:21:57.030 --> 01:22:02.720
David Schaich (he): So we have sure that we all approaching

835
01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:15.900
David Schaich (he): the correct classical limit as desired negative, chemical, potential. It's more than the temperature. which is larger than the energy scales of the problem.

836
01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:19.220
David Schaich (he): and that is be here.

837
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:22.190
David Schaich (he): Finally, one

838
01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:27.410
David Schaich (he): results to be a on it. both for

839
01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:41.920
David Schaich (he): investigation, looking beyond very low temperature limits with Malcolm, and it's a confirming on gases approximating the step function approximately. The primary function is a step function we've got beyond that

840
01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:48.210
David Schaich (he): of the summer call expansion. We got a few nice results for the key capacity. and then

841
01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:53.510
David Schaich (he): the chemical potential. And now, numerically, you know, see

842
01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:54.530
David Schaich (he): that

843
01:22:55.380 --> 01:23:00.430
David Schaich (he): the chemical potential behaves as it should reproduce the classical limit

844
01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:05.180
David Schaich (he): that we want. That is it great results to?

845
01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:08.340
David Schaich (he): And this Pencast and the module.
