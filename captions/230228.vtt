1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.230
David Schaich (he): All right, we have a few folks online and a few in the room, so we may as well get underway.  It's Tuesday afternoon, just about at the end of February, and also just about the

2
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.380
David Schaich (he): deadline for the homework assignment, which I suspect some other folks

3
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.180
David Schaich (he): are off working on.

4
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.610
David Schaich (he): Before I forget, here is the

5
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.910
David Schaich (he): 6-digit code for today.

6
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.010
First let me get

7
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.330
David Schaich (he): the focus fixed there...

8
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.170
David Schaich (he): 7, 1, 6,

9
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.970
David Schaich (he): 0, 9, 9.

10
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.690
David Schaich (he): I'll put it on the board as well, in case

11
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.160
anyone

12
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.850
David Schaich (he): arrives a bit late.

13
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.890
David Schaich (he): And, what we've been doing---

14
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.700
David Schaich (he): Well, before we get into what we've been doing, are there any immediate questions about

15
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.430
David Schaich (he): yesterday's lecture, the homework, or

16
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.650
David Schaich (he): other aspects of statistical physics?

17
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.910
David Schaich (he): You are

18
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.510
David Schaich (he): at the moment deep into applications

19
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:29.010
David Schaich (he): of the second main statistical.

20
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.020
David Schaich (he): Look at in this module. and yesterday we

21
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:45.740
David Schaich (he): went through the example of I'm. Hearing it. Canonical ensemble analyses of system so distinguishable

22
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.460
David Schaich (he): from that

23
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.880
David Schaich (he): observable physical effects that depended

24
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.190
David Schaich (he): only on the

25
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.400
David Schaich (he): intrinsic information content of these 2 different types of systems.

26
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.620
David Schaich (he): and we went on from there to

27
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.890
David Schaich (he): turn to the next topic of

28
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.090
little gases.

29
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.180
David Schaich (he): and specifically

30
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.090
David Schaich (he): through the economical ensemble. So

31
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.500
David Schaich (he): it starts with

32
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.040
David Schaich (he): some of

33
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.400
that. We.

34
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.060
David Schaich (he): It could be just a simple cubic box.

35
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.000
David Schaich (he): hey?

36
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.140
David Schaich (he): In all of these analyses for the 2 different types of spin systems

37
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.270
David Schaich (he): with different information, content as well as these high your gases. The procedure has been the same.

38
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.040
The high level

39
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.440
David Schaich (he): start with the fundamental

40
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.980
David Schaich (he): partition function.

41
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.940
David Schaich (he): It's just the repackaging of that partition portion.

42
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:24.350
David Schaich (he): This is based on something over all of the microstate scale of the information about the energy, all each particle in the system.

43
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.220
David Schaich (he): and from partition, functional free energy which you derive.

44
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.790
David Schaich (he): We we are focusing on the internal energy of the many particle system.

45
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.460
expectation, value

46
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:52.900
David Schaich (he): of B, which is no longer concerned for microstate to microstates and economical approach to temperature is Instead, it'll fixed on the external. And we're also interested in the

47
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.820
David Schaich (he): as which is a measure of the information content of the system. So

48
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:13.930
David Schaich (he): just picking up with the ideal gas systems that we started talking about yesterday. So long as there are no questions inspired by this. we review.

49
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.000
David Schaich (he): We have a fixed number of n particles

50
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.230
David Schaich (he): in our system we can find 2. This

51
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.280
David Schaich (he): you say, that boxes

52
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.190
on team.

53
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.010
David Schaich (he): It's fixed. It's your tea through a thermal contact with it. It's surrounding a large reservoir

54
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.040
David Schaich (he): each of the end particles in the system. Is it some position in this box with?

55
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.760
David Schaich (he): So we'll make some 3 vector. It.

56
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.830
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

57
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:56.750
David Schaich (he): As time passes, these particles are bouncing around, adopting all of these different possible microstates with probabilities dictated by the it gives distribution.

58
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.000
David Schaich (he): and from this we want to analyze the partition function and use that to

59
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:15.260
David Schaich (he): provide a zoom room properly. Use of a large scale macroscopic system of with particles using the tools we've developed.

60
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.280
David Schaich (he): How are you

61
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.520
David Schaich (he): probably considered yesterday is the clash between

62
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.760
David Schaich (he): the continuous energies that we having to set up from the continuous

63
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.770
David Schaich (he): moments of he, of all the end particles.

64
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:52.170
David Schaich (he): and figuring out how to incorporate continuously, varying all of these into a position function that is the

65
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.970
David Schaich (he): over microstates.

66
00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:02.660
David Schaich (he): The Boltzmann factor, the exponential of the minus energy of each microstate divided by T, we have to be able to

67
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:09.650
David Schaich (he): enumerate the microstates in order to sum over them in this way. but if they are continuous, and they are accountable.

68
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.870
David Schaich (he): So the strategy, what we only got halfway through yesterday

69
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:22.330
David Schaich (he): use It's called regularization, or just regulating the system.

70
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.620
David Schaich (he): This gives us. Yeah, you know.

71
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.320
David Schaich (he): comfortable 7 micro states

72
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.990
David Schaich (he): which we can then sum over to get the function. and then

73
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.080
David Schaich (he): we get back to we use continuous

74
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.670
David Schaich (he): moment to. I, considering the limits in which.

75
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.380
David Schaich (he): in that partition function.

76
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.850
David Schaich (he): it's really very continuous integrations.

77
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.700
David Schaich (he): So, in particular, the regulation that

78
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.060
David Schaich (he): you host is

79
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.830
David Schaich (he): just an odds. I suggest for what the moment in the system can be.

80
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:27.190
David Schaich (he): You mentioned that it's motivated by quantum mechanics, but it doesn't actually involve any quantum mechanics as well. It's just a way to make them out.

81
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.720
David Schaich (he): Come out in a manageable way.

82
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.400
David Schaich (he): We propose that.

83
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:41.190
David Schaich (he): and only take certain discrete values that depends on

84
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:56.280
David Schaich (he): linear size of the volume in which the particles are bouncing around. So pi over L. This factor of H. Bar, the find constants doing the unit conversion from inverse lengths to momentum.

85
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.460
David Schaich (he): and then you

86
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.120
David Schaich (he): 3 components of the momentum

87
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.430
David Schaich (he): or just replaced by

88
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.220
David Schaich (he): 3 non-negative integers she execute like, he said.

89
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.190
David Schaich (he): I can start at 0 and we're off to.

90
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:19.610
David Schaich (he): And we ended yesterday by checking out the

91
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.520
David Schaich (he): the

92
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.790
David Schaich (he): yeah, the

93
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.020
David Schaich (he): energy for each particle.

94
00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.570
David Schaich (he): the inner product, probably

95
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:37.549
David Schaich (he): he

96
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.809
David Schaich (he): that squares the H bar

97
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:53.130
David Schaich (he): in the in the product of this. Okay, X squared

98
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.550
David Schaich (he): Q. Y squared.

99
00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.770
David Schaich (he): We can also call.

100
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.080
David Schaich (he): Let's see, you know, for our K Square of that 3, vector

101
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.260
David Schaich (he): and we saw that

102
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.430
David Schaich (he): these discrete energy levels are

103
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.510
David Schaich (he): not quick, the same

104
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.310
David Schaich (he): as those

105
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.490
David Schaich (he): previously.

106
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.700
David Schaich (he): because these energies okay.

107
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.530
David Schaich (he): they're not evenly spaced

108
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.510
David Schaich (he): as Katie berries.

109
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:47.390
David Schaich (he): That's just due to the fact that they are bringing in 3 factors of these

110
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.090
David Schaich (he): non-negative integers square, so, for example.

111
00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.440
David Schaich (he): in this expression.

112
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.540
David Schaich (he): involving that it's the number 2 squared

113
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.530
David Schaich (he): possible values that can take our limited

114
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.040
David Schaich (he): if we want the K squared of 6,

115
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:21.250
David Schaich (he): the we just have to have this integer. Vector K. You. This is 2, 1, one for any permutations. Oh, for that! So squaring! Each of those, adding them gives us one plus one plus 1 6.

116
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.110
David Schaich (he): You can see where we get.

117
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:27.210
We have

118
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:35.950
David Schaich (he): you 2 to 0 vector implementations of that much. There's no way to get

119
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.910
David Schaich (he): the key squared of 7, and there are similar gaps in

120
00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:45.370
David Schaich (he): it's called the spectrum of energies, the set of energy levels. As

121
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.680
David Schaich (he): he's

122
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.270
David Schaich (he): higher values.

123
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:59.370
David Schaich (he): So at this point we have the accountable number of

124
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:04.730
David Schaich (he): possible values for the momenta across the accountable number of possible energies

125
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.150
David Schaich (he): for each particle

126
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.210
David Schaich (he): Use that to

127
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:15.050
David Schaich (he): It's coming. The partition function are starting point for a statistical physical analysis.

128
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:21.390
David Schaich (he): I'm. Summing over all the microstates defined by these momentum and energies.

129
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.920
David Schaich (he): Easiest starting point is

130
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.680
David Schaich (he): so. Look at the

131
00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.960
David Schaich (he): he's first.

132
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.540
David Schaich (he): Not just a single particle

133
00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.410
David Schaich (he): in this box.

134
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.130
David Schaich (he): So we set any one and

135
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.560
David Schaich (he): the partition function. So one for this single particle.

136
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:53.980
Yeah.

137
00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:03.830
David Schaich (he): it's just given by the self over all possible values. Oh, yeah.

138
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:09.490
David Schaich (he): the energy that define the microstates that we have

139
00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.530
David Schaich (he): just to say that we

140
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.790
David Schaich (he): all the yeah. i'll mention 3 vectors

141
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.660
David Schaich (he): exponential

142
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:27.360
David Schaich (he): of the for 2 M. Times T:

143
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.970
David Schaich (he): that negative slide I'm. Looking at

144
00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.510
David Schaich (he): on the screen.

145
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.710
David Schaich (he): Vectors K. For each component of K

146
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.590
David Schaich (he): from 0 to infinity.

147
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.390
David Schaich (he): This is your steps, this exponential.

148
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.550
David Schaich (he): because that same factor, minus each

149
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.600
David Schaich (he): L squared

150
00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:03.870
David Schaich (he): times that some of the squares 2 y squared. Is it squared just purely

151
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.720
David Schaich (he): there.

152
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.650
David Schaich (he): and we can immediately start simplifying this.

153
00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.390
David Schaich (he): just by noting that.

154
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.350
David Schaich (he): dividing this some

155
00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.500
David Schaich (he): into

156
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:30.010
David Schaich (he): factorizing this initial factor across that sum, we have an exponential of 3 terms in the sum which we can convert to a product of 3 exponentials.

157
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:36.340
David Schaich (he): Each of those exponentials depends on a different variable, each being summed from 0 to infinity.

158
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.920
David Schaich (he): Shift back over here just to write down that

159
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.710
need a simplification that we can

160
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.670
David Schaich (he): just write a single one of those.

161
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:55.230
David Schaich (he): some of the exponential factors. each

162
00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:01.020
David Schaich (he): 2 in this case the I squared.

163
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.210
David Schaich (he): So that's what we get for

164
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.250
David Schaich (he): That's what we get for.

165
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.960
David Schaich (he): and what we get for.

166
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.680
David Schaich (he): She said it was 3

167
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:20.060
David Schaich (he): different integers. Just give us 3 h of this series of exponential functions.

168
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.640
David Schaich (he): So that's the

169
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.770
David Schaich (he): this success of the first stage of that regularization process.

170
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.300
David Schaich (he): And now

171
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.520
David Schaich (he): you are in a position to

172
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.170
David Schaich (he): get back to you

173
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.310
David Schaich (he): continuous moment in energy by approximating

174
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.250
David Schaich (he): each of these cells.

175
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.390
David Schaich (he): I am in to school.

176
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.500
David Schaich (he): and we do that by considering what exactly is

177
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.070
David Schaich (he): being summed over.

178
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.970
David Schaich (he): So what one thing to

179
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.960
David Schaich (he): appreciate it about this

180
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.540
David Schaich (he): kind of complicated expression Here is

181
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:12.670
David Schaich (he): what our assumptions of the form of this ideal gas

182
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.530
David Schaich (he): imply for

183
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:21.850
David Schaich (he): the different values that we can have for the mass, the temperature, and the length of the box.

184
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.350
David Schaich (he): So we are.

185
00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.700
David Schaich (he): Now I want to more classical guesses.

186
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.240
David Schaich (he): It turns out to me that

187
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.960
David Schaich (he): the temperature is relatively large.

188
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.330
David Schaich (he): and also that the box is relatively large

189
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.520
David Schaich (he): compared to the scales

190
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:46.680
David Schaich (he): set by

191
00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.800
David Schaich (he): it's cost of that unit conversion factor which

192
00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.100
David Schaich (he): tells us

193
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.910
David Schaich (he): when we have to worry about quantum effects at a given length or temperature scale.

194
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.740
David Schaich (he): If the temperature is too low and

195
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:14.180
David Schaich (he): quantum effects will become important, we will see examples of this later on in the module. Similarly, if the box becomes so small that

196
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:21.910
David Schaich (he): these particles, all of it squeezed into a very small area. and basically the system is able to tell.

197
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:29.520
David Schaich (he): quantized and described by wave functions rather than possible for particles.

198
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.060
David Schaich (he): and we will

199
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.950
David Schaich (he): not be able to describe our system in this way. So

200
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:48.500
David Schaich (he): our assumptions I need that those 2 factors are large. We also discussed yesterday that the means that the

201
00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.950
David Schaich (he): mass of the particle is also large.

202
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.700
David Schaich (he): Again, compared to

203
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.260
David Schaich (he): Yeah. My's concept that appears in here, which

204
00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:07.470
David Schaich (he): also it is the scale of relativistic effects.

205
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:16.300
David Schaich (he): All this is to say something we can think is a given it for the guesses. We are analyzing here that the

206
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.310
David Schaich (he): constant factor in this exponential

207
00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:35.520
David Schaich (he): L squared has 3 factors in the denominator, each of which are much larger than a factor in the numerator. So this is a very small

208
00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.520
David Schaich (he): okay to the

209
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:43.110
David Schaich (he): exponential that we have is going to.

210
00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:46.550
David Schaich (he): So what this means?

211
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.070
David Schaich (he): I'm going to

212
00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.630
David Schaich (he): very smoothly at least.

213
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:08.750
David Schaich (he): then a I squared is relatively small.

214
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:23.550
David Schaich (he): So if we have a very small factor multiplying, K. I. Squared and increasing the K. I. Squared by any amount, is going to give us another very small factor. Taking the exponential of that.

215
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:29.030
David Schaich (he): you have to say very small change from one term in this cell to the next.

216
00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:37.960
David Schaich (he): so we can only see where we're driving it. With that we want to get for that, some to an integral, adding up

217
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:44.630
David Schaich (he): an infinite number of I'm going through that quickly because I mentioned it's something you've

218
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:59.180
David Schaich (he): seen many times in many different modules. The one thing we have to worry about is what happens if our into your vector control of the discrete moment it gets very large.

219
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.030
David Schaich (he): So, as each of these K. I

220
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.200
David Schaich (he): go to infinity. What we end up with

221
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:09.570
David Schaich (he): is the exponential factor of an asymptotically large negative number

222
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.710
David Schaich (he): and E to the minus negative. If you.

223
00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.130
David Schaich (he): a large negative number goes to 0.

224
00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:26.420
David Schaich (he): So that is a region we can neglect in this process. and those 2

225
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.320
David Schaich (he): handles give us the confidence to

226
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:37.490
David Schaich (he): approximate this bye. a integral what we lose by doing that are

227
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:42.440
David Schaich (he): manageable terms at large. K. And it's a good approximation.

228
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:51.770
David Schaich (he): Where are you? Exponential contributions are actually not negligible and meaningful.

229
00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:54.170
David Schaich (he): So looking.

230
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:59.570
David Schaich (he): you just add a single one of these sounds that gets queued.

231
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:15.170
David Schaich (he): We can approximate this very well.

232
00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.200
David Schaich (he): My, the continuous integral

233
00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.670
David Schaich (he): over. Say, hey, that is now

234
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:28.280
David Schaich (he): a real number with the same

235
00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.590
David Schaich (he): exponential factor.

236
00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.600
David Schaich (he): This is your kid.

237
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.820
David Schaich (he): and because this expression depends only on the

238
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.010
David Schaich (he): we can

239
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.300
David Schaich (he): switch the domain of it

240
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:53.810
David Schaich (he): from 0 to

241
00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.170
David Schaich (he): exactly minus infinity to infinity.

242
00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.650
David Schaich (he): and a factor of a half to cancel out the 2 identical contributions from

243
00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:05.410
David Schaich (he): hey? He?

244
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:09.380
David Schaich (he): So, hey? That is now the continuous

245
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.040
David Schaich (he): real number

246
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:18.990
David Schaich (he): or negative. just picking up a actually okay.

247
00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.110
David Schaich (he): And the calling that

248
00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:33.980
David Schaich (he): continuous moment when we started off with this piece of I, We're just related to okay this way.

249
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.310
David Schaich (he): You can change your

250
00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:39.490
David Schaich (he): in help with.

251
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.760
David Schaich (he): So that Dk: I is

252
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.770
David Schaich (he): to email comes out from

253
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.160
David Schaich (he): the H of all high. We have a factor of 2,

254
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.500
David Schaich (he): and then integrating it

255
00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.900
David Schaich (he): over the moment it itself. This exponential factor where

256
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:13.250
David Schaich (he): the K. H. Bar pi over L

257
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.950
David Schaich (he): is just you I squared.

258
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:23.630
David Schaich (he): We can recognize this integral as

259
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:29.380
David Schaich (he): the energy over temperature of the Boltzmann factor that we started off with.

260
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:33.690
David Schaich (he): So are there any

261
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:38.770
David Schaich (he): questions or injections to the regularization process that I've

262
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.540
David Schaich (he): are you through with a mixture of

263
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.900
David Schaich (he): calculations and heuristic arguments.

264
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:58.240
David Schaich (he): It's a good thing to you thinking about. See if you can poke any holes into the argument that I was given.

265
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.880
David Schaich (he): This is

266
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.770
David Schaich (he): a legitimate procedure

267
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:10.950
David Schaich (he): going through relatively quickly, and not so formally as

268
00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:23.900
David Schaich (he): some modules might. How great what we are interested in is getting back to the large number of particles that we have for a statistical system.

269
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.130
David Schaich (he): One thing

270
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.430
David Schaich (he): we're only looking here at one of the sums in the single particle

271
00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.070
David Schaich (he): partition function.

272
00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.270
David Schaich (he): all 3,

273
00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.660
David Schaich (he): the 2 pi, h bar you.

274
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:42.730
David Schaich (he): and then

275
00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:48.530
David Schaich (he): integration over the 3 vector moment. So call it a. D. 3 P.

276
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:57.020
David Schaich (he): Just the product of integrations over each independent moment separately. and

277
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.560
the exponential

278
00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.330
Yeah. Just piece clear

279
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:07.620
David Schaich (he): over to Mt. This P. Squared It's good

280
00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.910
David Schaich (he): started off with

281
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:16.650
David Schaich (he): now getting back to. and that

282
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.100
David Schaich (he): independence, and

283
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.080
David Schaich (he): also distinguishable

284
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.660
David Schaich (he): particles.

285
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.600
David Schaich (he): We can

286
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:44.540
David Schaich (he): just immediately write down the partitioned option for indistinguishable particles based on the same arguments that we've used before.

287
00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:49.840
David Schaich (he): or each individual particle in the system. Thank you.

288
00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:53.750
David Schaich (he): I have any value. How the energy with this false, and wait

289
00:24:53.780 --> 00:25:03.040
David Schaich (he): completely independently of what the of the other particles are doing, is not interacting with any of the and not so we can break up

290
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:08.860
David Schaich (he): the partition function of n particles into, and transition functions of a single particle.

291
00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:10.180
David Schaich (he): And then, just

292
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.290
David Schaich (he): all together

293
00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:15.940
David Schaich (he): to get

294
00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.460
David Schaich (he): 3 and factors of

295
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:21.540
David Schaich (he): this

296
00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:27.400
David Schaich (he): 3 and factors of integration.

297
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:41.400
David Schaich (he): and then the exponential factor of this all over all 3 and particles.

298
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:50.250
David Schaich (he): Your product accounts for it.

299
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:59.900
David Schaich (he): 3 of the the some accounts for the factors of N, and then 2 and 2 in the nominator.

300
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:04.520
So.

301
00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:15.830
David Schaich (he): But this is an example of the the factorization that we also solve for the spin systems at the maybe particle notation function is just a large power of

302
00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.790
David Schaich (he): the partition option for a single degree of freedom. What we have here really are

303
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:25.720
David Schaich (he): 3 and completely independence.

304
00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.740
David Schaich (he): So

305
00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:39.110
David Schaich (he): you get a product piece of n squared into each of its 3,

306
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:44.880
David Schaich (he): and each of those Josh integrals integrated over.

307
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:49.430
David Schaich (he): Thank you component for a given particle.

308
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.300
David Schaich (he): How is that component with this

309
00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:59.120
David Schaich (he): factor is something that we have

310
00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.230
David Schaich (he): seen before?

311
00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:15.570
David Schaich (he): It just brings in the factor of the square root of Pi I. The council factor in the denominator of the It's too high. and you

312
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:24.440
David Schaich (he): so combining 3 n hours of 2 pi times the mass times the temperature.

313
00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.930
David Schaich (he): leading it pre-factor

314
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.410
David Schaich (he): the 2 pi in far

315
00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:47.620
David Schaich (he): to the 3 and items 2 pi

316
00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.990
David Schaich (he): 3 and the square root.

317
00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.220
David Schaich (he): We end up with the 2 highest cancelling.

318
00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.310
David Schaich (he): and

319
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:02.160
David Schaich (he): well.

320
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:16.270
David Schaich (he): the you square root of 2 pi in the denominator. Each is not effective at all squared. and also a square.

321
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.520
David Schaich (he): Hello. I'll be there

322
00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:25.120
David Schaich (he): to the 3 N. Over 2 power.

323
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.400
David Schaich (he): Just for convenience.

324
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.570
David Schaich (he): We'll write this in terms of compact

325
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:38.160
David Schaich (he): variable

326
00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:42.540
David Schaich (he): so

327
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:50.260
David Schaich (he): efficient function as this. L. Squared over

328
00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:57.690
David Schaich (he): the name of the cell ph squared. which I notice a function of team

329
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.150
David Schaich (he): over to how it

330
00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.380
David Schaich (he): i'm off the screen

331
00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.440
David Schaich (he): for convenience. I'm just packaging

332
00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:17.090
David Schaich (he): all of these properties of the ideal gas into

333
00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:23.760
David Schaich (he): It's so cool. totally wavelength.

334
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:27.620
David Schaich (he): So we can read all

335
00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.190
David Schaich (he): that Lambda squared

336
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:36.270
David Schaich (he): is 2. Pi hr squared over into so land itself.

337
00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.530
David Schaich (he): Yes.

338
00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.700
David Schaich (he): 2 pi Hr. Squared over Mt.

339
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.230
David Schaich (he): Square root.

340
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.840
David Schaich (he): This is named after

341
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:56.720
David Schaich (he): we definitely who proposed that with a given mass.

342
00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:02.050
David Schaich (he): We're governed by we in this way during the only 100 years ago. Now.

343
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.630
David Schaich (he): historical side

344
00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.840
David Schaich (he): this is.

345
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.090
David Schaich (he): It depends on the temperature.

346
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.490
David Schaich (he): so you have to do it. Now.

347
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:32.610
David Schaich (he): partition function, for in this way

348
00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:38.860
David Schaich (he): what we can do is swap out the elsewhere to the 3 halves, palette, or l cube.

349
00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:43.930
David Schaich (he): which? What's the volume of the container that we started off with?

350
00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.260
David Schaich (he): Similarly, with

351
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.210
David Schaich (he): 3 h.

352
00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.860
David Schaich (he): all of that analysis

353
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:58.570
David Schaich (he): to the end. Power and freehouse have been absorbed

354
00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.060
David Schaich (he): if we can note that

355
00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.290
David Schaich (he): they saw that the conditions we

356
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:20.050
David Schaich (he): and then reviewed just a few minutes ago. We have dealing with the classical, Non- optimistic set of particles. Mt. And L. Are all large compared to H. Bar.

357
00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:22.610
David Schaich (he): So this

358
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:35.430
David Schaich (he): which brings it a large mit in the denominator, the small H bar squared and numerator.

359
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:36.470
David Schaich (he): That must be

360
00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.050
David Schaich (he): much more, much smaller.

361
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.890
David Schaich (he): Then

362
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:43.110
David Schaich (he): the large size of the container

363
00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:46.840
David Schaich (he): here, both sides

364
00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:56.900
David Schaich (he): is much smaller that we have out there.

365
00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:03.110
David Schaich (he): Maybe the you think the notes that was

366
00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:11.930
David Schaich (he): the partition function that we have now found it is that in addition to

367
00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:17.220
David Schaich (he): the number of particles and the temperature that's hiding

368
00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:26.430
David Schaich (he): the partition function actually depends on the volume. If the guest occupies.

369
00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:33.040
David Schaich (he): she said. significant change spin systems.

370
00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.600
David Schaich (he): we haven't, yet totally.

371
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:44.520
David Schaich (he): So that is all right.

372
00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:46.560
David Schaich (he): starting point for

373
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.920
David Schaich (he): computing large scale properties.

374
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:59.270
David Schaich (he): Basically just the information about how the energy of each gas particle depends on this moment.

375
00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:03.610
David Schaich (he): But before we get into that.

376
00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.730
David Schaich (he): It's worth

377
00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.320
David Schaich (he): considering the

378
00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:23.880
David Schaich (he): what would happen if these and particles were indistinguishable. and rather than growing things up live. I took the number to you

379
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.960
David Schaich (he): printing out

380
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:38.350
David Schaich (he): the cartoon that illustrates what we have to worry about. We saw yesterday that distinguishable versus indistinguishable particles behave significantly differently

381
00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:50.040
David Schaich (he): in the case of spin systems. so it's worth currently considering him what happens in an ideal gas depending on whether or not we can distinguish different particles.

382
00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:52.460
David Schaich (he): Now.

383
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:58.050
David Schaich (he): in this context, distinguishing a particle means being able to apply some label to it.

384
00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:02.040
David Schaich (he): saying that this.

385
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:09.500
David Schaich (he): some other particles it will be, and they can tell apart the system where those 2 particles panel

386
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.520
David Schaich (he): the same position in momentum.

387
00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:24.280
David Schaich (he): probably. and otherwise. It's been through microstates. It's all the same positions for each particle, but just a different label. In that case this particle of

388
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:25.840
David Schaich (he): that Obviously it will be

389
00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:35.270
David Schaich (he): distinct microstates that we have to sum over my computing the partition function that we

390
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.750
David Schaich (he): just found.

391
00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:43.179
David Schaich (he): and the industry is working. So we don't have any you labels

392
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.830
David Schaich (he): available to.

393
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:49.949
David Schaich (he): They are the same

394
00:34:52.239 --> 00:35:01.070
David Schaich (he): in terms of their intrinsic information, content in principle, there's no way to label the

395
00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:10.780
David Schaich (he): once it one of these microstates from the other, which is to say that they are, in fact, not different microstates, but the same microscope.

396
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:17.880
David Schaich (he): So in this simple example of 2 particles.

397
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.060
David Schaich (he): each

398
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.040
David Schaich (he): microstate of indistinguishable system

399
00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:35.180
David Schaich (he): corresponded to

400
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:41.330
David Schaich (he): twice as many microstates of the distinguishable system just based on

401
00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.170
David Schaich (he): number of different ways.

402
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:46.430
David Schaich (he): the distinguishable particles to be labeled

403
00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.660
David Schaich (he): so

404
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:57.130
David Schaich (he): half as many micro states

405
00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.560
David Schaich (he): absence of information

406
00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.890
David Schaich (he): about labeling particles.

407
00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.760
David Schaich (he): and it's a

408
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:11.410
David Schaich (he): straightforward calculation to

409
00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.660
David Schaich (he): generalize this sort of argumentation to you.

410
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.550
David Schaich (he): The larger number of particles inside

411
00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.740
David Schaich (he): zoom back into way.

412
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.490
David Schaich (he): larger text size. i'm recording.

413
00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.140
David Schaich (he): So if we take 3 particles.

414
00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.800
David Schaich (he): P. One into

415
00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:42.040
David Schaich (he): 3, 3. Yeah. I will assume that

416
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:47.510
David Schaich (he): all of these moments are distinct and distinguishable.

417
00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:49.560
David Schaich (he): Good shot

418
00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:59.610
David Schaich (he): is a reliable assumption. Again, for the classical, non relativistic. Yes, as we are considering. then

419
00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.400
David Schaich (he): we can all we have to do to connect

420
00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:13.120
David Schaich (he): the distinguishable and indistinguishable cases is count how many ways distinguishable particles.

421
00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:14.530
You can call

422
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:15.610
David Schaich (he): the first one

423
00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.610
a

424
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:18.120
David Schaich (he): this second.

425
00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.140
David Schaich (he): That's a particle B,

426
00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:28.400
David Schaich (he): or just go through all possible permutations. They're up.

427
00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:33.390
David Schaich (he): Let's see

428
00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.050
there you go

429
00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:36.970
David Schaich (he): so

430
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.630
David Schaich (he): for a single

431
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:48.420
David Schaich (he): microstates out there into sensible particles. There are

432
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.310
David Schaich (he): you 6

433
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:56.390
David Schaich (he): microstates?

434
00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.220
If the particles were

435
00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.310
David Schaich (he): distinguishable and

436
00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.650
David Schaich (he): generalizing.

437
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.500
David Schaich (he): see what the head is going to be

438
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:11.900
David Schaich (he): so.

439
00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:22.810
David Schaich (he): In general, the analysis of distinguishable. I don't know NASA's. I want to

440
00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.730
David Schaich (he): all the same

441
00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.460
David Schaich (he): integrals over the

442
00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:38.310
David Schaich (he): and we individual with at the end of our regularization procedure.

443
00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.560
David Schaich (he): But the

444
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.790
David Schaich (he): distinguishable case will introduce

445
00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:51.810
David Schaich (he): in factorial different ways of distinguishing it. each of those integrals

446
00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.620
David Schaich (he): due to the different ways that

447
00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:58.110
David Schaich (he): the end particles can be labor

448
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.250
David Schaich (he): in factory. A few of my States.

449
00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:09.850
David Schaich (he): without access to

450
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.330
David Schaich (he): the additional information that

451
00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.040
David Schaich (he): those labels with her hide

452
00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:21.480
David Schaich (he): she is. it's the long way of saying that the

453
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:32.000
David Schaich (he): is just one over n factorial Times economical partition function

454
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.830
David Schaich (he): that we just computed.

455
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:38.560
David Schaich (he): which itself was.

456
00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:43.060
David Schaich (he): and powers of single particle partition function.

457
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:44.320
David Schaich (he): thanks to

458
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:49.540
David Schaich (he): the factorization that is for these non interacting ideal gases

459
00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:05.310
David Schaich (he): to the power in just to break things out. And then the detail. This is the ratio of the volume

460
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:14.220
David Schaich (he): involved all of the factors of

461
00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.930
David Schaich (he): temperature. legs.

462
00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:27.150
David Schaich (he): unit conversion to you 3 n over 2.

463
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:33.650
David Schaich (he): So that is yeah full expression for

464
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.650
David Schaich (he): the partition function

465
00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:52.390
David Schaich (he): and particles where the information content of distinguished rovers is indistinguishable. Articles only brings in this factor of one over n factorial from enabling

466
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:53.140
David Schaich (he): the

467
00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.700
David Schaich (he): clean energy.

468
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.540
David Schaich (he): My, this

469
00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.350
David Schaich (he): which

470
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:21.500
David Schaich (he): so 2 terms from these 2 factors that want to be one of them.

471
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.910
David Schaich (he): First, we have

472
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:30.100
David Schaich (he): whatever in factorial. It is the negative of the

473
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:41.170
David Schaich (he): There's a 2 more n factorial. and then you can bring down. Yeah, how are to a pre-factor?

474
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:44.600
David Schaich (he): 3 and over 2 times

475
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:46.370
David Schaich (he): negative temperature.

476
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.690
All right

477
00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:51.730
David Schaich (he): of this item here.

478
00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.300
It depends on the mass, temperature and

479
00:41:55.390 --> 00:42:01.240
David Schaich (he): size of the container. It it was the gas yourself.

480
00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:13.420
David Schaich (he): This is all we need in order to

481
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:21.610
David Schaich (he): large scale behavior of these systems. So your first yes.

482
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:30.620
David Schaich (he): the average internal energy. For

483
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:32.090
if I

484
00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:33.700
David Schaich (he): of in particles.

485
00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:36.610
David Schaich (he): hey, Andy

486
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.600
David Schaich (he): in the that

487
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:46.230
David Schaich (he): clear short. Later.

488
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:50.180
David Schaich (he): we have derived that

489
00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.180
David Schaich (he): the average internal energy

490
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:58.230
David Schaich (he): it's related to a simple derivative

491
00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:06.200
David Schaich (he): of the helpful free energy. The inside the derivative of this t squared outside.

492
00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:09.420
David Schaich (he): So if we plug in

493
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.600
David Schaich (he): the help of free energy that we just compute it.

494
00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:27.470
David Schaich (he): you're finding out the T in both of these terms more than 10 factorial, that we don't need to care about in the derivative because it's independent of temperature.

495
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:30.230
David Schaich (he): You will have

496
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:32.720
David Schaich (he): 3 cancel.

497
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:43.350
David Schaich (he): I'm. Z more of the temperature. And then everything else in here is independence

498
00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:48.860
David Schaich (he): out the temperature and just drops out of the derivative

499
00:43:50.610 --> 00:44:02.440
David Schaich (he): so the derivative. Of the team just brings in a one over T, which cancels off one of those 2 powers up there. The negative signs cancel

500
00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.760
David Schaich (he): that the energy is

501
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:11.890
David Schaich (he): just 3 halves times the number of particles times the temperature

502
00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.840
David Schaich (he): wish

503
00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.810
David Schaich (he): you so remarkably simple results

504
00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:21.430
David Schaich (he): given the starting point that we had

505
00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:29.600
David Schaich (he): something over discrete momentum. and it's different particles in 3 dimensions. It's also a simple result

506
00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:33.050
David Schaich (he): and create our temperature.

507
00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.350
David Schaich (he): It's producing

508
00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:39.220
David Schaich (he): a greater internal energy, which is also an extensive quality

509
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:42.070
David Schaich (he): linearly to the number of particles.

510
00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.500
David Schaich (he): and maybe the

511
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:48.920
David Schaich (he): most remarkable context. Most remarkable aspect of this is

512
00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:50.500
David Schaich (he): the way that

513
00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.880
the statistical physics tool that we have

514
00:44:55.080 --> 00:45:02.220
David Schaich (he): to develop this, giving us these very simple macroscopic relations between large scale behavior of

515
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:08.120
David Schaich (he): the just from that starting place. call me

516
00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.500
David Schaich (he): microscopic, for

517
00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:16.420
David Schaich (he): with the energy of a single particle in a

518
00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.500
David Schaich (he): practical.

519
00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:21.450
David Schaich (he): The you

520
00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:32.100
David Schaich (he): entropy is every bit as easy to figure out, because we have the that we've arrived.

521
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.460
David Schaich (he): That's all. My

522
00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:40.540
David Schaich (he): The difference between the internal energy.

523
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:44.440
David Schaich (he): the free energy divided by temperature.

524
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:49.630
David Schaich (he): internal energy over temperature, is just 3 halves. and

525
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.970
David Schaich (he): looking back to the whole world, free energy

526
00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.360
David Schaich (he): back to you.

527
00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:04.660
David Schaich (he): We have with the negative side. plus

528
00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:06.930
David Schaich (he): 3 years.

529
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:13.110
Wait a month squared.

530
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:14.540
David Schaich (he): and then minus.

531
00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:36.010
David Schaich (he): My name is Anne. So subtracting a negative end. Is this an additional factor in coming into that? So 5 years in?

532
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:40.560
David Schaich (he): And if we take this 3 handles. put that back into.

533
00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:48.600
David Schaich (he): You can write this as call queue, which is the

534
00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.150
David Schaich (he): over

535
00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:58.130
David Schaich (he): there.

536
00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:17.790
David Schaich (he): So I really have a time to really make a lot of comments about this. We will we, as a that on the Monday Sorry comparing it

537
00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:22.640
David Schaich (he): how to make some physical intuition out of

538
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:26.430
David Schaich (he): these results for energy and entropy.

539
00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:32.480
David Schaich (he): So what i'll wrap up with today is writing down

540
00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.680
David Schaich (he): similar results.

541
00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:40.590
David Schaich (he): Okay.

542
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:53.490
David Schaich (he): So I so they become clear Why, we first consider the case of indistinguishable particles.

543
00:47:54.090 --> 00:48:01.940
David Schaich (he): That is because the difference between distinguishable and in the sensible particles is just this factor of one over n factorial.

544
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.500
David Schaich (he): So all we need to do in the any call results

545
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:08.960
David Schaich (he): that we just

546
00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.930
David Schaich (he): and get rid of it. Everything involved in that.

547
00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:25.420
David Schaich (he): So we can immediately write down from this expression that they call it free energy. It's not. One has 3

548
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:27.990
David Schaich (he): in the

549
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:31.410
okay.

550
00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:34.140
David Schaich (he): the usual actor.

551
00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.340
David Schaich (he): the internal energy.

552
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:39.060
Okay.

553
00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:45.010
David Schaich (he): It does not change, because that

554
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:48.580
David Schaich (he): in factorial, this temperature independent and drop that

555
00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.720
David Schaich (he): of the driven. I believe.

556
00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:59.500
David Schaich (he): did not have or does not have, that more impact, her real case, which is these 2 terms.

557
00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:04.990
David Schaich (he): Yes.

558
00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:11.180
the T. Hq. So we'll pick up

559
00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:18.370
David Schaich (he): on Monday with some discussion of what these results need now that we've derived from

560
00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:19.860
David Schaich (he): and

561
00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:30.530
David Schaich (he): before then be on a Thursday morning for a tutorial or a few things that we can look at. For instance.

562
00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:33.320
David Schaich (he): seeing how

563
00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:37.480
David Schaich (he): the interview behaves when different systems are combined, something that

564
00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:46.120
David Schaich (he): will also be looking into media lectures next week. and I think it is useful thing to do.

565
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:56.970
David Schaich (he): But we're not. You've seen it before is actually derived. This approximation to the then factorial sterling's formula

566
00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:57.960
David Schaich (he): which

567
00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:02.390
David Schaich (he): can be done in many different ways.

568
00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:04.510
David Schaich (he): questions about what we were able to

569
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:12.250
David Schaich (he): get through today. Writing down the partition function and observing all of these for these 2

570
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:19.590
David Schaich (he): different types of classical ideal gases which i'll start putting to work next week.

571
00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:25.320
David Schaich (he): See you Thursday. You can enjoy not having

572
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:28.580
David Schaich (he): any more work to deal with this module

573
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.280
David Schaich (he): for you. A couple of those.
