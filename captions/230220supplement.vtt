1
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:11.330
David Schaich (he): So, keen readers of the lecture notes will have noticed that on the twentieth of February we skipped over an example,

2
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.630
David Schaich (he): that

3
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:21.590
David Schaich (he): I think started this life as a tutorial activity. We haven't had tutorials for a few weeks either, but it might be interesting to go through with this

4
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.710
David Schaich (he): hopefully quick, supplemental Pencast.  To

5
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:39.310
David Schaich (he): both talk a bit about negative temperatures, which come up on that first homework assignment to next week, as well as --- probably more importantly --- providing a fun example of the utility of random walks as a modeling tool.

6
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.230
David Schaich (he): So this is a supplement to

7
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.170
David Schaich (he): the lecture on the twentieth of February, where we looked at the

8
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.510
David Schaich (he): definition of temperature in the micro-canonical ensemble.

9
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.390
David Schaich (he): To remind you that the inverse temperature was

10
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.190
David Schaich (he): defined by the response of the

11
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.810
David Schaich (he): entropy to a change in energy evaluated with a fixed number of particles.

12
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:28.150
David Schaich (he): This is in normally thermodynamic equilibrium. so that the entropy can be replaced just by the logarithm of the number of microstates.

13
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.330
David Schaich (he): and we will look at the example

14
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.310
David Schaich (he): of the spin system that was

15
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:50.540
David Schaich (he): introduced last week. We have the the energy it was given by the negative value of the external magnetic field.

16
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.880
David Schaich (he): multiply by twice the number of upward pointing spins that are aligned with that

17
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.620
David Schaich (he): minus the total number of spins

18
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.840
David Schaich (he): just to

19
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.190
David Schaich (he): cool

20
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.140
David Schaich (he): that general illustration. We have an extra one from the page.

21
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.750
David Schaich (he): and then the scans are pointing. either out or down compared to that

22
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.980
these

23
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.450
David Schaich (he): 6 spins have for aligned upwards with the field, contributing negative energy.

24
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.580
David Schaich (he): 2 that are anti align with the field that are contributing positive energy and pointing downward.

25
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.180
Now for each

26
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.380
David Schaich (he): difference that we have.

27
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.030
David Schaich (he): we know, in the micro canonical ensemble the energy is conserved.

28
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.460
David Schaich (he): So for each different value of the we have a different number

29
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.430
David Schaich (he): of upward or down reporting spins with the total fixed.

30
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:16.830
David Schaich (he): And then this different number of corresponding to the different energy will give us a different number of microstates. which then gives us a different entropy.

31
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.090
David Schaich (he): which then gives us a different temperature by our definition.

32
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.600
David Schaich (he): So, just to some quick illustrations

33
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.430
David Schaich (he): for the micro canonical system with the lowest possible energy. In this. In system

34
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.620
David Schaich (he): this occurs when

35
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.310
David Schaich (he): all of the spins are pointing upwards, aligned with that

36
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.870
David Schaich (he): external. If you don't

37
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.840
David Schaich (he): like. So

38
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.710
David Schaich (he): So in this case. and plus is just n

39
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.660
David Schaich (he): and minus 0, and the energy putting things in

40
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.010
David Schaich (he): he is

41
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.950
David Schaich (he): minus N. Times H. So that's the most negative value that the energy can have.

42
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:13.100
David Schaich (he): This is sometimes referred to as the ground states that is, terminology. We will come back to later on in the module.

43
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:28.660
David Schaich (he): The important thing here for the temperature is that the multiplicity of this critical state of the number of microstates with this energy we call that. And as a function of the

44
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:37.950
David Schaich (he): there is just one possible collection of spin orientations that can produce this number of microstates is just this one

45
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.240
David Schaich (he): that changes for the next lowest energy.

46
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.070
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

47
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:57.660
David Schaich (he): okay. policy. Yeah. Video: To think about this for a minute or 2. Hopefully, it's not surprising that

48
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:06.020
David Schaich (he): This is the system where all but one of the spins is pointing up the line with the field. The last one is pointing down.

49
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.270
David Schaich (he): and there are

50
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.360
David Schaich (he): 6 different options. For which of these 6 spins can be the one pointing down.

51
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:28.120
David Schaich (he): So those 2 microstates they both have that same energy with. and plus of N. Minus one single down, recording spin

52
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.560
David Schaich (he): corresponding energy of the

53
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.870
David Schaich (he): then

54
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:47.170
David Schaich (he): N. Minus one factors of minus H plus that single factor of H, which is minus N. Minus 2 H. So still negative, but less negative than

55
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:58.780
David Schaich (he): the ground state and the number of microstates. With this energy one is 6. For this

56
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:12.840
David Schaich (he): case we're in more generally. which we can recognize based on what we actually looked in the house. There's that I've been writing. We can recognize this as

57
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.680
David Schaich (he): coefficient, or end to choose one, and choosing a single spin out of the total end

58
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.900
David Schaich (he): to be allied against the field.

59
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.410
David Schaich (he): So generalizing.

60
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.130
David Schaich (he): based on those 2 simple examples we can

61
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:40.050
David Schaich (he): to find the number of microstates for the energy with some number of downward pointing spins.

62
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.320
David Schaich (he): Just to be and choose that number of

63
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:56.660
David Schaich (he): you should convince yourself that this is also I tend to call to, and choosing the number up and pointing stands. It is just factorial

64
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.130
David Schaich (he): over in plus and minus and plus factorial.

65
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:09.370
David Schaich (he): You can recognize n minus n plus as n minus, and then plus is and minus.

66
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.560
David Schaich (he): Now you get the temperature

67
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.090
David Schaich (he): problem.

68
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.550
David Schaich (he): This number of micro states.

69
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.650
David Schaich (he): We need both to take the derivative of this expression.

70
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:34.280
David Schaich (he): What we do say a lot with the of this expression to get the entropy, and then the derivative

71
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.630
David Schaich (he): of that.

72
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.720
David Schaich (he): So

73
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.360
David Schaich (he): that tells us 2 things. First of all.

74
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.660
David Schaich (he): we need this. and plus

75
00:07:53.260 --> 00:08:02.830
David Schaich (he): in terms of you, can serve qualities that we take the derivative with respect to and end, we will fix. But more importantly.

76
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.600
David Schaich (he): we also need

77
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.310
David Schaich (he): a differentiable

78
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.600
David Schaich (he): approximation

79
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:22.180
David Schaich (he): to these factorial factors, which are not convenience to differentiate

80
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:32.929
David Schaich (he): in the homework assignments We're given what option he's applying formula

81
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.390
David Schaich (he): before that log of your large number is approximately

82
00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:42.350
David Schaich (he): sorry. A large number of factorial

83
00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.730
right, that more clearly

84
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.550
David Schaich (he): the logarithm of the factorial of a large number

85
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:56.630
David Schaich (he): is approximately any more and minus and with higher order corrections. There he is

86
00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:02.330
David Schaich (he): another option. Go through in this podcast.

87
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.440
David Schaich (he): which is to model the

88
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.860
David Schaich (he): It's been a system

89
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.720
David Schaich (he): as a random walk.

90
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.180
David Schaich (he): You know the space of its energies

91
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.340
David Schaich (he): hold it

92
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.350
David Schaich (he): random, walk. energy, space.

93
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:39.530
David Schaich (he): So if we look at these sorts of illustrations and think about how

94
00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:44.240
David Schaich (he): the energy is adding up from each of the spins that are

95
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:49.110
David Schaich (he): at play. In the total system we can interpret. It

96
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.000
David Schaich (he): is a step

97
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:04.550
David Schaich (he): of a fixed length, plus or minus one in a variable x.

98
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.540
David Schaich (he): which is minus C over H,

99
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:13.210
David Schaich (he): which something got it from our starting point in the spin system that we looked at earlier

100
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.600
David Schaich (he): is just

101
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.780
David Schaich (he): 2 and plus minus n.

102
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:26.000
David Schaich (he): So taking steps either to the left or right, or plus, or minus one in energy.

103
00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:33.360
David Schaich (he): is the simple example that we considered when introducing random walks in the lecture.

104
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:34.900
David Schaich (he): So

105
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.830
David Schaich (he): it's. Modeling just reduces to

106
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.750
David Schaich (he): That's simple. On the random walk, for example, with a fixed step plan.

107
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:57.500
David Schaich (he): and in particular, because we are not imposing any preference on whether a spin points up or down. You're just counting them.

108
00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.180
David Schaich (he): Then we

109
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.320
David Schaich (he): stepping up to one, or stepping with minus, one.

110
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.130
David Schaich (he): become the same. Those are just stop both 50%

111
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.640
David Schaich (he): E equals. Q. Equals a half.

112
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:31.630
David Schaich (he): So with this particular set of set of probabilities. oh. 2 to the power in possible walks

113
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.300
David Schaich (he): for each each walk

114
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.220
David Schaich (he): he's really a spin configuration

115
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.990
David Schaich (he): all of them are.

116
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.440
David Schaich (he): and the

117
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:57.290
David Schaich (he): the number of spins with

118
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:09.570
David Schaich (he): and minus downward pointing, so the number of configurations with and not it's down reporting spins. It's just going to be given by

119
00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:15.020
David Schaich (he): the total number of walks times the probability i'll end up with.

120
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.530
David Schaich (he): and by this steps

121
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:18.470
David Schaich (he): a flag.

122
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.490
and my steps minus one.

123
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:27.710
David Schaich (he): and my the steps to the left and the random walk example. which

124
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:36.360
David Schaich (he): we know that that probability itself is just the

125
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.750
David Schaich (he): number of

126
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.350
David Schaich (he): ways

127
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.310
David Schaich (he): of

128
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.010
David Schaich (he): taking and minus out of the end spins

129
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.790
David Schaich (he): in that direction, divided by the total number of spins.

130
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:05.850
David Schaich (he): But now what we have. So this is a

131
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.610
David Schaich (he): essentially rehash of what we had on the previous

132
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:16.810
David Schaich (he): screen. We know that. and of the given energy is the binomial factor.

133
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:21.580
David Schaich (he): We've related that to the total number of spins and the probability for

134
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:31.530
David Schaich (he): the walks with the corresponding number of spins of the proper orientation. The power comes from the central limit theorem.

135
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.910
David Schaich (he): This will allow us to

136
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.870
David Schaich (he): get another expression. For this probability

137
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.520
David Schaich (he): I will actually

138
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.040
David Schaich (he): work with. and plus

139
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.650
David Schaich (he): rather than n minus, just for notational

140
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.940
David Schaich (he): convenience.

141
00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:11.310
David Schaich (he): I'm. With the central limit theorem of gives us for a large number of spins is a probability distribution in this variable X,

142
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:33.410
David Schaich (he): the pre-factor, whatever with 2 pi and Sigma Square, and then the exponential of X minus U squared over 2. And Sigma squared for a single step with P. And Q. Equal

143
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.550
I have.

144
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:45.770
David Schaich (he): You can recall and look out that this was 2 P. Minus one for the simple case of 6 step lights.

145
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:51.610
David Schaich (he): Well, that's 0, as we should expect. If there's an equal probability of stepping way or left.

146
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.640
David Schaich (he): the expectation value is to end up about where we started.

147
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.400
David Schaich (he): and similarly, the variants

148
00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:07.050
David Schaich (he): You' it to be 4 P. Queue, with both P. And Q. And equal to half. That's one.

149
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:17.110
David Schaich (he): So the probability distribution is just one over root, 2 pi n times the exponential of minus X squared

150
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.660
over to.

151
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.620
David Schaich (he): Now, this is the distribution. If we want

152
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:28.220
David Schaich (he): the actual probability for a given number of spins that we need to

153
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:29.650
David Schaich (he): integrate this

154
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:36.250
David Schaich (he): over a suitable range of X values.

155
00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:46.230
David Schaich (he): In the first tutorial that we did have, we looked at the central limit theorem, and saw that

156
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:56.080
David Schaich (he): approximating this distribution as a constant within this range of integration is a good approximation, as the number of

157
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.190
David Schaich (he): steps or the number of spins becomes large.

158
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.820
David Schaich (he): So we will use that here.

159
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.780
David Schaich (he): and we will

160
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.460
David Schaich (he): determine that the range we want to integrate over. So

161
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:26.530
David Schaich (he): It's. P. Constant for a given value, and plus is the value of the

162
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.030
David Schaich (he): probability distribution from the

163
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:40.040
David Schaich (he): my X equal 2 and plus minus 10 times the width of the range

164
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:44.940
David Schaich (he): between this value and plus and the next, and plus it's just counting

165
00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:52.440
David Schaich (he): the number of spins that are pointing up or down that changes by one as we integrated both of that.

166
00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.680
David Schaich (he): And we can. So

167
00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:07.400
David Schaich (he): probably from this Council approximation is just the distribution where we can also recognize that this argument. X. To handle

168
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.890
David Schaich (he): my capital N. Is just

169
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:19.210
David Schaich (he): minus E over H, so that the probability coming from a distribution

170
00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:26.650
David Schaich (he): and ultimately for me central limit theorem and the training of the work. Modeling

171
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.810
David Schaich (he): is an exponential

172
00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.630
David Schaich (he): minus. E squared over 2 N.

173
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.800
H. Squared.

174
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.150
David Schaich (he): and then

175
00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:48.560
David Schaich (he): from the top of the screen we just need a factor of 2 to the N. To connect this probability to the total number of walks.

176
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.850
David Schaich (he): or equally the total number of

177
00:17:52.730 --> 00:18:06.510
David Schaich (he): microstates that have a given value of the energy. This is an approximation that becomes exactly the into infinity limit. And more importantly, it is a

178
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:16.450
David Schaich (he): that is continuous and differentiable. Oh, sure! Oh. the energy! Yeah. the in the particle.

179
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.470
David Schaich (he): So taking the derivative

180
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.530
David Schaich (he): of the water rhythm

181
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.440
David Schaich (he): of them to give us the inverse temperature.

182
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.380
David Schaich (he): Well, the

183
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:42.150
David Schaich (he): property of the law, as always, is going to break up this product of factories into a some of

184
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.240
David Schaich (he): one of those terms is the what name of the exponential of

185
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:55.420
David Schaich (he): minus. E squared over 2 and H squared the log of the exponential is just it's argument.

186
00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:03.040
David Schaich (he): and then everything else is actually independent of the energy. so

187
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.970
David Schaich (he): we can ignore it when it's taking this derivative, and we just end up with

188
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.820
David Schaich (he): minus E over

189
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.610
of 2,

190
00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.650
David Schaich (he): the other one so minus E over and h squared. or

191
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.870
David Schaich (he): the temperature itself.

192
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.430
David Schaich (he): we have found that temperature is

193
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.330
David Schaich (he): approximately with a very good approximation

194
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.400
David Schaich (he): for a large number

195
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.160
David Schaich (he): out of degrees of freedom. It's about minus N. H. Squared over E.

196
00:19:51.420 --> 00:20:01.920
David Schaich (he): So let's just make a few observations or comments about this. You wrap up this fantas before it goes you want

197
00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:04.800
David Schaich (he): that

198
00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:07.840
David Schaich (he): we checked

199
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:13.630
David Schaich (he): in the lecture on the twentieth of that

200
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:27.740
David Schaich (he): temperature, and the micro canonical, unsolvable behaves as we expect when we talk about heat exchange. It leads to a flow of energy from other systems to cover systems, bringing their temperatures into

201
00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.250
David Schaich (he): better agreement.

202
00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:41.020
David Schaich (he): But in this case there are some features of this expression from the temperature that are a bit different than our everyday expectations.

203
00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.340
David Schaich (he): So, for one thing.

204
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:47.030
David Schaich (he): this temperature he comes in for this.

205
00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:53.940
David Schaich (he): If the energy actually goes to 0. So one over e diverges.

206
00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.960
David Schaich (he): and

207
00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:04.110
David Schaich (he): the energy goes to 0 when there are roughly equal numbers for exactly equal numbers of upward and downward, pointing space.

208
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.240
maybe even more surprising.

209
00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:14.560
David Schaich (he): depending on how far you've gotten with the homework is that the temperature becomes negative

210
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.880
David Schaich (he): whenever the energy is greater than 0. You solve

211
00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:21.050
David Schaich (he): for the

212
00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:33.580
David Schaich (he): lowest and next lowest energies. Those values were solidly below your phone. but it is possible to have a positive energy.

213
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.490
David Schaich (he): and that's it. A negative temperature.

214
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:43.530
David Schaich (he): Whenever there are more skins. can see a line with the external.

215
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:55.940
David Schaich (he): then there are along with it, so n minus is greater than n plus. So this gets us back to the physical meaning behind this definition of the temperature. that this

216
00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.710
David Schaich (he): positive energy regime

217
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.830
David Schaich (he): is

218
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.680
David Schaich (he): a regime in which.

219
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.820
David Schaich (he): adding energy

220
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.040
David Schaich (he): to the spin system

221
00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:14.730
David Schaich (he): with a fixed number of spins, actually reduces

222
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.680
David Schaich (he): the number of microstates

223
00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.050
David Schaich (he): that the

224
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.950
David Schaich (he): system can adopt in the micro canonical ensemble where the energy is fixed.

225
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:36.980
David Schaich (he): That's getting back to this form of the definition of temperature. If

226
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:44.290
David Schaich (he): a positive increase in energy reduces the logarithm of, and then that sign feeds through

227
00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.040
David Schaich (he): to the temperature itself.

228
00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.380
David Schaich (he): We can also notice that the expression

229
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.680
David Schaich (he): you'll define whatever

230
00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:04.970
David Schaich (he): the magnetic field is turned off, which leads to all microstates having vanishing energy, and gives us a 0 over 0

231
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.520
David Schaich (he): in that expression.

232
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.480
David Schaich (he): But you this

233
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.590
David Schaich (he): unusual behavior it's worth noting as well that

234
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:22.300
David Schaich (he): there is a regime where the temperature is positive and behaves

235
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:26.290
David Schaich (he): more like what we expect. We actually define

236
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.330
David Schaich (he): natural systems

237
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.920
David Schaich (he): that on the screen.

238
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.890
David Schaich (he): so a natural system in the context of temperature

239
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:52.260
David Schaich (he): as you get a positive temperature in the case of the spin system.

240
00:23:54.210 --> 00:24:02.060
David Schaich (he): this requires a negative energy, just like the ground states and the next lowest energy state we started off with.

241
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:07.210
David Schaich (he): So it's a natural regime without the only possible.

242
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.590
David Schaich (he): and this corresponds to the state in which

243
00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:17.330
David Schaich (he): larger amounts of energy increase the number of microstates that are available

244
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.120
David Schaich (he): in the spin system. Even in the natural regime

245
00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.300
David Schaich (he): there is a

246
00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.310
David Schaich (he): minimum temperature.

247
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.350
David Schaich (he): In this case

248
00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.420
David Schaich (he): we have. We can see that

249
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:44.430
David Schaich (he): when the energy becomes the most negative value, it can be at E equals

250
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:50.660
David Schaich (he): minus N. H. From that ground states, and the in one factor of the H cancel.

251
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:57.910
David Schaich (he): and the minimum energy comes out to be yes. minus H.

252
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.670
David Schaich (he): That corresponds to

253
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.240
David Schaich (he): the lowest energy. We compute it.

254
00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.380
David Schaich (he): and We can also see that

255
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.240
whatever we here

256
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:17.460
David Schaich (he): increase the energy in the system.

257
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.790
David Schaich (he): we

258
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:31.970
David Schaich (he): get to a less negative energy. Yeah. reduce the magnitude of the E. That's in the denominator. so

259
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.580
David Schaich (he): that ratio of the temperature also becomes smaller, so it also becomes larger.

260
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:42.340
David Schaich (he): Whatever a smaller number increases the temperature.

261
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:55.530
David Schaich (he): I get matching our expectations for physical systems. So this natural regime is generally what we will be interested in a part for that homework assignment where.

262
00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.570
but also

263
00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.290
David Schaich (he): considering the

264
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:09.920
David Schaich (he): temperature in a similar system, with a difference, analysis, and approximation, rather than using a ring, the wall and

265
00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:16.020
David Schaich (he): checking to see what it really means to have a negative temperature rather than a natural one.
