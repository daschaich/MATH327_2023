1
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:13.870
David Schaich (he): Okay, we can get underway with the final bit of lecture before the break.  Hopefully this microphone will be stable, despite misbehaving a bit just now, before I started the recording.

2
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.040
David Schaich (he): Despite having to restart the whole system, we are able to

3
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.340
David Schaich (he): get under way

4
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.100
not too long after the hour, on

5
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.800
David Schaich (he): approximately the first day of spring,

6
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.050
David Schaich (he): for which the six-digit code will be

7
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.940
David Schaich (he): 8, 1, 0, 5, 7, 3.

8
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.380
David Schaich (he): Before we get underway, I want to make a note of one thing I keep forgetting to mention

9
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.730
David Schaich (he): (in part because we were rushed out of the room for an exam yesterday),

10
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.860
David Schaich (he): which is that the solutions to the homework have been on the Canvas site since last week.

11
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.210
David Schaich (he): Individual feedback should get back to you imminently, either later today or tomorrow at the latest.

12
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.070
David Schaich (he): So a couple of fun things that we can discuss in the on Thursday morning.

13
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:24.930
David Schaich (he): I want to wrapping up dynamic cycles and efficiency. and perhaps all. I hope it's not something else for you to play with it during the

14
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.340
David Schaich (he): in addition to the sample exams that are also have been on campus for several weeks now.

15
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.060
David Schaich (he): but picking up where

16
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.210
David Schaich (he): he left off in a bit of a rush. At the end of

17
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.480
David Schaich (he): yesterday morning we were

18
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.870
David Schaich (he): going into quantum statistics which we should have

19
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.480
David Schaich (he): wrap up today.

20
00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:07.040
David Schaich (he): Do finish this with time to spare. It might take a bit of a preview. You can see where the high quantum gases, but the both of that should be saved after the break. So that do we have to

21
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.430
David Schaich (he): try to remember

22
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.830
exactly where you are

23
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.660
David Schaich (he): over those few weeks.

24
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.350
David Schaich (he): It's a reminder of how some statistics from what we have been doing.

25
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:31.660
David Schaich (he): rather than computing a single critical partition function. raising them to the power of the number of particles, and then trying to correct what we've been doing

26
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.010
David Schaich (he): all the way since we introduced the

27
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.190
for ensemble

28
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:43.990
David Schaich (he): in quantum statistics. The microstates are defined. I something over all possible

29
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.510
David Schaich (he): energy levels which are taken to be discrete.

30
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.150
David Schaich (he): and within each

31
00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:06.760
David Schaich (he): occupation numbers where there are 2 distinct classes of what a particle is characterized by different possible occupation numbers

32
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.880
David Schaich (he): who zones

33
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.890
David Schaich (he): where the occupation number in each energy level

34
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.900
by hill.

35
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.730
David Schaich (he): Nothing.

36
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.800
The individual.

37
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.270
David Schaich (he): you know, that this gives me grand canonical partition function.

38
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:24.540
It was

39
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.620
David Schaich (he): so

40
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.150
David Schaich (he): all over all these energy. Well.

41
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.380
David Schaich (he): times the geometric, still

42
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:45.120
David Schaich (he): regular times. the value of the energy for the corresponding energy level. minus mu, the chemical potential

43
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.640
David Schaich (he): in order for the geometric series to converge. We

44
00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:06.920
David Schaich (he): needed to demand that the chemical potential is less than every year energy level. The value of the energy in every energy level which is generally going to be a guaranteed for natural systems

45
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.860
David Schaich (he): where you're taking the energy

46
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:21.589
David Schaich (he): now negative and the natural chemical potential is negative. So that is what we found when we got up to yesterday.

47
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.140
David Schaich (he): Same computation.

48
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.750
the other classic part of those fermions, with the only possible occupation, numbers

49
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:45.540
David Schaich (he): or 0, and one energy level can either be occupied or unoccupied in multiple occupancy. He's not allowed due to a feature of quantum mechanics rather than

50
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.050
David Schaich (he): any sort of physical.

51
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:55.820
David Schaich (he): So any questions about what we saw yesterday. the what we got up to before we

52
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.500
David Schaich (he): calculation that

53
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.600
David Schaich (he): so i'm, not seeing any

54
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:16.110
David Schaich (he): sign of concern. So the same approach to calculating the

55
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.550
all the occupation numbers for all the energy levels

56
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.470
David Schaich (he): we will go through even more quickly.

57
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.900
David Schaich (he): You know the occupation.

58
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.330
David Schaich (he): What this will give us is

59
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.110
David Schaich (he): a distribution.

60
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.800
David Schaich (he): No, it is very direct statistics

61
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:49.430
David Schaich (he): contrast to an actual Austin statistics of classical particles with discrete energy levels.

62
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.520
David Schaich (he): as we did.

63
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.760
David Schaich (he): We consider it first, a system that just has a single energy level

64
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:13.750
David Schaich (he): label, that is. E. 0, then the grand canonical, proficient function for the system just like the

65
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.190
David Schaich (he): this is some of our microstates.

66
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.750
David Schaich (he): Each microstate has some number of particles in this energy level. so

67
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.210
David Schaich (he): number of particles corresponds to the occupation number of

68
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.740
David Schaich (he): uniquely every microstate. There are only 2 possibilities.

69
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.820
David Schaich (he): One. yeah.

70
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.830
you all

71
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.040
David Schaich (he): exponential factor.

72
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:59.030
David Schaich (he): being the same as before Microsoft energy. It's just that single number of particles that are in this. It's just that in the energy level.

73
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:05.810
David Schaich (he): when that that number of particles is 0, the

74
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.000
David Schaich (he): yeah. there is the answer for a single energy level

75
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.970
David Schaich (he): and generalizing to the arbitrary.

76
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.340
This comfortable number of discrete energy levels

77
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.940
David Schaich (he): so

78
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.170
David Schaich (he): possibly infinite, cut off.

79
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:41.080
David Schaich (he): Yeah. an economical, proficient function, his Majesty. So over the Oh. one of these energy levels

80
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:48.420
David Schaich (he): of that same exponential factory. My name is Hi is the

81
00:07:50.630 --> 00:08:02.420
David Schaich (he): Microsoft Energy. which is now generalizes to the all the energy energy for this energy level as the corresponding occupation number.

82
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.690
David Schaich (he): Similarly for

83
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.250
David Schaich (he): particle number. Yes.

84
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:19.650
David Schaich (he): comes along with the chemical potential that just counts the number of particles occupy the energy level of the occupation number. and

85
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.080
David Schaich (he): as before, this

86
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:35.200
David Schaich (he): energy is a exponential of some of the each of those exponentials depends only on a single value of L. A single occupation number.

87
00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:40.549
David Schaich (he): Distribute them. Hello! All the different sounds.

88
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.920
David Schaich (he): We first some of the exponential factor

89
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.470
David Schaich (he): I see same factor for energy level, 1 2 3, and so on, all the way up to

90
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.780
David Schaich (he): the So

91
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.070
David Schaich (he): this is the

92
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:23.340
David Schaich (he): factorization that makes this so simple. We have a complicated

93
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.770
David Schaich (he): which just boils down to L. One different companies of

94
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.540
David Schaich (he): is something that is all the same except for

95
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.090
David Schaich (he): the value of the energy

96
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.770
David Schaich (he): product over all animals. Oh.

97
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.200
David Schaich (he): 120

98
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.380
David Schaich (he): potential.

99
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:58.200
David Schaich (he): In this case we don't have to worry about the conversions of the geometric series that

100
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.620
David Schaich (he): enforce this requirement for

101
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.300
David Schaich (he): the chemical potential to be less than the energy.

102
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.080
David Schaich (he): you know, constraint on the possible values of the

103
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.190
David Schaich (he): for that

104
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.030
they should be.

105
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:30.000
David Schaich (he): And as for both the Maxwell wholesome statistics that just to any factor to a single particle partition function.

106
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.750
the correct for all accounting

107
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.570
David Schaich (he): as well as distribution.

108
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.900
David Schaich (he): All 3 of these are

109
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.880
David Schaich (he): given my products.

110
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.710
David Schaich (he): which is reminiscent of

111
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.930
David Schaich (he): what we saw earlier

112
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.790
David Schaich (he): over counting. Going into this, you know we too

113
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.350
David Schaich (he): correct rules.

114
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.580
David Schaich (he): so

115
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.180
David Schaich (he): it's.

116
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.900
David Schaich (he): I was briefly to consider what we have

117
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.290
David Schaich (he): clicked.

118
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.620
David Schaich (he): Some of these results that we have

119
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:22.940
David Schaich (he): derive, save for the grand canonical potential for each of these 3 distributions, and

120
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.030
David Schaich (he): all 3 of these

121
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.600
David Schaich (he): functions of the temperature and chemical potential that characterize

122
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.790
David Schaich (he): as a reminder.

123
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:53.460
David Schaich (he): This is the analog of the the temperature of the Actually, all in the case was.

124
00:11:53.670 --> 00:12:00.190
David Schaich (he): you call it exponential factors exponentials

125
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.560
David Schaich (he): which, if we break up the water, the product into a sum of laws.

126
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.740
David Schaich (he): recall that

127
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.190
the next one. She was just

128
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:21.590
David Schaich (he): that's come over just the single exponential factor.

129
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:31.040
David Schaich (he): It's the Grand Canonical potential for it classical.

130
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:40.570
David Schaich (he): free energy to it. creating all the potential.

131
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:47.520
David Schaich (he): the water. This great economical partition function

132
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.440
David Schaich (he): we can

133
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:56.020
David Schaich (he): invert, so I can break up the

134
00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:02.580
David Schaich (he): The one over X is minus the one that cancels out with the overall I to sign up.

135
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.980
David Schaich (he): So we're then left with just the positive

136
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.220
David Schaich (he): of those that difference in the denominator

137
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.400
David Schaich (he): like this. the exponential factor

138
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.620
David Schaich (he): There' a direct distribution.

139
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.530
We again.

140
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.990
David Schaich (he): you know everything.

141
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.090
David Schaich (he): One for me. Yeah. Potential

142
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:47.290
is.

143
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.400
David Schaich (he): you are the same as

144
00:13:52.680 --> 00:14:06.590
David Schaich (he): the both Einstein case. Except for the overall negative sign out for us a relative they can assign within each of the turns out to be significant, as we will see.

145
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:17.490
I just remove it after it.

146
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:25.300
David Schaich (he): There. Any questions or objections about yeah results that we have collected from yesterday and today.

147
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.820
David Schaich (he): The question I want to

148
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.450
David Schaich (he): pose for us to think about now is.

149
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.810
David Schaich (he): How are these results?

150
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.120
David Schaich (he): I'm not asking, Are they

151
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:42.970
this place on

152
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.770
David Schaich (he): specifically asking how? Because

153
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:47.760
David Schaich (he): we can

154
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:59.030
David Schaich (he): appreciate just from our everyday experience that even though quantum physics that's going into it was on it's time.

155
00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.230
Fairly direct

156
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.570
David Schaich (he): distributions

157
00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.280
David Schaich (he): governs the University fundamental level.

158
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.960
David Schaich (he): Practical statistics was perfectly good enough for

159
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.690
David Schaich (he): everything that this did. Up until the early twentieth century.

160
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:24.250
David Schaich (he): So there it is. Hey, here regime in which that classical physics should emerge from the underlying behavior. and

161
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:38.460
David Schaich (he): in this context the classical physics is here by the the actual wholesale distribution. so that Maxwell. Some have been related to either, or

162
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.350
David Schaich (he): of the quantum distributions, for

163
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.020
David Schaich (he): it was almost.

164
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:56.600
David Schaich (he): and based on the argument we went through about

165
00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.040
David Schaich (he): the different ways of driving.

166
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.320
David Schaich (he): Oh.

167
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:15.040
David Schaich (he): taking the single particle partition function to a large power, and correcting for over counting versus going through energy level occupation numbers.

168
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:20.360
David Schaich (he): We have seen that those 2 approaches are equivalent where

169
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.410
David Schaich (he): there is very little chance of multiple particles trying to

170
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.500
David Schaich (he): hang out with the same energy level. See that a different way.

171
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:37.880
David Schaich (he): Maybe it number of accessible energy levels is much greater than the number of particles.

172
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.820
David Schaich (he): and then there is little chance of any of those in particles.

173
00:16:52.900 --> 00:17:00.520
David Schaich (he): The same energy level. The over counting is that straightforward factor of one over n factorial that we have seen many times.

174
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.710
David Schaich (he): And then this is the

175
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:13.040
David Schaich (he): situation or regime where we should expect to see the 2 types of derivations that we have done

176
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:19.170
David Schaich (he): classical and quantum statistics, all producing the same behavior or the same

177
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.510
David Schaich (he): economical potential, you know the

178
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:34.100
David Schaich (he): So let's take another step in the house. Now, When is the number of accessible energy levels? What's created in the number of

179
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.910
okay.

180
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:43.370
David Schaich (he): actually answer that by turning the question on his head, and we call something that we did a few weeks ago.

181
00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.170
Yes.

182
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.530
David Schaich (he): it's been

183
00:17:55.390 --> 00:18:01.160
David Schaich (he): the derived internal energy and entropy, or

184
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:10.000
David Schaich (he): and looked at how those qualities behaved in the limits of high and low temperature.

185
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.120
David Schaich (he): So, in particular that

186
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:22.380
David Schaich (he): probability, you know, microstates ahead high energy utilities compared to

187
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.950
David Schaich (he): we're exponentially suppressed

188
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:37.090
David Schaich (he): in practice inaccessible. When you temperature.

189
00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.870
David Schaich (he): Whoa! You always say

190
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.780
David Schaich (he): factor of

191
00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.390
David Schaich (he): E to the minus energy

192
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.880
David Schaich (he): over team in the

193
00:18:53.900 --> 00:19:05.240
David Schaich (he): and as the temperature gets low, the negative argument to the exponential has a large magnitude, the exponential itself. it goes down to 0. So this is the situation

194
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:10.240
David Schaich (he): in which. if you're a small number of microstates are accessible.

195
00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:18.680
David Schaich (he): it's effectively the opposite of where we expect classical, the quantum physics to coincide.

196
00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.180
David Schaich (he): So, therefore. this is telling us that

197
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:26.630
David Schaich (he): in order to see classical physics emerge from quantum statistics.

198
00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.170
David Schaich (he): high temperature.

199
00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.680
David Schaich (he): which we can go ahead and check.

200
00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.430
David Schaich (he): So

201
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.590
David Schaich (he): to check this conclusion that we are making based on

202
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:50.270
David Schaich (he): some arguments from a few weeks ago. Let's compute

203
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:57.330
David Schaich (he): something for our 3 distributions with discrete energy levels.

204
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.390
David Schaich (he): and see how the prediction in all 3 cases differ or approach each other

205
00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:13.380
David Schaich (he): in this high temperature limits. So if we look at the average number of particles.

206
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:24.920
David Schaich (he): the fluctuating we derived yesterday's just given by the negative derivative of the very economical potential. With respect to the chemical potential.

207
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.800
David Schaich (he): it starts

208
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.240
David Schaich (he): 50, an actual host in case

209
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.260
David Schaich (he): we want to.

210
00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.280
David Schaich (he): On this expression

211
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.650
David Schaich (he): into the derivative which is

212
00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:59.010
David Schaich (he): fairly simple. There is the negative sign that cancels no real factor of T, a sum over energy levels derivative with respect to the

213
00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:11.070
David Schaich (he): familiar exponential factor which just brings down a positive actor to Beta. which is the in it, cancels out the overall factor of the

214
00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:20.710
David Schaich (he): I'm. Sure. giving us a sum over all of the exponential. which I will go ahead and write as one over

215
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.130
David Schaich (he): in this arguments.

216
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.480
David Schaich (he): a simple exponential

217
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.920
for each of the S.

218
00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.540
David Schaich (he): And the reason for doing this will

219
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:49.460
David Schaich (he): we come up here when we move on to to keep this procedure for. do you? It was on sign that distribution. There is now. No.

220
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.620
David Schaich (he): you know what we think of the derivative

221
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.930
David Schaich (he): persists.

222
00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:00.870
David Schaich (he): We have again some over hell and the derivative, of

223
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:05.440
David Schaich (he): we log rhythm for each other. Sheet, like all of the

224
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:06.650
David Schaich (he): 0

225
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:18.060
David Schaich (he): and the numerator. We go through the chain rule and we'll pick up a

226
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:31.840
David Schaich (he): overall factor of the role might assign for having a one minus exponential is a positive. they e to the minus beta energy minus chemical potential.

227
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.940
David Schaich (he): You can be that in temperature. If we

228
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:40.410
David Schaich (he): you can divide through by this exponential factor.

229
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:46.510
David Schaich (he): We end up with one over an exponential, with a positive beta

230
00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:49.660
David Schaich (he): minus one.

231
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.510
David Schaich (he): It finally be that

232
00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:00.760
David Schaich (he): through it very direct critical number again difference by a sign

233
00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.590
as the same

234
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:11.120
David Schaich (he): logarithmic structure that brings the argument. Now, what plus e to the minus scale.

235
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.270
David Schaich (he): 30 minus chemical potential

236
00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.720
David Schaich (he): exponential factor

237
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.860
cancels out the temperature

238
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.600
David Schaich (he): and gives us so

239
00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:27.940
David Schaich (he): one minus

240
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.590
David Schaich (he): the exponential factor now plus one.

241
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:39.110
David Schaich (he): So several sanity checks we can immediately make

242
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.390
David Schaich (he): on these results. So

243
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.350
David Schaich (he): first of all. They're all written as sums over energy levels which, given the

244
00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:57.660
David Schaich (he): that we had earlier the number of particles for each micro state.

245
00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:02.490
David Schaich (he): it's just equal to the sum of occupation numbers over energy levels.

246
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:03.900
David Schaich (he): Like the energy.

247
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.230
David Schaich (he): we can identify this as

248
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:15.050
David Schaich (he): in each case it some over expectation values with the occupation numbers themselves

249
00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.290
David Schaich (he): 3 distributions

250
00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.350
David Schaich (he): actual.

251
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.230
David Schaich (he): It's fairly direct

252
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.590
David Schaich (he): to these occupation numbers.

253
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.000
David Schaich (he): Just to you

254
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.900
David Schaich (he): we have get minus one

255
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.620
David Schaich (he): denominator and for

256
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:02.650
you.

257
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.730
David Schaich (he): So all of these

258
00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:20.760
David Schaich (he): expectation values for the occupation numbers you can check. thanks to

259
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:23.910
David Schaich (he): yeah

260
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:32.900
David Schaich (he): exponential function as well as in the bose-einstein case or condition that the energy is greater than the chemical potential.

261
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.370
David Schaich (he): Oh.

262
00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.990
David Schaich (he): non-negative. And in general positive

263
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.180
David Schaich (he): I can for that for sure. we can also share that

264
00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.490
David Schaich (he): occupation number is bounded.

265
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.660
David Schaich (he): It should be given that

266
00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:56.690
David Schaich (he): yeah.

267
00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:08.540
David Schaich (he): only possible values of the So those are a few checks. And

268
00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:12.270
David Schaich (he): all of these results for the occupation numbers.

269
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.100
David Schaich (he): we'll agree

270
00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.430
David Schaich (he): where

271
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:25.330
David Schaich (he): the is being added in the denominator or subtracted, is many more compared to the exponential struggle.

272
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:29.890
David Schaich (he): We have one over an

273
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:42.070
David Schaich (he): do you know. i'm just energy minus chemical potential. much greater than one. All of these will a year

274
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.260
David Schaich (he): effectively the same value in that value

275
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:55.710
David Schaich (he): no longer needs a label. is going to be much less than one by having that very large factor.

276
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.150
the nominator.

277
00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:03.940
David Schaich (he): This is also a sanity check, because it reproduces what we said

278
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:07.150
David Schaich (he): just a few minutes ago, arguing more

279
00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:18.280
David Schaich (he): conceptually rather than mathematically. that we should look for agreement between classical and quantum physics when the number of accessible energy levels is much greater than the number

280
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:19.390
particles.

281
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:30.350
David Schaich (he): which is the same as saying that the you occupation number the number of particles in each energy level is going to be a very small No.

282
00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.010
David Schaich (he): So all of this makes sense.

283
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.680
David Schaich (he): except for one thing.

284
00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.450
David Schaich (he): which is that

285
00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.580
David Schaich (he): argument to this exponential saying that

286
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.860
David Schaich (he): classical is

287
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:10.280
David Schaich (he): energy minus chemical potential. large number. To give a large exponential factor. This you already before

288
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.600
David Schaich (he): the high temperature

289
00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.580
David Schaich (he): which

290
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:32.000
David Schaich (he): on initial inspection it does not the height. Remember, the temperature is one over data, or it is whatever temperature. So for a high temperature you would have

291
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.510
David Schaich (he): bigger going to 0.

292
00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.800
David Schaich (he): And if we

293
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.760
David Schaich (he): fix the the of the chemical potential and

294
00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:50.000
David Schaich (he): energy for a given energy level. So that's right. One of the

295
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:54.010
David Schaich (he): records is fixed. High temperature seems to correspond to

296
00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.880
David Schaich (he): 0, which we want to be much greater than one.

297
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.650
David Schaich (he): you know. In these 3 expressions it's

298
00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:09.040
David Schaich (he): be the times that difference in parentheses not too far. In each of these 3 occupation numbers

299
00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:12.620
David Schaich (he): you will see that

300
00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:25.580
David Schaich (he): exponential factor approaching one E to the 0. In this my high temperature limits being a one to 0 with a fixed energy lines, chemical potential.

301
00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:32.450
David Schaich (he): That's what this occupation number would be around. What was that?

302
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:34.610
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

303
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:45.660
David Schaich (he): One over one plus one, and it goes to 0 about half. And it.

304
00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.060
if you go sign sign case.

305
00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:55.260
David Schaich (he): we approach whatever one minus one. So we occupation number that actually the

306
00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:01.350
David Schaich (he): which does not look anything at all like the classical limit that we had to find by

307
00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.460
David Schaich (he): demanding that these 3 results

308
00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.660
David Schaich (he): do the same.

309
00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.280
David Schaich (he): The way out of this, you might already have guessed, is

310
00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:23.170
David Schaich (he): to recognize that we do 2 things when thinking about the high temperature. First we took the temperature large, be it to 0, but then we fixed

311
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.920
David Schaich (he): difference between the energy and the chemical potential.

312
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:33.000
David Schaich (he): and really the high temperature that we should be considering.

313
00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:36.810
I'll call the true

314
00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:56.380
David Schaich (he): the temperature and negative chemical potential to simultaneously in such a way such that that negative chemical potential.

315
00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:04.310
David Schaich (he): you remember the chemical potential that needs to be much larger than the temperature which itself needs to be much larger than

316
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:09.820
David Schaich (he): the relevant micro state Energies are sorry to you. energy levels.

317
00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:14.760
David Schaich (he): and we can

318
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.890
David Schaich (he): appreciate that what is going on in this double what

319
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.780
to

320
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.000
David Schaich (he): agreement between classical

321
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:26.000
physics.

322
00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.850
David Schaich (he): The very high temperature is

323
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:38.110
David Schaich (he): making all of these microstate probabilities. More likely it's suppressing the energies

324
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.810
David Schaich (he): that would otherwise exponentially suppress

325
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.280
the

326
00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.480
David Schaich (he): larger number of

327
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:49.020
David Schaich (he): accessible energy levels.

328
00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:57.980
David Schaich (he): What might happen if we took just maybe to 0 the high temperature limit

329
00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:12.820
David Schaich (he): without adjusting the chemical potential is that we to end up with more and more particles, trying to fill those energy levels that are picking up a more than a probability from our distribution.

330
00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.260
David Schaich (he): So the other aspect of this limit.

331
00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:28.960
David Schaich (he): Chemical potential to more and more negative films is. I'm. Sure it does. Fewer particles are available to feel the energy levels

332
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:30.570
accessible

333
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:39.870
David Schaich (he): to get back to the situation of it. Very small occupation numbers where there is a

334
00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:46.310
David Schaich (he): good chance that all the particles are in different energy levels, and therefore, over counting.

335
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.970
David Schaich (he): coming from you classical. It

336
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.520
David Schaich (he): is just you, in my view.

337
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.320
David Schaich (he): in factorial labels between here.

338
00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:58.020
correct

339
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:01.540
David Schaich (he): as we have been, this problem.

340
00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:09.100
David Schaich (he): or we first introduced the distinction between distinguishable.

341
00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:11.650
So

342
00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:12.860
David Schaich (he): back in

343
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:29.490
David Schaich (he): in the So you can now get back to this diagram that I had on the screen at the start just to touch the focus of projector for today. which is showing

344
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.430
David Schaich (he): what we just computed

345
00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:37.840
David Schaich (he): expectation value for the occupation number of an arbitrary

346
00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:51.820
David Schaich (he): energy level, some given value of the energy and will be where it's also access. We have this combination of data times, the energy minus chemical potential that goes into

347
00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:57.530
David Schaich (he): the exponential factors. So this block is just showing up these 3

348
00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:00.740
David Schaich (he): distributions. Yeah, we compute it

349
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.960
David Schaich (he): where you can immediately see

350
00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:10.670
David Schaich (he): that's where this combination is large, much greater than one. We do

351
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.940
good agreement between

352
00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:23.710
David Schaich (he): the classical of actual Boltzmann distribution in both both sides, and fairly direct distributions for

353
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.820
David Schaich (he): the 2 different types of call to particles.

354
00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:34.409
David Schaich (he): the incorrect high temperature limit. Look at at first

355
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.889
0 of fixing

356
00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:38.880
David Schaich (he): difference between energy and capital

357
00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:39.699
sure

358
00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:42.389
David Schaich (he): would have given us this

359
00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.320
David Schaich (he): vertical line at 0 on the X Axis.

360
00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:47.889
David Schaich (he): where, as we saw.

361
00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.060
David Schaich (he): actual Boltzmann distribution was around one.

362
00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:55.670
David Schaich (he): I know.

363
00:34:55.989 --> 00:35:00.670
David Schaich (he): and distribution is actually in that limit.

364
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.360
David Schaich (he): and

365
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.790
David Schaich (he): you can also see. So this is

366
00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:09.800
David Schaich (he): the true classical high temperature.

367
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:14.670
David Schaich (he): This is what time is your regime where

368
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:17.790
David Schaich (he): there are enormous differences between

369
00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:21.140
David Schaich (he): all 3 of the distributions that we have

370
00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.350
David Schaich (he): compute it.

371
00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:31.160
David Schaich (he): we can confirm that the very direct distribution of approaches is

372
00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.440
David Schaich (he): upper bound. Here every single

373
00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:36.620
David Schaich (he): energy level is occupied.

374
00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.010
There is

375
00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.220
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

376
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:48.170
David Schaich (he): The expectation value for the occupation numbers approaching the maximum possible.

377
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.310
Tell you what one

378
00:35:51.250 --> 00:36:00.920
David Schaich (he): The Maxwell holes in the classroom to 6 in the week time are increasing exponentially scale of this

379
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:08.080
David Schaich (he): figure. and the distribution has actually been published.

380
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:21.270
David Schaich (he): This combination, Beta Times E minus mu approaches 0, which corresponds to the violation of our condition for the convergence of the geometric sequence

381
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:22.380
David Schaich (he): that the

382
00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:25.770
David Schaich (he): chemical potential is always less than

383
00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.830
David Schaich (he): the energy in which, with a positive temperature. we demand

384
00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:35.920
David Schaich (he): that the both sides and distribution be restricted only to positive values

385
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:48.920
David Schaich (he): on this figure. So this is a nice visual summary of the 3 distributions we have come up with on the basis of discrete energy levels.

386
00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:56.050
David Schaich (he): 2 quantum distributions for and then

387
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:59.830
David Schaich (he): classical Maxwell Austin distribution

388
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:07.250
David Schaich (he): 800 compact summary of the ways. All those different systems

389
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.950
David Schaich (he): differ, and also approach each other in the classic.

390
00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:25.890
David Schaich (he): So that is essentially a good place to stop. We have 10 min left just a bit of a preview of all of the uses

391
00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.650
you know, focus on after the break. For now, though.

392
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:37.770
David Schaich (he): are there any questions about the quantum statistics in general. as we have

393
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:05.080
David Schaich (he): deciding on the fly, how much of it Look at how we do it, and how

394
00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.810
David Schaich (he): I don't want to go through this. Given that we go.

395
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.750
David Schaich (he): We need a reminder when we come back from the

396
00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.190
David Schaich (he): quick preview.

397
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:36.360
David Schaich (he): These quantum gases are going to be our main application of the and in order to

398
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:43.150
David Schaich (he): with the

399
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.500
David Schaich (he): quantum statistics. Yes. we just finished discussing.

400
00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:54.960
David Schaich (he): All we want to do is

401
00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.890
David Schaich (he): determine the

402
00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:10.400
David Schaich (he): energies. Yes. we're going to the grand canonical partition functions in the quasi- now use the energy before

403
00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:25.120
David Schaich (he): the energy levels of the relevant systems that we can. The grand canonical partition function for for

404
00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.680
David Schaich (he): the

405
00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.870
you would consider it

406
00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:34.320
David Schaich (he): 2,

407
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.830
David Schaich (he): many cases, one of which is almost

408
00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:41.660
David Schaich (he): something.

409
00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.210
Yeah, with that before

410
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:44.740
David Schaich (he): in classical ideas.

411
00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:45.610
Yeah, since

412
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:47.960
David Schaich (he): these 2 cases are

413
00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:55.160
David Schaich (he): yeah.

414
00:39:57.070 --> 00:40:06.300
David Schaich (he): the opposite ultra relativistic particles. So or not all this the case. the contribution to the energy problem.

415
00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:12.630
David Schaich (he): Each part of the goal with Mass M is the usual momentum square over 2. M.

416
00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:21.460
David Schaich (he): That's piece. and we have going through the exercise of

417
00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:26.620
David Schaich (he): discretizing these energies. They can energy levels in terms of.

418
00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:32.420
David Schaich (he): and

419
00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.670
David Schaich (he): to seek into your back to

420
00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:39.930
David Schaich (he): the

421
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:52.320
David Schaich (he): where. when change that we you to make it a quantum context is that each of these components Oh. it's 3, hecta. K.

422
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:57.230
David Schaich (he): Now with no one. It starts capital from 0.

423
00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:01.470
David Schaich (he): It has a new value of Yeah.

424
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:05.220
We can go from there once and so on.

425
00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:18.980
David Schaich (he): The motivation for this my motivation, but the requirement for this is actually coming from a piece of quantum physics. I expect you to

426
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.230
David Schaich (he): seeing in detail which is known as the

427
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:27.150
David Schaich (he): uncertainty principle

428
00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.870
David Schaich (he): which states roughly that

429
00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:39.440
David Schaich (he): precision with which it is possible to know the position of a part

430
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:41.340
or x in any one of the

431
00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:47.760
David Schaich (he): pretty special dimensions is. how do you get to the precision with which.

432
00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:56.910
David Schaich (he): in that direction the product of it? Those 2,

433
00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:03.350
David Schaich (he): this to be

434
00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.370
David Schaich (he): larger than roughly each part of it.

435
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:07.690
There's a 2 in high.

436
00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:15.210
David Schaich (he): We don't care about in our approach for discretizing momenta and energies.

437
00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:20.690
David Schaich (he): We put ideal gas in a box of

438
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:21.770
the queue.

439
00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:23.490
David Schaich (he): which means that we know

440
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.650
David Schaich (he): precision with which we can

441
00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.030
David Schaich (he): location of the particle is

442
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:42.570
David Schaich (he): at most. It is somewhere in that box which we then rearrange is that the preceding

443
00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.310
which is

444
00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:47.850
David Schaich (he): use

445
00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.340
David Schaich (he): and a minimum H bar over L.

446
00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:57.550
David Schaich (he): Precisely what we get? I will borrow it the surprise calculation

447
00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:00.340
David Schaich (he): if You' to it.

448
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.270
The components of this cave

449
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:03.580
David Schaich (he): start from one

450
00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:05.540
0. So this means to

451
00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:15.970
David Schaich (he): somewhat different counting of the energy levels that will go through a detail after the break. Now just state probably this on the other screen

452
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:28.660
David Schaich (he): particle mass approaching 0. We deal with masses, particles like photons, particles of light.

453
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:43.490
David Schaich (he): It was not the suite of flames with vanishing mass. and we cannot use the same expression. The that's going to 0 instead.

454
00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:52.240
David Schaich (he): The energy for all the realistic particle is the speed of light. I'm. And the same discretization

455
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:55.430
David Schaich (he): of the

456
00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:03.390
David Schaich (he): corresponding integer. Vector K.

457
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:04.570
That same

458
00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:10.170
David Schaich (he): one

459
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.480
David Schaich (he): and the

460
00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.600
David Schaich (he): square

461
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:18.830
David Schaich (he): your product.

462
00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.030
David Schaich (he): and we will see that

463
00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:28.970
David Schaich (he): it is most convenient in

464
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.610
David Schaich (he): the case of all the relativistic

465
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:33.370
David Schaich (he): to

466
00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:37.510
David Schaich (he): It's.

467
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:38.720
David Schaich (he): We are

468
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:47.490
David Schaich (he): here. it's, interpreted as what's called a wave number.

469
00:44:50.110 --> 00:45:01.780
David Schaich (he): the inverse of the length of the way for the so. If we look at the inverse K, we have to twice the volume

470
00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:04.260
David Schaich (he): that gives us the

471
00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.860
David Schaich (he): all times

472
00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:12.920
David Schaich (he): and

473
00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.060
David Schaich (he): the you

474
00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.460
David Schaich (he): the relation between that what we you like, and

475
00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:34.550
David Schaich (he): frequency of each wave crossing over some details

476
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:40.120
David Schaich (he): going through too much right here now.

477
00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:53.020
David Schaich (he): and the frequency in terms of 2 high radians, or the rotational frequency

478
00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:57.230
David Schaich (he): related by the speed of light.

479
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:08.860
David Schaich (he): So the angular frequency is the continuous analog of the integer. We have Number K.

480
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:12.470
David Schaich (he): This into

481
00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:28.200
David Schaich (he): gives us the equals H. Bar Omega. We are large energies correspond to large frequencies for small.

482
00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:29.070
David Schaich (he): So

483
00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:37.790
David Schaich (he): yeah.

484
00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:40.980
David Schaich (he): high frequency.

485
00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.010
David Schaich (he): This is No. He has

486
00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:52.720
David Schaich (he): ultraviolet regime.

487
00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.640
David Schaich (he): Small energies correspond to

488
00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:01.200
David Schaich (he): low frequencies and

489
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:07.180
David Schaich (he): sure

490
00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:13.580
David Schaich (he): regime.

491
00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:17.620
David Schaich (he): just based on the connection between

492
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:21.480
David Schaich (he): visible light and the wavelength of that point.

493
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:31.000
David Schaich (he): That is probably a detail we should come back to after the break collection of ingredients that you.

494
00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.490
but to use

495
00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:34.840
David Schaich (he): driving

496
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:37.450
David Schaich (he): quantum gases

497
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.570
David Schaich (he): too extreme in the cases.

498
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:43.460
David Schaich (he): No.

499
00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.250
David Schaich (he): So we will

500
00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:55.650
David Schaich (he): briefly summarize these basic ingredients. You're back next month just to confirm

501
00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:00.000
David Schaich (he): that I mentioned

502
00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:09.180
David Schaich (he): of an overall statistic particle becomes more this energy becomes well, the frequency becomes low.

503
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:12.420
I temperature

504
00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.810
David Schaich (he): other direction.

505
00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:21.300
David Schaich (he): I'm sure the energy and frequency

506
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:28.060
David Schaich (he): so hopefully that it's made you excited to see how all this feeds into partition, functions.

507
00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:32.280
David Schaich (he): entropy, energy, and all the rest. Once we get back

508
00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:39.340
David Schaich (he): from the break, which I will take a break for the rest of the day, unless there are any final questions.
