00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:15.200
David Schaich (he): Okay, I think we can get underway. It's been exactly a month since we were last in this room, so I had to sign into everything fresh. And,

2
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.310
David Schaich (he): well, before getting underway I should give you

3
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:35.190
David Schaich (he): the 6 digit code for today, here on the doc-cam.

4
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.840
David Schaich (he): The six

5
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.060
David Schaich (he): digits are

6
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.880
David Schaich (he): 9, 8, 0, 0, 3, 2.

7
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.880
Yep.

8
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.700
David Schaich (he): I'll also put that up here,

9
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.370
David Schaich (he): because I'm going to pop away from the projector for

10
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.770
David Schaich (he): just a few minutes and start with some logistical notes.

11
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:40.680
David Schaich (he): So one thing that may be of interest is that I have uploaded to canvas model solutions for the computer project that was to last week.  Both

12
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.790
David Schaich (he): a pdf and

13
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:54.080
David Schaich (he): the corresponding Python code. The pdf looks a bit bulkier than it really is, because it includes all of the code that is also

14
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.340
David Schaich (he): in this file separately.

15
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.300
David Schaich (he): My self-imposed deadline for getting those marked and

16
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.690
David Schaich (he): feedback returned to you is tomorrow, which I'm not going to make.  Apologies for

17
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.870
David Schaich (he): being slow

18
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.720
David Schaich (he): accumulation of deadlines probably due to the medical difficulties this past month.

19
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.360
David Schaich (he): Try to

20
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.620
David Schaich (he): catch up with that just over the next few days, and see if there are any issues worth discussing with these solutions

21
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.540
David Schaich (he): in in next week's tutorial. We now have

22
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.010
David Schaich (he): tutorials in here on Thursday mornings, on a regular basis for the

23
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.270
David Schaich (he): we can get back into

24
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.540
David Schaich (he): the habit of helping in here, and

25
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.140
David Schaich (he): model solutions for the homework also go on to canvas.

26
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.710
David Schaich (he): Whether or not I get those marked once

27
00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:00.020
David Schaich (he): sort of 5 day period of like penalties passes over the coming week.

28
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.850
David Schaich (he): And

29
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.890
David Schaich (he): yeah, if there are any questions about.

30
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:17.000
David Schaich (he): at least the computer project, we can discuss this now, or any aspect of the lectures. The tutorial is a good opportunity to

31
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.950
David Schaich (he): follow up on points that maybe here confusing.

32
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:36.460
David Schaich (he): hearing any questions get under way with a couple of tutorial activities that are

33
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:49.630
David Schaich (he): to be relevant to. Oh. so things that we have done over the last few weeks, as well as one of the pieces of the upcoming extra on

34
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.460
David Schaich (he): Monday. So both of these tutorials

35
00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:02.650
David Schaich (he): are in the modules page on canvas, and I also printed out it couple of copies in case they might be useful to have one of them

36
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.080
David Schaich (he): looking at Sterling's formula, and the other looking at the entropy.

37
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.820
David Schaich (he): So let me just

38
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.430
David Schaich (he): say a few words to introduce each of these.

39
00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.190
David Schaich (he): the idea being that

40
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.660
David Schaich (he): we'll talk through sort of set up to the activity. You'll get some time to

41
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.880
David Schaich (he): play with it today, and then

42
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.060
David Schaich (he): chances are there will be more to do that. I can leave you with for

43
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.170
David Schaich (he): the coming week and the at the start of next Week's tutorial. Okay. highlight any here

44
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.940
David Schaich (he): main takeaways from these activities, any questions about them, and then move on to

45
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.080
David Schaich (he): the next one.

46
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.320
David Schaich (he): So that gives you a bit more to do during the weeks. Now that

47
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:58.620
David Schaich (he): the computer project and homework are wrapped up, at least until you return from the screen break reminds me of one other piece of

48
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:12.760
David Schaich (he): one of the resource that is also on canvas. Now zoom in a bit. I have uploaded it. Sample exams from each of the past 3 years. If you have the time and inclination to

49
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.240
David Schaich (he): start poking through those, seeing what sort of

50
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:25.320
David Schaich (he): questions tend to be asked. And but the usual format is. I will say that

51
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.860
David Schaich (he): each of those 3 years was unusual in terms of

52
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.790
David Schaich (he): lectures, exams, and in general. And so

53
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.530
David Schaich (he): for the exam, coming up this year in May or June. It's going to be a 2 h exam

54
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:44.910
David Schaich (he): in person

55
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.300
David Schaich (he): last year. The exam was also in person, but limited to a single hour.

56
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.590
David Schaich (he): So the 3 questions that are on here

57
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.570
David Schaich (he): I could

58
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.230
David Schaich (he): less work that will be asked for the 2 h that you'll have

59
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.430
David Schaich (he): this year

60
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.690
David Schaich (he): the previous exams in 2,020 and 2,021. We're both

61
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.990
David Schaich (he): both ended up being

62
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:27.730
David Schaich (he): open book Exams done remotely, and uploaded the 2,020 exam, which was prepared before the pandemic struck, was designed for a 2 and a half hour Exam. So it has a larger number of

63
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.920
David Schaich (he): cool.

64
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.790
David Schaich (he): challenging questions. So it is a

65
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.640
David Schaich (he): it better model of what the exam is going to look like

66
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.950
David Schaich (he): this spring.

67
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.820
David Schaich (he): So I think those are all the logistical notes I have this morning we can turn to

68
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.880
David Schaich (he): these actual tutorial activities. which why? I

69
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.670
David Schaich (he): brought up one of the things that we were doing

70
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:08.230
David Schaich (he): a couple of weeks ago, when, meeting the second law of thermodynamics in the context of the micro canonical software, we we went through the exercise of

71
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:14.330
David Schaich (he): taking 2 micro canonical systems. They fixed number of particles and fixed energy.

72
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:20.960
David Schaich (he): placing them in front of the contact. Should that be overall, the energy

73
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.440
David Schaich (he): is still conserved, but can be distributed in various ways

74
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.020
David Schaich (he): throughout these 2 systems.

75
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:37.400
David Schaich (he): and then trying to figure out the overall number of micro states.

76
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.500
David Schaich (he): So

77
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.750
David Schaich (he): the total number of possible microstates was combined system, and

78
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:53.000
David Schaich (he): was not only the product of the number of microstates, each of the cell systems, but had to

79
00:07:53.150 --> 00:08:01.420
David Schaich (he): some over all possible ways. or that total energy to be distributed between those 2 subsystems.

80
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.390
David Schaich (he): So I just rewrite that here to have it in.

81
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:21.330
David Schaich (he): In this example, this whole number of my states. let's say, sell over energy distributions

82
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.790
David Schaich (he): of the

83
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:33.159
David Schaich (he): subsystem one remaining energy in subsystem 2, and we

84
00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:40.730
David Schaich (he): noted that this is obviously greater than the number of microstates, as the

85
00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.380
David Schaich (he): entropy is greater than the entropy that we had before

86
00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:48.720
David Schaich (he): we separated subsystems which just correspond to one term

87
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:55.360
David Schaich (he): in the sum of all of our negative terms. so that people say

88
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.260
David Schaich (he): inequality that you identified as the second law

89
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.820
David Schaich (he): of thermodynamics.

90
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.860
David Schaich (he): We are going to be revisiting this sort of thing on Monday.

91
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.280
David Schaich (he): Let me look at

92
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:17.440
David Schaich (he): more elaborate procedure analogous to the heat exchange. We considered taking 2 systems, putting them together, and then we separated them.

93
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.810
David Schaich (he): and trying to ensure that

94
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.760
David Schaich (he): you entropy in that 3 step process.

95
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:31.720
David Schaich (he): It is consistent with the second wall thermal dynamics. For this

96
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.000
David Schaich (he): we are going to

97
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.350
David Schaich (he): the interested in.

98
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:45.290
David Schaich (he): Say, more than just that basic inequality about this total number of microstates.

99
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.700
David Schaich (he): so

100
00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:02.810
David Schaich (he): simple but fairly sharp bounds on this total number microstates which we can get

101
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:08.920
David Schaich (he): with a pretty simple consideration of the structure of the terms

102
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.240
David Schaich (he): in this cell.

103
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:12.350
David Schaich (he): So

104
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.340
David Schaich (he): if we

105
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:22.400
David Schaich (he): let the if we denote the largest term in this cell. it is.

106
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.370
David Schaich (he): Yes, Max.

107
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.970
David Schaich (he): and if we say that there are

108
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.230
David Schaich (he): in terms of the which

109
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.000
David Schaich (he): off the page. so there is

110
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.420
that you center.

111
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.680
David Schaich (he): Then there are, is a fairly

112
00:10:52.510 --> 00:11:06.990
David Schaich (he): obvious set of balance that we can have similarly to what we did. I'm talking about the second World thermodynamics. We know that the single term has to be the larger than the sum of all the terms

113
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.630
David Schaich (he): where the quality holds. If there is only one term in the.

114
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.370
David Schaich (he): and then

115
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.630
David Schaich (he): we also know that the some

116
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.810
David Schaich (he): has to be no larger than case

117
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:30.710
David Schaich (he): where every single term in it is the same, and is equal to

118
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.030
David Schaich (he): this maximum.

119
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.310
David Schaich (he): That projector, any act sure.

120
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:49.350
David Schaich (he): So the quality here holds all of the terms in some are the same in our

121
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:54.430
David Schaich (he): maximize. If we take the walk room of all of these

122
00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:04.030
David Schaich (he): pieces that we have. That was on the entropy just before the the micro canonical on cell phone.

123
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.710
David Schaich (he): and despite the

124
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:18.030
David Schaich (he): simplicity of this derivation, it turns out that this is.

125
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:23.140
David Schaich (he): hey? Actually useful, a all of constraining

126
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.830
David Schaich (he): the entropy. So, as a

127
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.410
David Schaich (he): reasonable illustration of it. the power of this way of looking at

128
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.000
David Schaich (he): the set up. we can

129
00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.120
David Schaich (he): suppose for an end particle system

130
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.740
over Charles

131
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:49.320
David Schaich (he): in this. It's just related to those end particles.

132
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:59.690
David Schaich (he): I'll leave you to work through a concrete example where this is the case. and we can also suppose that.

133
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:06.120
David Schaich (he): or this term is

134
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.780
David Schaich (he): exponentially large in that number of particles.

135
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:16.500
David Schaich (he): This is also something that we have seeing it in the context of it. Spin system.

136
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:28.510
David Schaich (he): We are sitting aside in the external magnetic field the number of terms which is to the end the 2 possibilities for each of the n particles

137
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.650
David Schaich (he): which is the exponential of

138
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.810
David Schaich (he): how Cisco

139
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.910
David Schaich (he): World 2

140
00:13:46.800 --> 00:14:00.470
David Schaich (he): in this case give us that. and is less than you're comfortable. She has just

141
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.150
David Schaich (he): and terms plus the

142
00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:12.220
David Schaich (he): if we stick in a typical.

143
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.810
David Schaich (he): we're gonna how we got this number 10 to the power 23 that we have.

144
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.000
David Schaich (he): the that the entropy is

145
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:32.770
David Schaich (he): between me and the power 23 it to the power 23.

146
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.590
David Schaich (he): We got an advances about 50 So this is

147
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:42.740
David Schaich (he): a battle that has a relevant precision of better than one part in 10 to the twentieth.

148
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.000
David Schaich (he): So, Basically, asymptotically.

149
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:52.380
David Schaich (he): you can see that the entropy is simply equal. and 23

150
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.920
David Schaich (he): for practical purposes.

151
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.480
David Schaich (he): So this is tutorial on the lecture. So i'll stop talking soon. The you

152
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.090
David Schaich (he): activity that

153
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.910
David Schaich (he): is set up here for you to work with.

154
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:27.800
David Schaich (he): This is we statement to what we just went through is actually computing these bounds for this

155
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.960
David Schaich (he): same example that we

156
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:40.940
David Schaich (he): we've got previously 2 spin systems in thermal contacts. each with the same number of spins they and one and then 2 or 10,

157
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:47.320
David Schaich (he): a fixed number of the overall entropy between those sorry, the overall energy between those 2 subsystems

158
00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:57.410
David Schaich (he): here minus 10 in units where that external magnetic field has just a value of H. Equals one.

159
00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:02.870
David Schaich (he): so it can drop out of all the expressions. and it's not too hard to

160
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:11.590
David Schaich (he): numerically evaluate these bounds just by hand. It becomes a bit more

161
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:25.060
David Schaich (he): computationally intensive is, and increases going up to 10 or 20 or 30, and each subsystem with that fixed energy. and by well checking these bounds

162
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:37.510
David Schaich (he): and considering where the maximum terms are coming from. you will actually connect to one of the first things we were talking about here over time.

163
00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.020
David Schaich (he): showing how we can expect

164
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:47.710
David Schaich (he): spin systems to for any systems to evolve in time in only one direction.

165
00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:57.950
David Schaich (he): So we had the example of putting a drop of down to a bigger water. We expect that to the spread out we will see something analogous

166
00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:06.579
David Schaich (he): in this exercise. especially as. and becomes larger in the system. So

167
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:15.579
David Schaich (he): I will let you get on. With that pause the recording, and come back, and maybe 10 min to talk about the other activity that

168
00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.950
David Schaich (he): I have to work on either questions about this one before

169
00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:20.430
David Schaich (he): get up the way.

170
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:40.640
David Schaich (he): Maybe it's worth checking in for a few minutes to see. Yeah. we're on the right track.

171
00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.610
David Schaich (he): I switch back to

172
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.900
David Schaich (he): projector here.

173
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:54.120
David Schaich (he): You ask first, how many terms are you? Finding that some

174
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.880
David Schaich (he): accommodation or

175
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.370
David Schaich (he): minus 10,

176
00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.440
David Schaich (he): like I put on the board just behind me

177
00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.450
David Schaich (he): twice in the

178
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.640
David Schaich (he): honest. That total number so on him

179
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.860
David Schaich (he): equals 10. This can take

180
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.100
is

181
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.070
David Schaich (he): up to 10,

182
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:35.170
David Schaich (he): and if we want to distribute

183
00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:41.570
David Schaich (he): minus 10 units of energy among 2 subsystems

184
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.600
simply counts

185
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.580
David Schaich (he): number of different

186
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.300
David Schaich (he): ways. We can do that

187
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:57.170
David Schaich (he): criminal cases to have all of it the first subsystem

188
00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:01.020
David Schaich (he): and then 0 energy, the second

189
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.630
David Schaich (he): allowable values for it. the 10 min that we have in each.

190
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:19.750
David Schaich (he): And then we can the opposite situation where all the energy in zoom. the other subsystem. And then there are it's 4 or 2 cases

191
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:21.570
David Schaich (he): totally

192
00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.250
between

193
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.460
David Schaich (he): those 2 extremes.

194
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.330
David Schaich (he): It's visible, and

195
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.160
David Schaich (he): from the

196
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.930
David Schaich (he): connect this to the

197
00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.750
David Schaich (he): number of

198
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.590
David Schaich (he): so the energy is minus 10,

199
00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:51.500
David Schaich (he): then every single one of the

200
00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.050
David Schaich (he): so.

201
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.900
David Schaich (he): Yes.

202
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:10.020
David Schaich (he): 10 up and 20 spins in those 2 cases to get the energy of 0 oh, 2 and minus 10 to 0, and and is 5

203
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.380
David Schaich (he): and so.

204
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.360
David Schaich (he): and not to

205
00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:33.490
David Schaich (he): contributions to the sum, is the product of the microstates in each of these 2 subsystems.

206
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.170
David Schaich (he): So the number of microstates, if we have

207
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:46.600
David Schaich (he): and spins all which have to be pointing upward. it's just one possibility there

208
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:50.000
David Schaich (he): possible

209
00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.870
David Schaich (he): is Well. we have choosing those 5 over 20 space out there.

210
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.490
David Schaich (he): which is one times deal.

211
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.550
David Schaich (he): I know your coefficients

212
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.230
David Schaich (he): in factorial time, 6 over

213
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.060
David Schaich (he): so

214
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.880
David Schaich (he): 3 and 2 cancel up with 6, 5, and 4,

215
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:27.150
you see

216
00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:32.010
David Schaich (he): 10. It's both to 2.

217
00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:34.890
David Schaich (he): So overall this is

218
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:43.260
David Schaich (he): 4 times 7 6 5 9 times 7,

219
00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.630
David Schaich (he): 63.

220
00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:48.640
It is

221
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.790
David Schaich (he): 2, 52. We have 12 and 240,

222
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.930
David Schaich (he): so there are 250

223
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:59.160
David Schaich (he): micro face in the cell from this first term

224
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.440
David Schaich (he): the same number of yeah.

225
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:09.640
David Schaich (he): obviously configuration, where the values of the energy and the other pointing to the same, which is solved between those 2 cell systems

226
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.650
David Schaich (he): there, too.

227
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:14.990
David Schaich (he): Consider it

228
00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.630
David Schaich (he): around the middle. where there's even distribution of

229
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.430
David Schaich (he): yeah.

230
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:30.610
David Schaich (he): yeah.

231
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.220
David Schaich (he): 10 shoes 8 times.

232
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.750
David Schaich (he): and she's 7,

233
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.730
David Schaich (he): the 10

234
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.410
David Schaich (he): over to

235
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.210
things.

236
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.320
David Schaich (he): That is.

237
00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:57.840
David Schaich (he): we have

238
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.120
David Schaich (he): 5 times 9 is 45,

239
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:05.960
David Schaich (he): you know.

240
00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:12.420
David Schaich (he): 2 can cancel up and 9, so it's 3 times, 4, it's 12 times 10.

241
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.060
David Schaich (he): Yeah, that that is a

242
00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.710
David Schaich (he): larger number by about a factor of 20 compared to

243
00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.360
David Schaich (he): the case of all the energy in one subsystem

244
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.570
David Schaich (he): or the other.

245
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.860
David Schaich (he): Practically look at

246
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.780
David Schaich (he): 5,400.

247
00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.610
Be this exercise.

248
00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.030
David Schaich (he): evaluating the sum

249
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.840
David Schaich (he): in total.

250
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:57.730
David Schaich (he): gives us the entropy which turns out to be just to know

251
00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.870
David Schaich (he): 10% larger than

252
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:13.820
David Schaich (he): what we would estimate. Just from this we just turned into some that comes from the with symmetric distribution between those 2 different subsystems.

253
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.930
David Schaich (he): and what you will see, as you

254
00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.940
David Schaich (he): go through

255
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:28.420
David Schaich (he): the more elaborate exercises for larger numbers of spins approaching the so called thermodynamic limit, where we

256
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.340
we have

257
00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.040
David Schaich (he): 10 to the 23 degrees of freedom

258
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.620
David Schaich (he): is that

259
00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.640
the ratio between

260
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:49.670
David Schaich (he): the largest and smallest terms in this zone in this case at 5,400 is

261
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:52.090
David Schaich (he): something like

262
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.650
David Schaich (he): 20 times larger than the case in which all the interview

263
00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.360
David Schaich (he): is. and those 2 subsystems.

264
00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.560
David Schaich (he): So we were to look at

265
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.130
David Schaich (he): this combined system with just

266
00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:13.130
David Schaich (he): 10 plus 10 particles as it involves in the time

267
00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.580
David Schaich (he): you would expect to see

268
00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.680
David Schaich (he): that even distribution

269
00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.390
David Schaich (he): of spins

270
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:37.120
David Schaich (he): across the 2. So we started off with all of the energy in one system or the other, and looked at the system again. A little while later

271
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:42.640
David Schaich (he): there is a high probability that we would see those spins more evenly distributed.

272
00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:50.500
David Schaich (he): diffuse outward rather than all the clustered in one subsystem or the other.

273
00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.660
David Schaich (he): and come personally, if we were to start with.

274
00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:05.790
David Schaich (he): but not expected to all clump on one side or the other. just because there are many fewer microstates.

275
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:16.280
David Schaich (he): That's I'll respond to that. Each of those microstates has even has the same probability in thermodynamic equilibrium.

276
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.130
David Schaich (he): Yes, you all right.

277
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:25.420
David Schaich (he): Sorry about him too quickly. Thanks for that

278
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.550
David Schaich (he): correction. And then you know

279
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:33.540
David Schaich (he): what I just described. It's what we call

280
00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.490
David Schaich (he): of this module, the arrow of time. How

281
00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:53.940
David Schaich (he): we can expect initial state that is, unbalanced or balance system. but not the other way around. That's the exactly the same consideration to

282
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:57.810
David Schaich (he): in the

283
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.750
David Schaich (he): illustration of dialing the using through

284
00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:09.850
David Schaich (he): a beaker of water that we also looked at. This is the.

285
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.610
David Schaich (he): and she would have everyday illustration of this. So last

286
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.350
David Schaich (he): 500 of the tutorial. Let's introduce the

287
00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:25.050
David Schaich (he): other activity. That is

288
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:26.620
David Schaich (he): so. We've seen that

289
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.760
David Schaich (he): already. And with you

290
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.720
David Schaich (he): explore the

291
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.010
David Schaich (he): almost

292
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.140
David Schaich (he): used a few times in the lecture

293
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.500
David Schaich (he): and before

294
00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.400
David Schaich (he): it's approximately.

295
00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.900
David Schaich (he): and then

296
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.280
David Schaich (he): exponential or both size.

297
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:03.960
Okay.

298
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:10.390
David Schaich (he): But as you will be in

299
00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:15.770
David Schaich (he): which is

300
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.360
David Schaich (he): through the power. And

301
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:24.540
David Schaich (he): so that's the an approximation that we've been using. We're in device.

302
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:31.860
David Schaich (he): smooth, continuous, and differential approximations to the factorial. Function.

303
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.710
David Schaich (he): And there is a

304
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.550
David Schaich (he): more precise

305
00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.770
David Schaich (he): for this approximation in the form

306
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.980
David Schaich (he): a power series

307
00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.640
pre-factor

308
00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:59.270
David Schaich (he): So we have the end over ease with how it end factor that we're used to.

309
00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:03.730
David Schaich (he): we can bring in actually a

310
00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:09.580
David Schaich (he): a series of smaller and smaller corrections

311
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:13.410
David Schaich (he): suppressed by a power zone.

312
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:16.040
David Schaich (he): This

313
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:39.190
David Schaich (he): one interesting thing about this series is that it's actually what's called an asymptotic series. which is the statement that it has a vanishing radius of convergence. We' to sum up the infinitely many terms in the series that we always

314
00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:42.250
David Schaich (he): diverge. If we were to truncate

315
00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:48.800
David Schaich (he): the series at the appropriate order, and we can get very accurate

316
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:55.890
David Schaich (he): approximation, which is something that you can explore. Video activity for you to

317
00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.220
David Schaich (he): do is actually to derive this in a few stages.

318
00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.720
David Schaich (he): First stage is the simplest

319
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.160
David Schaich (he): where

320
00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.480
David Schaich (he): it's not too hard to

321
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:20.590
David Schaich (he): i'm sure it is

322
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.100
David Schaich (he): greater than the minus N. So the corrections for the

323
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:30.160
David Schaich (he): our usual way of looking at this not necessarily positive.

324
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.350
David Schaich (he): and it's even easier to show that it is

325
00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.100
David Schaich (he): less than

326
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.500
David Schaich (he): the first letter.

327
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:54.070
David Schaich (he): and this it's us to the standard for all we have been using.

328
00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:00.370
David Schaich (he): Give you a second pass through the analysis and

329
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.750
David Schaich (he): provide that

330
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:05.060
David Schaich (he): pre-factor.

331
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:09.600
David Schaich (he): Sure it is approximately

332
00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:11.620
David Schaich (he): to I

333
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:17.290
David Schaich (he): and over e to the end. So that's that first term in the series.

334
00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:23.090
David Schaich (he): There are many ways to derive all of these panels.

335
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:32.950
David Schaich (he): If you need a way of approaching this approximation is to

336
00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.860
sure

337
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:46.350
David Schaich (he): in factorial. it is given. My. So call you get to grow up to the power in

338
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:50.390
David Schaich (he): E to the call minus X integrated from 0 to infinity

339
00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:55.470
David Schaich (he): approximate.

340
00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.520
David Schaich (he): Yeah, it's a great

341
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:07.840
David Schaich (he): as a so exactly. And then do you?

342
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.290
David Schaich (he): Third stage

343
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:14.800
David Schaich (he): of the activity is to

344
00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:19.000
David Schaich (he): compute

345
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:27.610
David Schaich (he): some of the power suppressed corrections to that leaving term. So that's cool AV: and so on.

346
00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:29.490
David Schaich (he): Where

347
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:38.210
David Schaich (he): get there, anyway? So doing this. the first one is to compare

348
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:45.200
David Schaich (he): the approximations that we would have for in factorial

349
00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:50.420
David Schaich (he): compared to. and

350
00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:52.480
of the

351
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.870
David Schaich (he): in factorial.

352
00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.820
David Schaich (he): so

353
00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:02.420
David Schaich (he): takes us to the end of time for today, and gives you something to

354
00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.540
David Schaich (he): play with over the coming week.

355
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:10.350
David Schaich (he): which is also

356
00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.330
David Schaich (he): on canvas. I can

357
00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:17.540
David Schaich (he): zoom out there and zoom in here

358
00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:28.740
David Schaich (he): a few more comments about each of these free analyses, and in particular the way which this euler integral

359
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.670
David Schaich (he): can be approximated by Hey Gaussian?

360
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:42.650
David Schaich (he): I'll leave you with that for today. Questions about either of the

361
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:47.790
David Schaich (he): the entropy of 4. It's the setup for driving

362
00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.530
David Schaich (he): several levels of

363
00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.470
David Schaich (he): And what?

364
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:07.860
David Schaich (he): Yeah. So the number of microstates is the number of ways that we

365
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:13.850
David Schaich (he): and arrange. and plus of the total number and particles to be

366
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.429
David Schaich (he): directly in that direction.

367
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:24.050
David Schaich (he): So 2 of us

368
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.179
Okay.

369
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:33.909
David Schaich (he): So yeah, 2. And plus one is the total energy

370
00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:36.590
you think about the way. So here.

371
00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:40.060
David Schaich (he): in this example on the board, so.

372
00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:43.409
David Schaich (he): looking at the projected notes, we have

373
00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:50.679
David Schaich (he): a single sorry we have 3 upper. I would

374
00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.590
David Schaich (he): instead of 4. And there are

375
00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.730
David Schaich (he): 4 different ways that we could have that.

376
00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.270
David Schaich (he): So that factor of 4 is counting the number of

377
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.550
David Schaich (he): positions that we can choose

378
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:26.540
David Schaich (he): by coefficients

379
00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:34.740
David Schaich (he): choosing 3 of the 4 students to be pointing out for. and then that gives those factors of.

380
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.320
David Schaich (he): So.

381
00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:53.610
David Schaich (he): seeing that if there any remaining questions. What? I'm off to office hours now. Looks like they're early people showing up in the whole, so I will

382
00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:57.770
David Schaich (he): shut things down and see you again

383
00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:04.370
David Schaich (he): Monday morning. We will make you so. Some of those downs on the

384
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.550
David Schaich (he): entropy that we have.

385
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:08.530
David Schaich (he): and exploring.
