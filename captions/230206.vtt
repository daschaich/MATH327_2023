1
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.810
David Schaich (he): All right, that should be the recording in progress.

2
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.100
David Schaich (he): We'll get under way on another Monday morning.

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.280
David Schaich (he): Funny how

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.630
David Schaich (he): the focus is out...

5
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.090
David Schaich (he): I was just going to say it felt

6
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.810
David Schaich (he): very chilly to me this morning aftre a mild weekend.

7
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.549
David Schaich (he): Maybe just

8
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.740
David Schaich (he): my psychology. But let's

9
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.430
David Schaich (he): quickly get going with the six-digit code for today: 2 2 1

10
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.540
David Schaich (he): 6 7 0.

11
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.930
David Schaich (he): And a quick reminder of what we got through last Tuesday. It's been a while now

12
00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.660
David Schaich (he): since we looked at two fairly central results from probability theory that

13
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.320
David Schaich (he): go a long way to explaining the power of statistical physics.

14
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:18.850
David Schaich (he): Law of large numbers. We expressed as the statement that the arithmetic mean of

15
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.930
David Schaich (he): some outcome in our outcome set from the experiment that is repeated

16
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:36.070
David Schaich (he): some large number of times. The capital are each experiment. It's approximately the mean of the corresponding probability space for which these

17
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.760
David Schaich (he): experiments are drawn or defined.

18
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.530
David Schaich (he): at least that approximation becomes

19
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.200
David Schaich (he): better and better for the large number of repetitions.

20
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.170
David Schaich (he): and are much greater than one. and they similar

21
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.050
David Schaich (he): by any other.

22
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.330
David Schaich (he): The central.

23
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.060
David Schaich (he): the links, the collective behavior in the form of the probability distribution

24
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.350
David Schaich (he): for

25
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.990
David Schaich (he): some coordinate that depends on a large number of identical and identical or independence, and identically distributed

26
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.590
David Schaich (he): random numbers.

27
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.700
David Schaich (he): This probability distribution is expressed simply as the Gaussian function

28
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.560
David Schaich (he): that it depends

29
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.750
David Schaich (he): on the

30
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.860
David Schaich (he): mean and variance you and Sigma Square

31
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.640
David Schaich (he): of each individual

32
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.650
David Schaich (he): degree of free. Let me train a variable or

33
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.710
David Schaich (he): repetition of the experiments in question.

34
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.840
David Schaich (he): So

35
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.400
David Schaich (he): this is a deceptively powerful

36
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.010
David Schaich (he): result that we can get

37
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:20.020
David Schaich (he): information about the large scale behavior of many particles, just from the defining features of a single one, and the probability distribution that governs it, its behavior.

38
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.710
David Schaich (he): or with that me

39
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.440
David Schaich (he): you and variance Sigma squared

40
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.530
David Schaich (he): just for a single degree of freedom.

41
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.300
David Schaich (he): So are there any

42
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.200
David Schaich (he): questions about that before we go ahead.

43
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.140
David Schaich (he): The plan for

44
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.000
David Schaich (he): this week.

45
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.290
David Schaich (he): So today

46
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:54.160
David Schaich (he): i'll be looking at that, you know. Bring the walks and a fusion. and this will look

47
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.350
David Schaich (he): quite similar to the tutorial activity we had on Thursday.

48
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.170
David Schaich (he): which turns out we can interpret as a particular random walk. We'll generalize that today and connect that

49
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.580
David Schaich (he): to the central limit theorem.

50
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.110
David Schaich (he): and quite possibly then move on to

51
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:23.770
David Schaich (he): concepts of statistical ensembles. and the more dynamic equilibrium depending on how things go.

52
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.790
David Schaich (he): And then tomorrow rather than another lesson with the tutorial. On Thursday

53
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:40.090
David Schaich (he): we switch over to a computer lab an opportunity for you to work on that computer project, and we'll spend at least some of the time tomorrow, talking through some of the background information in that project.

54
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.200
David Schaich (he): as well as some of the basics of Python, just for the benefit of those of you who

55
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.920
David Schaich (he): are not coming into this with a background in programming which you don't need to.

56
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.120
David Schaich (he): So, starting off with

57
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.230
David Schaich (he): the idea of a random walk.

58
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.390
David Schaich (he): This is

59
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.460
David Schaich (he): hey. deceptively general and powerful

60
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.730
David Schaich (he): modeling tool, and I may have mentioned last week that it

61
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.660
David Schaich (he): is essentially what's going on in rounding in motion

62
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.510
David Schaich (he): mentioned is for the definitive proof that as the molecules exist. as well as

63
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.320
David Schaich (he): various other applications in

64
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.380
David Schaich (he): various different spaces, so the tutorial activity With that

65
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.810
David Schaich (he): game could be considered a random walk in money space.

66
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:53.580
David Schaich (he): the process of genetic drift. It's a random walk in the space of DNA sequences

67
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.770
David Schaich (he): and stock prices have elements of

68
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.710
David Schaich (he): we in the walks

69
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.480
David Schaich (he): in more financial contexts, which

70
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.810
David Schaich (he): some of you may well have seen depending on what modules you've taken from this department.

71
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.640
David Schaich (he): Basic idea is, we have some objects.

72
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.330
David Schaich (he): and at points in time this object

73
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.460
David Schaich (he): takes

74
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.240
David Schaich (he): some step. It has it changes in some way at this position on their property

75
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.520
David Schaich (he): with some. I wanted to brandon this.

76
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.180
David Schaich (he): So if we talk just

77
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.710
David Schaich (he): and so we have an object that is indeed stepping in physical space. It starts from

78
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.310
David Schaich (he): a current position.

79
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.320
David Schaich (he): and from that position that ran step takes it to

80
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.120
David Schaich (he): some new position, or, more generally, these positions can be

81
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.490
David Schaich (he): state

82
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.010
David Schaich (he): in Asia

83
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.850
David Schaich (he): abstract space.

84
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:56.950
David Schaich (he): This.

85
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.710
David Schaich (he): I should say, just in passing, is an example of what is called

86
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.110
David Schaich (he): i'm. More off process.

87
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.220
David Schaich (he): which is, that

88
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.910
David Schaich (he): the behavior of the object. The step that it takes

89
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:22.080
David Schaich (he): depends only on that it's or connects only its current position to its new position. So it starts from some States

90
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.220
David Schaich (he): takes a random step to a new State.

91
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:31.770
David Schaich (he): And then

92
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.300
David Schaich (he): the yeah

93
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.870
David Schaich (he): absence of any memory effects is sort of the defining feature of a Markov process.

94
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:49.740
David Schaich (he): The evolution of a State, from its current value to its new position.

95
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.980
David Schaich (he): depends only on

96
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:59.110
David Schaich (he): this single random step, and the sequence of states or positions

97
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.760
David Schaich (he): that's comes out of this process is known as

98
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.740
David Schaich (he): a Markov chain.

99
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:17.550
David Schaich (he): the idea being that each states in this chain is only linked to the one that came immediately before the one that comes to the after, with

100
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.460
David Schaich (he): no need to

101
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.460
David Schaich (he): account for or no ability to incorporate any information about

102
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.400
David Schaich (he): the past history. Oh. the system.

103
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:35.909
David Schaich (he): and this is something that we will come back around to toward the end of the module. In the 10

104
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.350
David Schaich (he): we'll look at Markov chains in more detail, which is

105
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.429
David Schaich (he): the main motivation for mentioning the here

106
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.360
David Schaich (he): going to some details about random loss

107
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.390
David Schaich (he): specialized to

108
00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:05.190
David Schaich (he): just a simple example of that may be able to recognize as a slight generalization of

109
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:11.330
David Schaich (he): that roulette game you look at in this tutorial. We'll make 3 simplifying assumptions

110
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.570
David Schaich (he): for the random walk. First, that

111
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.940
David Schaich (he): you will actually have something walking just

112
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:26.060
David Schaich (he): in one dimension. So a an object, a walker that can step either

113
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.000
David Schaich (he): to the right online. we'll call that

114
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.420
David Schaich (he): the positive direction.

115
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.170
David Schaich (he): and this step to the right.

116
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.330
David Schaich (he): or alternately, the water can

117
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.410
David Schaich (he): take a step to the left.

118
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.320
David Schaich (he): These the only 2 possibilities. the probability for

119
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.130
David Schaich (he): walking to the

120
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.490
David Schaich (he): left.

121
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:08.820
David Schaich (he): Q. Has to be one minus P. So that the probabilities for those.

122
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:16.200
David Schaich (he): the sum of the probabilities over all possible steps as up to a 100% as probabilities. Most

123
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.260
David Schaich (he): without loss of generality, we can

124
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.950
David Schaich (he): well.

125
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.690
David Schaich (he): with some loss of generality we will fix the length of each step

126
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.260
David Schaich (he): that the water takes in this

127
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:38.270
David Schaich (he): one dimension. Stepping out it to the right, we're left with that. In generality we can fix the value

128
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:43.750
David Schaich (he): of that fixed step like just to be one equivalent to working in units of

129
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.770
David Schaich (he): steps.

130
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:50.930
David Schaich (he): going to the left or the right and the file simplification.

131
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.740
David Schaich (he): We'll see that each step

132
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.070
David Schaich (he): occurs at a regular time

133
00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.510
David Schaich (he): interval. Call that delta t.

134
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.710
David Schaich (he): So

135
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:13.720
David Schaich (he): taking n steps in this walk will last some total time n times delta t.

136
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.560
David Schaich (he): So this

137
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.780
David Schaich (he): before going on to

138
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:32.380
David Schaich (he): deal with this example. I'll just say some of the ways we can appreciate. This is

139
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:45.770
David Schaich (he): simplifying. This is, if we think about Brownian motion that was eventually explained as a random walk of, say, a polling grain being bombarded by lots of water molecules in the fluid.

140
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.930
David Schaich (he): Each of the steps in that

141
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.460
David Schaich (he): that Brownian motion is resulting from some collision between

142
00:11:53.570 --> 00:12:00.350
David Schaich (he): a water molecule H. Twoo, and that pollen grain. Those are occurring at unpredictable times.

143
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:05.530
David Schaich (he): direct and unpredictable directions in the 2 dimensions

144
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:13.670
David Schaich (he): that that motion is pursuing, and the length that the polygrade is going to step from each of those collisions is going to

145
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.410
David Schaich (he): randomly fluctuates.

146
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.310
David Schaich (he): depending on

147
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:19.990
yeah

148
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.830
David Schaich (he): speed and angle with which the water molecule can large it. So

149
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.920
David Schaich (he): all 3 0f these

150
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:34.340
David Schaich (he): simplifications are lost. In that case, just why you need someone like I assign to to carry out the mathematics and actually predict

151
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.410
David Schaich (he): the observed behavior of Brownian motion model as this sort of random walk

152
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:42.270
but

153
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.640
David Schaich (he): one, that representative. What that we could consider

154
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.410
David Schaich (he): with our simplifying setup is.

155
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.610
David Schaich (he): say, step, step once to the left.

156
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.960
David Schaich (he): for all this represents this in.

157
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:11.670
David Schaich (he): and the stepping again. the right. left, right, and then maybe a couple of more steps to the right.

158
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.630
David Schaich (he): So if we

159
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:22.700
David Schaich (he): just count the number of steps in this walk we have n equals 6, and after stepping

160
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.740
David Schaich (he): left, right, left, right, right, right, with fixed step, lengths

161
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:33.310
David Schaich (he): the you step to the left, followed by the step to the right takes us back to the starting point.

162
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.530
David Schaich (he): We can just call X equals 0.

163
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:45.010
David Schaich (he): Repeat that left and right, and then the 2 steps to the right can take us to a final position.

164
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:47.850
David Schaich (he): X equals

165
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.430
David Schaich (he): plus 2, so the step to the right

166
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.510
David Schaich (he): is plus

167
00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.470
David Schaich (he): step to the left is minus one. I'm. A physician

168
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.180
David Schaich (he): next equals 2 from

169
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.250
David Schaich (he): defining the starting position to be 0.

170
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.880
David Schaich (he): So if we we were to

171
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.950
David Schaich (he): let's do that same.

172
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:17.340
David Schaich (he): what in the opposite direction.

173
00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:28.410
David Schaich (he): and we will get to X of negative 2 negative numbers just indicating that we're to the left of the starting position rather than the right. and we can

174
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:35.220
David Schaich (he): just quickly toss out the basic probability features of

175
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.010
David Schaich (he): this walk. So

176
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.770
David Schaich (he): similarly to what we look at in the tutorial, I'll ask you how many.

177
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.650
David Schaich (he): what's are there

178
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.080
David Schaich (he): all possible? It works with

179
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.940
David Schaich (he): this number of step, 6

180
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.400
David Schaich (he): simplifications that

181
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.750
David Schaich (he): you put in place 20 license.

182
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:58.620
David Schaich (he): I see some calculations being done. shout out what they are seeing.

183
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.830
David Schaich (he): Let's break it down. Then, for

184
00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.390
David Schaich (he): each of the steps that we take, there are

185
00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:01.690
David Schaich (he): 2 possible directions to go to the left or to the right. So with that first step

186
00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.560
David Schaich (he): there are 2 possible walks with a single step.

187
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:10.190
David Schaich (he): let me take the next step. It's independent of the one that came before. So there's another 2 possibilities going forward

188
00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.300
right?

189
00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:13.579
David Schaich (he): And that continues for

190
00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:17.510
David Schaich (he): the 10 steps that we take. You're 6,

191
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.750
David Schaich (he): which 248-16-3264.

192
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.369
David Schaich (he): It's a 64 possible steps.

193
00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:30.550
David Schaich (he): and you can talk about now, the probability of

194
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.420
David Schaich (he): any particular

195
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:39.680
David Schaich (he): step with the represent any any particular walk like a representative one that

196
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.340
David Schaich (he): we just wrote down

197
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:56.980
David Schaich (he): Anyone have.

198
00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.140
David Schaich (he): I guess, as to

199
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.820
David Schaich (he): what the probability for this particular

200
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:11.890
David Schaich (he): six-step walk is out of all of the possible 6 step walks, and 64 that we

201
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:14.360
David Schaich (he): just counting that.

202
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:43.000
Well.

203
00:18:48.610 --> 00:19:00.950
David Schaich (he): it is one over 64, if and only if the probability of stepping to the right is the same. It's probably going to accept me to the left. Q. Equals a half

204
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.250
David Schaich (he): in the more general case, that is still more general than

205
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:11.390
David Schaich (he): it could be. You know we simplify things. We still have this

206
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:20.060
David Schaich (he): free of this varying, freely varying probability. P. And Q. For stepping to the right and stepping to the left

207
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.350
with each step to be left.

208
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.350
David Schaich (he): You said that that occurs with the probability of queue.

209
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:36.960
David Schaich (he): he. for each step to the right. So the overall probability for

210
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:48.940
David Schaich (he): this step with Sorry, this walk, with 4 steps to be right and 2 to the left, as well 4 factors of probably for stepping right.

211
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:51.070
David Schaich (he): followed by

212
00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:56.630
David Schaich (he): along with 2 factors of the probability queue for step into the left.

213
00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.590
David Schaich (he): and it's plugging in.

214
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.230
David Schaich (he): I have 40 to those gives one over, 2 to the 6 0ne over 64.

215
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.380
David Schaich (he): But you know more. General, set up. This need not be

216
00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.670
David Schaich (he): the same, for all walks in a particular

217
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.020
David Schaich (he): at opposite walk, he's going to have

218
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:20.220
David Schaich (he): the opposite factors of P. And Q. Reducing the that same one over 64,

219
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:26.350
David Schaich (he): when the probability of stepping in each direction is equal.

220
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.020
David Schaich (he): But more generally

221
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.960
David Schaich (he): these are, our probability sets

222
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.090
David Schaich (he): could differ.

223
00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:33.830
David Schaich (he): So

224
00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:37.210
David Schaich (he): okay.

225
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.560
David Schaich (he): generic probability

226
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.590
David Schaich (he): 4.

227
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.330
David Schaich (he): And in stuff walk

228
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.160
if they

229
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:52.150
David Schaich (he): lowercase our steps

230
00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.300
David Schaich (he): to the right.

231
00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:04.750
David Schaich (he): So this our here stands for hopefully won't be confused with the earlier our we had for repetition.

232
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.470
David Schaich (he): you know we have. and minus our

233
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.030
David Schaich (he): steps to the left.

234
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.360
David Schaich (he): So you

235
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.560
David Schaich (he): probability for our step

236
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:20.900
is

237
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.150
David Schaich (he): our powers of P.

238
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.160
David Schaich (he): If you're on

239
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.160
the is a power in that

240
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:34.900
David Schaich (he): the label that we have. or politicians last week.

241
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:45.450
David Schaich (he): that 2, how is it? And minus our the cover, will be stepping right and left with each of those r and and minus our

242
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:47.850
David Schaich (he): steps.

243
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.030
David Schaich (he): So

244
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.360
David Schaich (he): continuing with the system and steps

245
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:05.820
David Schaich (he): in total, with R to the right and minus art and left.

246
00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.240
David Schaich (he): What we will be interested in

247
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.370
David Schaich (he): computing

248
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.030
David Schaich (he): is the

249
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.590
David Schaich (he): expectation, value or just the expected

250
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.150
David Schaich (he): final position

251
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.410
David Schaich (he): for the walker after

252
00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:29.610
David Schaich (he): the schedule completes expectation value for that X,

253
00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.360
David Schaich (he): as well as

254
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.590
David Schaich (he): the

255
00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.950
David Schaich (he): analog of the variance. I try to reserve that term, for

256
00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.140
David Schaich (he): It's a single step process, with the

257
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.490
David Schaich (he): difference between

258
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:48.650
David Schaich (he): this expectation value of the square, of the final position

259
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:52.930
and the square of the expectation value of the final position.

260
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.790
David Schaich (he): This gives

261
00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:02.180
David Schaich (he): some measure of the fluctuations that we could expect

262
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:14.850
David Schaich (he): around the final position of a walk if we were to repeat that walk many times, all starting from the same starting point, and with the same probabilities which is relevant if we consider many particles

263
00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.400
David Schaich (he): and say that

264
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.770
David Schaich (he): behavior, each particle is being considered a repetition.

265
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:26.380
David Schaich (he): All that the process that each single one is going under, so

266
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.720
David Schaich (he): any particles undergoing many random walks.

267
00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:38.400
David Schaich (he): I'll be interested both in the expected final position of all those particles, as well as how much each individual.

268
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.630
David Schaich (he): they will fluctuate around that expectation.

269
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.270
David Schaich (he): So

270
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.860
David Schaich (he): building on what we saw above

271
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.630
David Schaich (he): the

272
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.440
David Schaich (he): it's the final position of

273
00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.720
David Schaich (he): these end. Step walks with and steps to the right

274
00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:02.930
David Schaich (he): is just going to be

275
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:04.920
the

276
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.890
David Schaich (he): displacement that we take to the right each of those

277
00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.200
David Schaich (he): our steps out of the total in

278
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.320
David Schaich (he): plus the negative one displacements to the right.

279
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.360
David Schaich (he): with the remaining and minus ourselves.

280
00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:24.680
David Schaich (he): which is 2 R. Minus n.

281
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:27.620
which.

282
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.520
David Schaich (he): because our itself

283
00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.320
David Schaich (he): can only range from 0 to N. Either we

284
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:39.160
David Schaich (he): take all steps to the left. We take all steps to the right, or we have something

285
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.610
in the middle. Yes.

286
00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:48.700
David Schaich (he): the stress. the range of final positions that we can have for a given number of steps.

287
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:57.970
David Schaich (he): and because we have fixed the the size of each step to be the same, plus and minus one.

288
00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:00.490
David Schaich (he): We can equivalent later.

289
00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:05.200
David Schaich (he): Talk about either the probability of ending up at a particular

290
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.670
David Schaich (he): I know position

291
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.000
David Schaich (he): or the probability. Oh.

292
00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.870
David Schaich (he): taking ourselves out of this, and

293
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:19.120
David Schaich (he): by Sh!

294
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:24.210
David Schaich (he): I will take advantage of this here and now to we focus on

295
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:31.740
David Schaich (he): P. Of R, which is a bit easier to handle along the lines of what we did last week.

296
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.770
David Schaich (he): I will built

297
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.920
at this only holds

298
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.910
David Schaich (he): because of our

299
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.280
David Schaich (he): 50 step. Size

300
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.390
David Schaich (he): is fixed, and we've set it t0 0ne.

301
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.340
David Schaich (he): This is not

302
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:59.100
David Schaich (he): for some distribution.

303
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:12.210
David Schaich (he): Let's see what I can have on the projector at the same time. So

304
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:22.200
David Schaich (he): because

305
00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.970
David Schaich (he): the final position

306
00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.290
David Schaich (he): isn't sensitive to the order

307
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:36.320
David Schaich (he): which the steps are taken. There are

308
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:44.760
David Schaich (he): depending on what that final position is various different numbers of ways to

309
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.230
David Schaich (he): reach it.

310
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.660
This just one example. To

311
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.140
David Schaich (he): illustrate this.

312
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.150
David Schaich (he): let me ask you

313
00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:02.190
David Schaich (he): if we have those same 6 6 steps that we started off with.

314
00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:12.650
David Schaich (he): How many ways would there be to reach that final position.

315
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:16.360
David Schaich (he): X equals 4 from 6 step walks.

316
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.320
Thanks.

317
00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:01.600
David Schaich (he): That is exactly the number that there are in the

318
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.640
David Schaich (he): easy way to see that is

319
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:09.540
David Schaich (he): by changing that variable from the final position X.

320
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.600
David Schaich (he): That number of steps to the right that we would need

321
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:14.840
to get to X equals 4.

322
00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.850
David Schaich (he): Rearranging this relation

323
00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:20.950
David Schaich (he): we have.

324
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.720
David Schaich (he): and our is one half

325
00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.070
of the sum

326
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:29.650
David Schaich (he): of X and N. In this case 4 plus 6 is 10 0ver, 2 is 5.

327
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:35.740
David Schaich (he): S0 0ut of a 6 step walk we need 5 steps to the right. and there are

328
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:38.060
David Schaich (he): 6 ways to do that.

329
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.450
David Schaich (he): and that can either be the first step, or the second step

330
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:50.520
David Schaich (he): on the third step, and s0 0n.

331
00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.940
David Schaich (he): 3 6.

332
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.340
David Schaich (he): Here

333
00:28:55.860 --> 00:29:00.940
David Schaich (he): it's coming from the corresponding binomial coefficients, 6 choose 5,

334
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.170
David Schaich (he): which in general

335
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:07.540
David Schaich (he): is the total number of steps, and choosing

336
00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:10.500
David Schaich (he): the number of steps are to the right.

337
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.320
David Schaich (he): So with

338
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:24.110
David Schaich (he): that's factor for the number of possible ways to end up at X equals 4,

339
00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:31.500
David Schaich (he): the overall probability, 4 0r 6 that walk to end up in X equals 4, which is equal.

340
00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.460
The probability of taking it

341
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:45.530
David Schaich (he): 5 steps to the right. we have the probability of stepping to the right risk. In the fifth hour we have the probability of step into the left just once.

342
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:51.680
David Schaich (he): Then we have 6 possible permutations of those steps that all needs to be accounted for.

343
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.350
David Schaich (he): and that

344
00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:02.450
David Schaich (he): general probability piece of R.

345
00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.030
David Schaich (he): It's just expressed in terms of

346
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.660
David Schaich (he): multiply it by

347
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.050
yes.

348
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:17.300
David Schaich (he): probability we had earlier for a single instead walk

349
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:19.870
David Schaich (he): with our steps to the right.

350
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.840
David Schaich (he): So with that

351
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:45.340
David Schaich (he): example clarifying things you can. Shelby, and and look at the expected value for that final position which

352
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:49.330
David Schaich (he): the definition of expectation value we had last week. We know

353
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.890
David Schaich (he): this is some

354
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:59.170
David Schaich (he): over all possible file positions that we have as outcomes in our outcome sets

355
00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:12.270
David Schaich (he): of that final position waited by the final position itself. Yeah, the thanks to you. connection between the final position and the number of steps to the right.

356
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:13.930
David Schaich (he): You can

357
00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:23.880
David Schaich (he): recast this as the sum over all possible number of steps to the right from 0 to end for an instant. Walk

358
00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:32.980
David Schaich (he): Hex is t0 0ur minus n. and then the probability taking our steps to the right.

359
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.990
David Schaich (he): the sum is up in your operation.

360
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:39.210
Yes.

361
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:43.910
David Schaich (he): which is why the expectation volume as a whole is. and pull out

362
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:47.770
David Schaich (he): a factor of 2 at the sum of our times.

363
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.100
David Schaich (he): P. Of R.

364
00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.360
You

365
00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.530
David Schaich (he): value of all the times. Probability for

366
00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:59.190
David Schaich (he): each possible outcome in the set gives the expectation value.

367
00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:14.470
David Schaich (he): Oh. the or the expected value of the number of steps that we take for the right. it will be only that factor of minus N. Out of the sum we just have the sum over all the probabilities, which, because they are probabilities.

368
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:15.890
David Schaich (he): just add up t0 0ne.

369
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.700
David Schaich (he): I can totally

370
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.090
David Schaich (he): the the expected value

371
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:25.420
David Schaich (he): of the square of the final position. 2

372
00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:30.230
David Schaich (he): expressions

373
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:36.770
David Schaich (he): related to the number of steps to the right. You just have to square the X that shows up in the sum

374
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:42.780
David Schaich (he): and expanding that we have

375
00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.960
David Schaich (he): account of 4 times r squared

376
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.120
David Schaich (he): within my piece of our

377
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:52.640
yeah

378
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:57.280
David Schaich (he): constant value of the constant factor minus 4 n that comes out of the sum.

379
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:03.730
David Schaich (he): It's an all if you are just giving the expectation down just to all. and then

380
00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:06.300
David Schaich (he): a plus n squared at the end.

381
00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:08.840
David Schaich (he): So

382
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.710
David Schaich (he): our goal of

383
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:18.660
David Schaich (he): analyzing the final position and the fluctuations of these random walks, has now

384
00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:25.960
David Schaich (he): computing the expectation values of R. And R. Squared

385
00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.590
David Schaich (he): the number of steps to the right, out of total

386
00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:32.070
David Schaich (he): and

387
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.620
David Schaich (he): useful trick. To do what

388
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.250
David Schaich (he): this sort of thing which you may have seen previously

389
00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:51.780
David Schaich (he): is. you find what's known as a generating function which is called that because it generates these

390
00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:59.020
David Schaich (he): these targets, the expectation values of our to some power

391
00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:00.860
David Schaich (he): is this

392
00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:04.450
David Schaich (he): something that sounds familiar, or something that's brand new

393
00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.710
David Schaich (he): shaking heads means

394
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:17.239
David Schaich (he): you, I suspect. So let's go through this.

395
00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:20.880
David Schaich (he): It's some share

396
00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:23.909
David Schaich (he): generating function

397
00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:28.389
David Schaich (he): will be a function of this parameter Pheno.

398
00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.199
and

399
00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:32.949
David Schaich (he): it will involve

400
00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:39.239
David Schaich (he): the sum over. All possible steps to the right are from 0 to N.

401
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.020
David Schaich (he): It will involve the probability.

402
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.929
David Schaich (he): Stepping to the right.

403
00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:50.699
David Schaich (he): as we should expect. We're looking at expectation values of our.

404
00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.659
David Schaich (he): And then what goes in that? Some

405
00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:57.890
David Schaich (he): is the exponential of our times data.

406
00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.470
David Schaich (he): So this is

407
00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:03.570
David Schaich (he): chosen so that when we set

408
00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:09.420
David Schaich (he): this new parameter the t0 0,

409
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:12.870
David Schaich (he): we get

410
00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:17.430
David Schaich (he): useful and interesting results.

411
00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:22.600
David Schaich (he): If we just look at the generating function itself.

412
00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:29.300
David Schaich (he): t of theta equals 0. One shout out what that would be equal to

413
00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.420
David Schaich (he): it is one we have.

414
00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:43.540
David Schaich (he): The sum over

415
00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:50.700
David Schaich (he): E to the 0 is one times the probabilities is the sub over capabilities which add up to a 100%.

416
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:56.840
David Schaich (he): What is useful is when we work at the derivative

417
00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:00.720
David Schaich (he): we're more useful than recovering 100%

418
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.770
David Schaich (he): behavior required by probability

419
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:09.710
David Schaich (he): and probability distributions. When we look at the derivatives

420
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:13.740
David Schaich (he): of this generating function, and after taking the derivative

421
00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:21.720
David Schaich (he): set, the t0 0. Well, the sum is, the linear operation derivative can go inside that

422
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:34.260
David Schaich (he): the derivative of even the art theater, with respect to Theta just bring this down. In fact, there are

423
00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:47.990
David Schaich (he): left as it was. Pr. Is independence of, theta and then setting theta t0 0

424
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:56.560
David Schaich (he): sets all of those exponential factors t0 0ne. So we get the sum over R. How it's our weighted by the probability

425
00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:57.980
alright.

426
00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:01.670
David Schaich (he): definition of the expectation value of our

427
00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:03.360
David Schaich (he): and this can be repeated

428
00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.310
David Schaich (he): some end number of times.

429
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.050
David Schaich (he): you know. to the

430
00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:14.560
David Schaich (he): Take n derivatives

431
00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.160
David Schaich (he): of the generating function

432
00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:27.950
David Schaich (he): with every derivative data is only showing up in the exponential factor. So we bring down our powers of end

433
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.370
David Schaich (he): to see you

434
00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:37.870
David Schaich (he): original expression in the some remaining.

435
00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:45.410
David Schaich (he): and we end up with the expectation value

436
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:47.910
David Schaich (he): of our to the power. And

437
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:54.400
David Schaich (he): so in the particular.

438
00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:59.390
David Schaich (he): the simple random walk that we're considering walking in one dimension

439
00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.260
David Schaich (he): with a fixed step length.

440
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:05.930
David Schaich (he): Our generating function

441
00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:19.670
David Schaich (he): just involves the general probability piece of our that'd be computed here minutes to go

442
00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:24.180
David Schaich (he): My

443
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:26.720
times.

444
00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:32.480
David Schaich (he): He powers the probability to step to the right of the Times, and then

445
00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:37.530
David Schaich (he): and minus our powers of the probability queue to step to the left

446
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:39.450
David Schaich (he): If we

447
00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:44.460
David Schaich (he): rearrange this. they suggested what.

448
00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:54.510
David Schaich (he): collecting together the 2 factors E to the theta and P. That are all raised to the our power.

449
00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:58.680
David Schaich (he): You have to be in line with all the left over.

450
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:01.620
David Schaich (he): and the sum over R from one to N.

451
00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:07.800
David Schaich (he): We can recognize or convince ourselves after the fact

452
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:08.750
David Schaich (he): that

453
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:21.660
David Schaich (he): this is just the sum e to the theta times p. Plus Q. Raised to the as power.

454
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:24.830
David Schaich (he): which is

455
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:32.370
David Schaich (he): the these powers of binomials are where binomial coefficients were originally

456
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:36.480
David Schaich (he): identified and discovered many centuries ago.

457
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.890
David Schaich (he): This is

458
00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.750
David Schaich (he): it's based on the

459
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:45.010
David Schaich (he): I know your formula.

460
00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:53.770
David Schaich (he): and plus b the end. It's the sum over I and she's I

461
00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.320
David Schaich (he): on the projector.

462
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:06.280
David Schaich (he): So it's easy to check again that

463
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:13.830
David Schaich (he): t of 0 is not just p plus Q. To the power in

464
00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:19.480
David Schaich (he): this, Into the theatre it comes. One p plus Q. We know, is one.

465
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:23.570
David Schaich (he): You know how we're in remains one.

466
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:26.100
David Schaich (he): and

467
00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:27.420
she's a

468
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.800
David Schaich (he): simple generating function to take derivatives.

469
00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.780
David Schaich (he): Oh.

470
00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:41.250
David Schaich (he): taking that derivative of

471
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:46.190
David Schaich (he): we have n minus one powers.

472
00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:46.950
Oh.

473
00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:48.790
David Schaich (he): I know we're meeting.

474
00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.110
David Schaich (he): I know the chain rule looks that

475
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:53.340
the

476
00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:01.810
David Schaich (he): derivative of the binomial itself, with respect to theta

477
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.570
David Schaich (he): which is just. you do the you know times that costing factor. P:

478
00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.660
David Schaich (he): We set it t0 0.

479
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:15.060
David Schaich (he): Yeah. this

480
00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:20.530
David Schaich (he): whole binomial goes away again becomes one reason power n minus one.

481
00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.220
David Schaich (he): We have n times one times one.

482
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:29.730
David Schaich (he): P. We have identified that as the expectation value.

483
00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.400
David Schaich (he): this R. The number of steps to the right given me.

484
00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:41.120
David Schaich (he): Probably this is P. And Q. That we have governing this random walk.

485
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.890
David Schaich (he): the

486
00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:50.140
David Schaich (he): second, derivative to get the expectation value r squared

487
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.440
David Schaich (he): is not much harder.

488
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:08.780
David Schaich (he): You can just start from the first derivative that we have.

489
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.370
David Schaich (he): and take another derivative of that.

490
00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.490
David Schaich (he): It's the easy

491
00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:21.170
David Schaich (he): way to start this with the derivative of the theta which is just. You do the theta

492
00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:22.790
David Schaich (he): So this first term

493
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:30.560
David Schaich (he): I actually rearrange things slightly

494
00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.030
David Schaich (he): up to the front

495
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:43.090
David Schaich (he): N. Minus one power that we need

496
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.480
David Schaich (he): from the product rule derivatives to the

497
00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:51.150
David Schaich (he): derivative of that I know what we have.

498
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.370
David Schaich (he): and n times the minus one

499
00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.660
David Schaich (he): just raised to the N. Minus 2 power, and we have another

500
00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:06.680
you to the theater

501
00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:08.840
David Schaich (he): he brought down

502
00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:12.000
David Schaich (he): from that.

503
00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.030
David Schaich (he): And we're setting the t0 0

504
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:24.950
David Schaich (he): in all of these terms. which simplifies things dramatically. How is that

505
00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.960
David Schaich (he): becomes one and one. So when N. Times P. Is left.

506
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:33.890
David Schaich (he): the second term we have.

507
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:39.420
David Schaich (he): and then we have and minus one yeah

508
00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:44.310
David Schaich (he): times, one times P. Times one plus one times. P. Again.

509
00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.970
David Schaich (he): So n times n minus one times P. Squared overall.

510
00:43:50.940 --> 00:44:00.840
David Schaich (he): which rearrange by it. pulling out an overall factor of and Mp. You have one

511
00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:03.050
David Schaich (he): plus

512
00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.170
David Schaich (he): a minus one times P. Or Np.

513
00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.920
David Schaich (he): Minus P.

514
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.240
David Schaich (he): And because one minus P. Equals Q.

515
00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.330
David Schaich (he): Can be written in this way.

516
00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:32.050
David Schaich (he): overall factor of N. Times. P. Times the sum of Np. Plus Q. And that. you know, phone

517
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:35.700
David Schaich (he): our work with the introducing, generating function

518
00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:40.400
David Schaich (he): is the expectation value of R squared.

519
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:41.510
So

520
00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:48.910
David Schaich (he): we are now ready to get a final result. The expected final position

521
00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:53.350
David Schaich (he): was twice the expected number of steps to provide

522
00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.420
David Schaich (he): minus N.

523
00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:57.750
See that

524
00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:02.720
David Schaich (he): expected that number of steps to the right was just N. Times P.

525
00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.290
David Schaich (he): So

526
00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.050
David Schaich (he): 2 Np. Minus N.

527
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.880
David Schaich (he): Can be written as N. Times

528
00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:16.320
David Schaich (he): the real factor of 2 P. Minus one

529
00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:24.170
David Schaich (he): the fluctuations around this final position you can buy it.

530
00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:32.080
David Schaich (he): The difference between the expected value to the square, the expected value of the square, minus the square of the expected value.

531
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:37.540
David Schaich (he): We have that

532
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:42.860
David Schaich (he): expectation. Value of X squared was

533
00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:46.990
David Schaich (he): 4 times the expected value of R squared.

534
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:54.410
David Schaich (he): Go ahead and rewrite that expression. Here i'll be back and forth.

535
00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:00.910
David Schaich (he): And then

536
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:08.560
David Schaich (he): the square of the expectation Wx was that

537
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:12.390
David Schaich (he): t0 0ur

538
00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.290
David Schaich (he): minus N. Square. So we are going to have

539
00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:19.780
David Schaich (he): expanding this to

540
00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:25.620
David Schaich (he): for r squared minus 4 in

541
00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:32.330
David Schaich (he): plus n squared if they have mine assigned.

542
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:35.700
David Schaich (he): See those cancel out.

543
00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.960
David Schaich (he): and

544
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:42.130
David Schaich (he): the minus 4 in our cancel out.

545
00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.820
David Schaich (he): We are left with

546
00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.370
David Schaich (he): 4 factors of

547
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.520
David Schaich (he): the expectation value of R squared

548
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.170
David Schaich (he): minus from here the the patient value

549
00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.330
David Schaich (he): all right.

550
00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:10.700
David Schaich (he): So the fluctuations and off the screen fluctuations in that's just related to the fluctuations in our

551
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.660
David Schaich (he): and plugging in what we computed for

552
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:19.150
David Schaich (he): these expectation values from the generating function we have

553
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:23.840
back to the 4

554
00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:25.220
David Schaich (he): times.

555
00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:40.790
David Schaich (he): Let me just distribute that product around

556
00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:43.780
David Schaich (he): n squared p squared

557
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.470
David Schaich (he): plus Mp. Queue

558
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:49.670
David Schaich (he): the expectation value r squared.

559
00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:55.800
David Schaich (he): It's attracting the square the expectation that we

560
00:47:57.210 --> 00:48:01.550
David Schaich (he): squaring that cancel that you end up with

561
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:05.440
David Schaich (he): for Np. Queue of the fluctuations

562
00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.370
David Schaich (he): of our walk around It's expected final position.

563
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.400
David Schaich (he): and just to

564
00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:14.850
David Schaich (he): check Dennis.

565
00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:17.030
David Schaich (he): These

566
00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.610
David Schaich (he): results are sensible.

567
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.470
David Schaich (he): We can consider some limiting cases.

568
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:25.980
David Schaich (he): so we

569
00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:31.080
David Schaich (he): look at the value for the probability of

570
00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:35.110
David Schaich (he): of 0. That means that we have

571
00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:40.330
David Schaich (he): no chance of taking a step to be right. Every single step has to be taken to the left.

572
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.720
David Schaich (he): Our expression for the

573
00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:54.780
David Schaich (he): expected final position X with P equals 0 is just minus N. Which is consistent with all of the steps being taken to the left

574
00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.040
David Schaich (he): and the

575
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:59.630
David Schaich (he): fluctuations around the final position

576
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:09.740
David Schaich (he): when P equals 0. Yes. also an easy one. Fluctuations are 0, which also makes sense.

577
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:14.470
David Schaich (he): That's with the 100% probability of taking every step to the left. There's

578
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:19.380
David Schaich (he): no way that conceptually it's probabilistically. Every single time. Repeat this more.

579
00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:23.950
David Schaich (he): you get exactly that same results for the final position. And

580
00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:29.840
David Schaich (he): similarly, in the other extreme. When we have a 100% chance of taking this, taking every step to the right.

581
00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.150
David Schaich (he): no chance of taking steps to the left.

582
00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:37.720
David Schaich (he): ours. file position and times

583
00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:43.520
David Schaich (he): on a position here and times 2 minus one

584
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:48.900
David Schaich (he): is, you know, positive, and we have no Q. One equals 0.

585
00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:51.220
David Schaich (he): So the fluctuations are still 0,

586
00:49:52.240 --> 00:50:02.430
David Schaich (he): and and also check that middle case. There's an equal probability of stepping to the right and left. and then equal, probably for all

587
00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:05.320
David Schaich (he): to the end walks that we would have

588
00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:08.300
David Schaich (he): the expected final value.

589
00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:11.740
David Schaich (he): Well, 2 times a half is one minus 1 0,

590
00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:17.820
David Schaich (he): and then the fluctuations now become non-zero.

591
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:20.540
David Schaich (he): both P. And Q. Equal a half.

592
00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.220
David Schaich (he): Multiply them together. They are a quarter

593
00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:26.760
David Schaich (he): and

594
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.960
David Schaich (he): the expected value.

595
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:30.200
David Schaich (he): I

596
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:34.430
David Schaich (he): the fluctuations is just n.

597
00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:37.070
David Schaich (he): Even though we can expect

598
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:44.460
David Schaich (he): any given wall to have it's highest probability. It's expected value for a final position of 0 and the starting point.

599
00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:53.080
David Schaich (he): and there's an equal probability of second to the left, into the right. The more steps that we take, the more these walks are able to spread out.

600
00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:55.940
David Schaich (he): or the fuse a random that

601
00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:07.140
David Schaich (he): expected final position. So this is a simple example of what turns out to be

602
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.710
a very general result. Let me see

603
00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.220
David Schaich (he): law of diffusion, which

604
00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:22.210
David Schaich (he): I think it an eye on the clock we should pick up after a brief break at the top of the hour. S0 0ther questions about

605
00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:24.990
David Schaich (he): the simple random walk that we've

606
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:28.030
David Schaich (he): gone through the first half of today.

607
00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:36.810
David Schaich (he): I'll pause. The recording, then give you some time to consider it, or to

608
00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:41.520
David Schaich (he): the recording is resumed as well, and

609
00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:43.520
David Schaich (he): we have.

610
00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:46.790
Yeah.

611
00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.520
David Schaich (he): you get the key to random walks.

612
00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:54.360
David Schaich (he): which is the to

613
00:51:56.710 --> 00:52:07.530
David Schaich (he): this concept of diffusion. I was saying this before the break about how the fluctuations of many walks around the expected value

614
00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:13.010
David Schaich (he): depend on the number of steps in the walk.

615
00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.800
David Schaich (he): So, even though

616
00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:24.920
David Schaich (he): there is a particular expected value As that walk is repeated. the different outcomes will spread out, or the fuse around that expected value.

617
00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:35.320
David Schaich (he): So this is indeed just the same sort of behavior that we saw it very beginning on the module.

618
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.930
David Schaich (he): describing that error of time back last week.

619
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:40.370
David Schaich (he): How

620
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:46.330
David Schaich (he): each of these molecules of dye are randomly walking through the beaker.

621
00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:49.500
spreading out their expected position or the fusing.

622
00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:54.700
David Schaich (he): It's all actually. they become constrained by the total amount of

623
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.990
David Schaich (he): volume available.

624
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:01.000
David Schaich (he): So i' to

625
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:09.400
David Schaich (he): approach to fusion and generalize the result that we had, for simple example, of a one-dimensional random walk with

626
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:12.570
David Schaich (he): fixed steps and fixed intervals.

627
00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:14.560
David Schaich (he): is to

628
00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:18.490
David Schaich (he): go back t0 0ur final expression for

629
00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:26.590
David Schaich (he): the expected value of the final position of the walk. and for the fluctuations around it. and

630
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:30.960
David Schaich (he): this to the

631
00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:33.540
David Schaich (he): full time that

632
00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:41.160
David Schaich (he): this lock required to take those end steps. So, with a fixed time interval between each step

633
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:48.190
David Schaich (he): we have the for the number of steps is that total time

634
00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:51.010
David Schaich (he): divided by the time interval.

635
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:55.180
David Schaich (he): and then the expected final position

636
00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.490
David Schaich (he): be expressed.

637
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.400
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

638
00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:06.280
David Schaich (he): A way. That depends on the time.

639
00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:07.590
David Schaich (he): the

640
00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:23.800
David Schaich (he): which we can define as a so-called drift philosophy. You know.

641
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:26.240
David Schaich (he): times the time that passes.

642
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:31.460
David Schaich (he): So in words, this

643
00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.590
David Schaich (he): expected final position

644
00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:41.240
David Schaich (he): use drifting

645
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:45.240
David Schaich (he): and it drifts with it.

646
00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:50.080
David Schaich (he): The velocity

647
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:51.960
David Schaich (he): it is just

648
00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:55.850
David Schaich (he): yeah expected length of the walk.

649
00:54:55.940 --> 00:55:00.620
David Schaich (he): You find it by time. It is for any velocity

650
00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:05.600
David Schaich (he): we can do something similar for

651
00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:07.350
David Schaich (he): fluctuations.

652
00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:27.000
David Schaich (he): We have from here that those fluctuations are 4 times Mp. Queue.

653
00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:41.840
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Number of steps is now again the total time divided by the time interval for each step

654
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:44.490
David Schaich (he): P. And Q.

655
00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:47.830
David Schaich (he): Yes.

656
00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:52.070
David Schaich (he): again, something that

657
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:56.780
David Schaich (he): grows linearly with the tile

658
00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:00.840
David Schaich (he): just there. So you probably

659
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:05.220
David Schaich (he): it grows linearly with the number of steps that we solve for

660
00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:06.860
David Schaich (he): our simple example

661
00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:11.500
David Schaich (he): so

662
00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:24.270
David Schaich (he): defining these fluctuations. the the square of some Delta X.

663
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.400
David Schaich (he): Let me see

664
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:28.680
David Schaich (he): diffusion, length.

665
00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:35.730
David Schaich (he): or alternately, the uncertainty in that final position. X.

666
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:39.610
David Schaich (he): This result is

667
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:45.380
David Schaich (he): a particular example of so called wall of the fusion.

668
00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:49.950
David Schaich (he): the state that

669
00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:52.950
David Schaich (he): this diffusion, length, Delta X

670
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:55.550
David Schaich (he): is proportional

671
00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:59.570
David Schaich (he): to the square root of the time that passes is

672
00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:02.240
David Schaich (he): the particles in question are allowed to

673
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:06.960
David Schaich (he): walk and allowed to diffuse through that process of around the walk.

674
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:17.900
David Schaich (he): In a particular. the concept of proportionality and call the I will see

675
00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:22.020
David Schaich (he): confusion constant.

676
00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:24.830
David Schaich (he): which

677
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:27.450
David Schaich (he): the the

678
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:30.990
David Schaich (he): scale of fluctuations

679
00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:35.810
David Schaich (he): we have

680
00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:40.270
David Schaich (he): in the particular process we are considering, so

681
00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:45.380
David Schaich (he): looks a bit better. And focus now

682
00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:51.930
David Schaich (he): with you

683
00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.590
David Schaich (he): simple one-dimensional

684
00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:03.030
David Schaich (he): that we use to get at these very general results.

685
00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.950
David Schaich (he): We have the velocity

686
00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:09.160
David Schaich (he): that is

687
00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:12.880
David Schaich (he): Gp minus one

688
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:21.770
David Schaich (he): over that time interval which, without loss of generality, we can set the time interval to be one working units of

689
00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:30.370
David Schaich (he): all steps. I'll leave it there for now. yeah, put in that the diffusion. Constance.

690
00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:31.700
He's

691
00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:35.070
David Schaich (he): that's square root of 4 Pq.

692
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:37.610
David Schaich (he): Over the time interval

693
00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:47.130
David Schaich (he): we can get back to the limiting cases that we check just before the break, when either of P. Or Q. Are 0,

694
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:52.240
David Schaich (he): when all of the steps are in one or the other direction, with a 100% probability.

695
00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:56.820
David Schaich (he): Then we saw that the fluctuations

696
00:58:56.850 --> 00:59:02.750
David Schaich (he): and to vanish and correspondingly D. Vanishes as well, and it is maximized.

697
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:07.140
David Schaich (he): when P. Is equal to Q. With a 100%

698
00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.450
David Schaich (he): yeah process of

699
00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.760
David Schaich (he): spreading out or the fusion.

700
00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:22.000
David Schaich (he): We had. Look at these

701
00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:28.000
David Schaich (he): examples in a bit more

702
00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:29.490
David Schaich (he): visual detail.

703
00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:34.400
David Schaich (he): So if we start off good.

704
00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:38.990
David Schaich (he): But I just mentioned the case of maximum diffusion.

705
00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:42.570
David Schaich (he): I need to zoom out

706
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.600
David Schaich (he): to get this on the graph. I'm sorry to get this on the projector.

707
00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:54.380
David Schaich (he): So what we have here

708
00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:56.520
it is that case

709
00:59:57.570 --> 00:59:58.830
David Schaich (he): A. P.

710
00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:11.570
David Schaich (he): And Q. Equal to each other. equal t0 100. The drift velocity was proportional t0 2 P. Minus one. So there is

711
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:17.010
David Schaich (he): no drift in this random walk. but the

712
01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:21.910
David Schaich (he): diffusion constant is 2 times

713
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:26.250
David Schaich (he): the square root of the half squared. s0 2 times a half is one.

714
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:30.220
David Schaich (he): All that is left is that one over Route

715
01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:36.150
David Schaich (he): delta T. The time interval which we can take to be one without loss of generality.

716
01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:42.450
David Schaich (he): The curves on this plot are for a probability distribution.

717
01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.880
David Schaich (he): The one coming from the central limit theorem for

718
01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:50.150
David Schaich (he): this random walk with P. Equals. Q equals a half.

719
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:55.240
David Schaich (he): and as time goes on you can see that the

720
01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.280
David Schaich (he): expected position for each of these walks

721
01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:04.560
David Schaich (he): always remains right at the start of a position X equals 0.

722
01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:08.130
David Schaich (he): I'll note that the

723
01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:16.560
David Schaich (he): maximum of the scaption probability distribution is it X equals 0, the ex, the expectation value or expected value.

724
01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.220
David Schaich (he): It's different from that maximum, but turns out

725
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:22.190
David Schaich (he): for the caption distribution to the

726
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:26.800
David Schaich (he): obviously related to it. Thanks to the reflection, symmetry

727
01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:29.510
David Schaich (he): around the central point in the caption.

728
01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:32.910
David Schaich (he): So we have that so

729
01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:42.370
David Schaich (he): fixed expectation value on X equals 0, that we found

730
01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.630
David Schaich (he): just from our analytic expressions for

731
01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:46.880
this

732
01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:52.710
David Schaich (he): this quality of the file position. But we also see that as time passes

733
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:56.430
David Schaich (he): where time is going from one t0 10,

734
01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:58.540
David Schaich (he): the probability, distribution.

735
01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:04.780
David Schaich (he): or the scale of fluctuations around that expected central value of 0

736
01:02:04.890 --> 01:02:06.380
David Schaich (he): is gradually

737
01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:10.270
David Schaich (he): spreading out and getting wider and wire

738
01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.510
David Schaich (he): to going from

739
01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:15.970
David Schaich (he): time of one up to larger times.

740
01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.710
David Schaich (he): So the you know

741
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.240
David Schaich (he): interval

742
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:27.050
David Schaich (he): that contains a fixed amount of probability is

743
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:30.590
David Schaich (he): steadily growing. You may have

744
01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.480
David Schaich (he): heard of. They're called one signal

745
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.010
David Schaich (he): intervals, and probability distributions of this sort

746
01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:49.150
David Schaich (he): that corresponds to the range of which the distribution needs to be integrated, so that the overall probability

747
01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:52.510
David Schaich (he): and it's up to roughly 68%.

748
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:56.170
David Schaich (he): That is. that interval

749
01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:04.990
David Schaich (he): it's steadily growing as time goes on with this growth just related to

750
01:03:07.570 --> 01:03:12.310
David Schaich (he): the diffusion constant for this random walk, which is

751
01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.950
David Schaich (he): maximized at.

752
01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.410
David Schaich (he): So that is

753
01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:29.040
David Schaich (he): the way the probabilities for competing this walk many times of all.

754
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:32.680
David Schaich (he): As time passes they gradually spread out.

755
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:33.680
David Schaich (he): Hey!

756
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:39.190
David Schaich (he): I can now consider the opposite limits, where

757
01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:40.620
David Schaich (he): there is

758
01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:45.740
David Schaich (he): a much larger probability of stepping in one direction to the white

759
01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:50.190
David Schaich (he): rather than the other direction. To the left the drift velocity

760
01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.360
David Schaich (he): in this case

761
01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:56.100
David Schaich (he): 2 P. Minus one is

762
01:03:57.890 --> 01:04:01.130
David Schaich (he): 4.9 8, close to the maximum value

763
01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:02.960
David Schaich (he): that it can have.

764
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:06.040
David Schaich (he): Well, you

765
01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:20.170
David Schaich (he): refusing to cost them correspondingly. He is close to the lowest value that it can have. So it is 2 times the square root

766
01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:22.070
David Schaich (he): of P.

767
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:34.580
David Schaich (he): Times. Q. So that's approximately one approximately one over 100, so they should be approximately to the square root of 100 is 2 tenths. Actual value is not quite that

768
01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:39.940
David Schaich (he): 1.1 9 9. What we are seeing is.

769
01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:49.160
David Schaich (he): it's on the ocean. Probability distribution now on a slightly different set of axes is no longer fixed with the starting point. It is

770
01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.110
David Schaich (he): really

771
01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:56.780
David Schaich (he): essentially a 100% probability, always larger than 0, always positive.

772
01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:58.080
David Schaich (he): The

773
01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:05.690
David Schaich (he): expectation value for this option remains the point where the distribution is maximized

774
01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:09.950
David Schaich (he): that is quickly riffing off to the

775
01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:17.650
David Schaich (he): right with that velocity as and passes. And although we do have

776
01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:22.540
David Schaich (he): the diffusion, the spreading out of this probability distribution

777
01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:26.270
David Schaich (he): with time. the rate at which

778
01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:28.900
David Schaich (he): the one Sigma interval.

779
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.990
David Schaich (he): or

780
01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:36.430
David Schaich (he): any other interval that integrates to a fixed amount of probability. It grows.

781
01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:39.210
David Schaich (he): It's smaller than we saw before.

782
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:43.450
David Schaich (he): due to the smaller fusion. Coefficients or diffusion costs

783
01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:46.250
David Schaich (he): point 2 rather than one.

784
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:50.270
David Schaich (he): and then we can

785
01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:53.970
David Schaich (he): look at the intermediate case between those 2 extremes

786
01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:58.150
David Schaich (he): where P. And Q. Are not exactly equal.

787
01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.350
David Schaich (he): 2 times point 6 minus one

788
01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:07.340
David Schaich (he): is 4, point 2.

789
01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:12.240
David Schaich (he): The diffusion constants is 2

790
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:21.750
David Schaich (he): of the point, 2 4, so that's the point you forward is roughly points 5

791
01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.630
David Schaich (he): where a quarter is a half

792
01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.410
David Schaich (he): that is

793
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:35.270
David Schaich (he): close t0 0ne comes out just below 1.9 8, so very close the maximum value for the fusion coefficient that we had

794
01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:46.900
David Schaich (he): with P. Aq. Or equal. And now there is a slope drift to the right. At the same time. Yes, there is more pronounced.

795
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:49.150
David Schaich (he): the fusion or spreading out.

796
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:50.140
David Schaich (he): and

797
01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:54.100
David Schaich (he): the probability distributions.

798
01:06:55.230 --> 01:07:02.010
David Schaich (he): so it's slow drift with a relatively quick diffusion. and the more it will turn out to be

799
01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:06.530
David Schaich (he): a more typical physical behavior. Is this

800
01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.750
David Schaich (he): kind of diffusive behavior rather than

801
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:11.020
yeah.

802
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:15.630
David Schaich (he): very quick drift, without so much diffusion.

803
01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:19.360
David Schaich (he): So getting back to

804
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.030
David Schaich (he): the

805
01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:28.030
David Schaich (he): calculations that we had been doing so

806
01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.130
David Schaich (he): through those examples of

807
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:40.870
David Schaich (he): vanishing large and small velocities, and the corresponding. if you

808
01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:47.150
David Schaich (he): different values of those.

809
01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:56.960
David Schaich (he): What we'll do now

810
01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.640
David Schaich (he): too much focus

811
01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:06.310
David Schaich (he): we can connect.

812
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.630
David Schaich (he): It's usually

813
01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:13.410
David Schaich (he): to the central.

814
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:18.729
David Schaich (he): which we can recall.

815
01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:31.779
David Schaich (he): He goes analytic expression for the probability distribution of the sum of many variables. In this case you can consider each random step in the war.

816
01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:37.800
David Schaich (he): be one of those variables. The sum is that final position. X that we're interested in.

817
01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:41.200
David Schaich (he): and the central limit 0

818
01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:44.460
that we could emphasize

819
01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.010
David Schaich (he): repeatedly, is believing the

820
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:51.120
David Schaich (he): overall behavior of that final position. X.

821
01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:58.420
David Schaich (he): Just 2 properties of the individual step. In particular. It's mean view.

822
01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:01.010
David Schaich (he): invariance. Sigma squared.

823
01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:07.319
David Schaich (he): so that X is the same as the some you define when introducing

824
01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:11.560
David Schaich (he): the central limit theorem in the 4 0f that

825
01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:15.950
David Schaich (he): we care about, and this should be a good approximation

826
01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.689
David Schaich (he): approaching inequality.

827
01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:20.370
David Schaich (he): When the number of steps

828
01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:23.330
David Schaich (he): that we have to

829
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:28.279
David Schaich (he): account for.

830
01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:31.479
David Schaich (he): So what we want to do is to analyze

831
01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:35.109
David Schaich (he): this probability distribution, or the file position.

832
01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:39.569
David Schaich (he): Is that me and you.

833
01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:44.430
David Schaich (he): Sigma Square.

834
01:09:47.649 --> 01:09:48.779
David Schaich (he): how is that

835
01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:54.170
David Schaich (he): single step process, the single variable

836
01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:57.220
David Schaich (he): in the context of the

837
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:02.560
David Schaich (he): So given the

838
01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:11.210
David Schaich (he): simple random walk, we have set up one dimension, probability. P. Is something we write and queue a step into the left.

839
01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:19.110
David Schaich (he): Anyone read off the the mean every single step.

840
01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:28.730
David Schaich (he): This to be

841
01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:35.780
David Schaich (he): expectation value of one of these steps. X Sub. I. That get some double

842
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:37.680
David Schaich (he): for the walk as a whole.

843
01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.180
David Schaich (he): recall the

844
01:11:00.190 --> 01:11:02.350
David Schaich (he): definition of

845
01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:06.780
David Schaich (he): expectation, value something over all possible outcomes

846
01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:10.020
David Schaich (he): in our outcome space, the value of that outcome

847
01:11:10.690 --> 01:11:23.460
David Schaich (he): corresponding probability. So this is maybe a bit subtle to come up with independently that the 2 0utcomes we have one is stepping to the right

848
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:24.440
she is.

849
01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:26.440
David Schaich (he): Is that the platform?

850
01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:37.630
David Schaich (he): I'm. Set t0 0ne without loss of generality. The probability of stepping to the right is P. And the other outcome, you have

851
01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:43.910
David Schaich (he): step me to the left with that same fixed step. 5. I have this with probability 2

852
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:44.970
David Schaich (he): which is

853
01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:49.980
David Schaich (he): one minus P. So that the probabilities add up t0 0ne

854
01:11:50.210 --> 01:11:54.360
David Schaich (he): so plus p minus one minus P.

855
01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:56.060
Gives us

856
01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:59.710
David Schaich (he): 2 P. Minus one for

857
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:04.860
David Schaich (he): the main mute

858
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:07.850
David Schaich (he): of the probability distribution double David.

859
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:09.850
David Schaich (he): our simple random walk example.

860
01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.820
David Schaich (he): and we can recognize

861
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:19.450
David Schaich (he): that for

862
01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:20.490
no.

863
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:30.690
David Schaich (he): in the drift of what today. for the overall and a walk.

864
01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.580
David Schaich (he): and in fact.

865
01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:42.590
David Schaich (he): S0 2 P. Minus one is the encrypt velocity multiplied by that time interval, delta t

866
01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:47.040
David Schaich (he): delta t itself is

867
01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:55.410
David Schaich (he): yeah whole time divided by the number of steps. So

868
01:12:56.950 --> 01:13:00.840
David Schaich (he): this mean from the single step underlying

869
01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:02.260
David Schaich (he): are we able to walk?

870
01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:05.010
Is yeah.

871
01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:06.810
David Schaich (he): gift velocity.

872
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:10.610
David Schaich (he): Times

873
01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:17.270
David Schaich (he): to you are in which is rearranged

874
01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:20.430
David Schaich (he): like. So

875
01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:29.520
David Schaich (he): there's a similar calculation to do

876
01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:37.320
David Schaich (he): with the expected value of the square of each individual step where

877
01:13:39.650 --> 01:13:44.240
David Schaich (he): it's the same definition of expectation that we always have

878
01:13:44.610 --> 01:13:45.480
just have a.

879
01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:48.660
David Schaich (he): Now X. I squared with my

880
01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.740
David Schaich (he): each probability. and because

881
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:55.510
David Schaich (he): minus one squared and plus one squared are both one.

882
01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:00.470
David Schaich (he): We get p plus Q. Which are defined to add up t0 0ne.

883
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:06.080
David Schaich (he): and we can immediately write down the variance of our single step.

884
01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:12.220
David Schaich (he): It is that expectation value of the step squared.

885
01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:15.140
David Schaich (he): one minus mu squared

886
01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.530
David Schaich (he): Mu is 2 P. Minus one.

887
01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:29.450
David Schaich (he): so we have one minus 4 P. Square. minus 2 p plus one

888
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:35.070
David Schaich (he): holding out an overall factor of that is a 4, a 2

889
01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:42.340
David Schaich (he): or P squared minus 4 P. Plus one. The ones cancel. We have the overall factor of 4 P.

890
01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:43.630
David Schaich (he): And

891
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:47.110
David Schaich (he): with that negative sign out front.

892
01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:50.890
David Schaich (he): What is left over is one minus

893
01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:57.830
David Schaich (he): p, which is n0 2 surprisingly 4 P. Queue. the

894
01:14:57.900 --> 01:14:59.980
David Schaich (he): same factor

895
01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:01.660
David Schaich (he): that showed up in

896
01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:04.770
David Schaich (he): the fluctuations of that total step length.

897
01:15:08.150 --> 01:15:12.440
David Schaich (he): We're probably in the square of that diffusion constant

898
01:15:12.970 --> 01:15:13.910
I can

899
01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:23.110
David Schaich (he): you just right there at the square. The Diffusion Council is 4 Pq. Over delta t.

900
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:28.350
David Schaich (he): That delta t now is.

901
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:33.150
David Schaich (he): and the denominator is still t over m. We have.

902
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.050
David Schaich (he): or, in other words.

903
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:43.280
David Schaich (he): Sigma squared is

904
01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:50.610
David Schaich (he): the diffusion. Constants d squared time to divided by

905
01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.500
David Schaich (he): and

906
01:15:58.230 --> 01:16:01.920
David Schaich (he): going to well. a new page and see what I can

907
01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.470
David Schaich (he): on the projector. But just to

908
01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:07.470
David Schaich (he): emphasize

909
01:16:09.450 --> 01:16:10.890
David Schaich (he): one last thing.

910
01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:17.460
David Schaich (he): so the results that we have found

911
01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:22.850
David Schaich (he): the leading, the

912
01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:28.880
David Schaich (he): mean of a single step in a random walk

913
01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:30.700
David Schaich (he): to

914
01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.620
David Schaich (he): the proof velocity Times time.

915
01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.670
David Schaich (he): as well as relating the

916
01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:38.950
David Schaich (he): period of Sigma squared

917
01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:47.400
David Schaich (he): to the huge and constant squared. I've signed those relations

918
01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:56.510
David Schaich (he): turned out to be general results for all well-behaved probability distributions with a

919
01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:59.640
David Schaich (he): finite main and various

920
01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:03.960
David Schaich (he): finite diffusion, coefficients and riff velocity

921
01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:10.600
David Schaich (he): the particular factors of P. And Q.

922
01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:15.280
David Schaich (he): That we came up with to establish. These relations, for this example.

923
01:17:18.490 --> 01:17:20.640
David Schaich (he): are specific to

924
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:28.840
David Schaich (he): the simple one-dimensional fixed up, like

925
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:31.150
David Schaich (he): you know what

926
01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:35.680
David Schaich (he): that we are considering. Those are not

927
01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:39.780
David Schaich (he): generic or not, general.

928
01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:49.940
David Schaich (he): If you believe that there is this

929
01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:56.180
David Schaich (he): fairly reasonable relation between the need of each step, and how much end steps

930
01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:59.130
David Schaich (he): drift in time, how much they diffuse

931
01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.430
David Schaich (he): you, can

932
01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.470
David Schaich (he): we? We rewrite the expression for

933
01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:14.250
David Schaich (he): the central

934
01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:17.660
David Schaich (he): that we had earlier in terms

935
01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:19.330
David Schaich (he): how

936
01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.660
David Schaich (he): the diffusion constants.

937
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:31.100
David Schaich (he): and the velocity

938
01:18:41.410 --> 01:18:42.840
David Schaich (he): which we can

939
01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:45.780
David Schaich (he): go back to

940
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:55.500
David Schaich (he): these examples and illustrations, and confirm what we were seeing earlier, with the algebraic expressions for trip velocity and diffusion.

941
01:18:55.710 --> 01:18:57.950
David Schaich (he): that each of these curves is

942
01:18:58.270 --> 01:19:02.390
David Schaich (he): a Gaussian probabilities. Distribution of this sort.

943
01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:07.650
David Schaich (he): As time goes on the

944
01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:10.940
David Schaich (he): the gauge, the exponential factor in the Gaussian is maximized

945
01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:12.740
David Schaich (he): when this argument is 0,

946
01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:13.870
because

947
01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:16.980
David Schaich (he): all of the terms in it are

948
01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:20.130
David Schaich (he): positive either to T

949
01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:22.690
David Schaich (he): for square.

950
01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.940
David Schaich (he): So the peak and the Gaussian

951
01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:27.280
David Schaich (he): will be occurring.

952
01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:32.390
David Schaich (he): X is equal to

953
01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:34.970
David Schaich (he): velocity times time

954
01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:36.480
so.

955
01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:47.040
David Schaich (he): and similarly the

956
01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:52.020
David Schaich (he): with that of their caution is going to

957
01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:55.310
David Schaich (he): increase as time goes on.

958
01:19:57.450 --> 01:20:05.680
David Schaich (he): Governed by this factor of 2D squared T. The diffusion constant squared, and the denominator.

959
01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:10.850
David Schaich (he): so that to some factor is reducing the

960
01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:16.300
David Schaich (he): size of the argument the exponential for a fixed numerator, if it's a distance

961
01:20:16.370 --> 01:20:20.790
David Schaich (he): of the peak of the probability distribution. So that's

962
01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:24.660
distance from the P. Has to increase in order to get a

963
01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:27.010
David Schaich (he): fixed value of

964
01:20:27.070 --> 01:20:31.570
David Schaich (he): the exponential factor that fixed with to that caption distribution.

965
01:20:31.930 --> 01:20:34.330
David Schaich (he): and similarly because the

966
01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:42.360
David Schaich (he): now she is spreading out, and it's with this becoming wider in order to it's this

967
01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:46.450
David Schaich (he): no wise as he.

968
01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:52.300
David Schaich (he): We'll be fine probability distribution that integrates t0 100%

969
01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:55.790
David Schaich (he): that normalization factor

970
01:20:56.910 --> 01:20:57.840
David Schaich (he): has to.

971
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:02.000
David Schaich (he): Again.

972
01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:05.690
David Schaich (he): it decreases.

973
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:11.610
David Schaich (he): I mean that with the square root of this combination D squared on this team.

974
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:18.370
David Schaich (he): That is the rate at which the height of the peaks in the distribution are dropping

975
01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.760
David Schaich (he): as they with increase, and

976
01:21:21.070 --> 01:21:22.830
David Schaich (he): the walks that they describe

977
01:21:25.770 --> 01:21:26.950
David Schaich (he): spread out

978
01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:32.380
David Schaich (he): one last thing that we

979
01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:35.050
David Schaich (he): we'll look at before turning to

980
01:21:35.150 --> 01:21:37.900
David Schaich (he): statistical ensemble is

981
01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:42.220
David Schaich (he): actually comparing They' a lot of the fusion

982
01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:46.460
David Schaich (he): what we can expect as time goes on for

983
01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:53.360
David Schaich (he): the drift of a random walk compared to

984
01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.290
David Schaich (he): it's diffusion.

985
01:21:57.170 --> 01:21:58.090
David Schaich (he): So

986
01:22:01.230 --> 01:22:03.400
David Schaich (he): assuming we have

987
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:11.050
David Schaich (he): the non 0 with velocity. Then the expected final position

988
01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:14.030
of our walk is going to

989
01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:21.210
David Schaich (he): very proportional to the time that the walk lasts.

990
01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:26.630
David Schaich (he): whereas

991
01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:30.420
David Schaich (he): the

992
01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:37.520
David Schaich (he): diffusion length, Delta X. We saw a lot of the fusion is proportional to the square root of the T.

993
01:22:38.010 --> 01:22:44.490
David Schaich (he): So, putting these together and looking at the relative fluctuations or the

994
01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:48.150
David Schaich (he): scale of uncertainties around the expected final position.

995
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:51.080
David Schaich (he): You know it's proportional to

996
01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:54.080
David Schaich (he): That's square

997
01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.600
David Schaich (he): divided by team from Drift.

998
01:22:57.170 --> 01:22:59.330
David Schaich (he): a factor of one over root T,

999
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:03.510
David Schaich (he): which is going to vanish

1000
01:23:03.670 --> 01:23:05.380
David Schaich (he): at large times

1001
01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:09.080
David Schaich (he): t going to infinity.

1002
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:16.360
David Schaich (he): So there are to facts to keep in mind that although

1003
01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:23.110
David Schaich (he): the absolute. the fusion of each walk

1004
01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.130
David Schaich (he): he's always growing

1005
01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.290
David Schaich (he): proportional to

1006
01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:36.700
David Schaich (he): that square root t from the wall. Diffusion The you

1007
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:41.970
David Schaich (he): relative uncertainty coming from this diffusion

1008
01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:43.730
David Schaich (he): scale of these

1009
01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.440
David Schaich (he): fluctuations.

1010
01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:53.270
David Schaich (he): the expected position. because

1011
01:23:57.630 --> 01:24:00.860
David Schaich (he): when compared to any knowledge or drift.

1012
01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:14.330
David Schaich (he): And this, again, is that very generic results which we can now

1013
01:24:14.490 --> 01:24:23.150
David Schaich (he): appreciate from having connected diffusion to probability distribution predicted by the central limit. Theorem

1014
01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:25.250
David Schaich (he): express now in terms of

1015
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:30.080
David Schaich (he): the diffusion, coefficients, and grip velocity determined by

1016
01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.770
David Schaich (he): each single step in our random walk.

1017
01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:38.940
David Schaich (he): that really the the law of diffusion itself. It's my it's

1018
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:46.900
David Schaich (he): fancy name as a physical wall is an equivalent statement to

1019
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:48.560
David Schaich (he): the central

1020
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:57.280
David Schaich (he): and in particular, the law of diffusion will hold

1021
01:24:57.370 --> 01:25:02.600
David Schaich (he): whenever the central limit theorem is applicable in the central limit for your own.

1022
01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:03.730
maybe.

1023
01:25:04.210 --> 01:25:05.490
David Schaich (he): can recall

1024
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:06.950
David Schaich (he): only required

1025
01:25:08.370 --> 01:25:09.900
David Schaich (he): Assuming that

1026
01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:12.680
David Schaich (he): I mean

1027
01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:16.580
David Schaich (he): in variance of our single step process.

1028
01:25:17.230 --> 01:25:18.540
David Schaich (he): our finite.

1029
01:25:26.650 --> 01:25:27.990
David Schaich (he): So that is a

1030
01:25:32.050 --> 01:25:34.620
David Schaich (he): nice message to take away from

1031
01:25:34.650 --> 01:25:35.890
David Schaich (he): all of the

1032
01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:41.840
David Schaich (he): probability found that we've been going through starting from definitions of

1033
01:25:42.190 --> 01:25:45.150
David Schaich (he): probability, of the spaces building up to

1034
01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:51.460
David Schaich (he): of all large numbers, central to the If you're in dial, want to fusion. they are all closely connected.

1035
01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:58.160
David Schaich (he): and all behave as they should based on the

1036
01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:01.580
David Schaich (he): You know, the reasonable physical assumption that

1037
01:26:02.150 --> 01:26:10.760
David Schaich (he): the mean and the variance characterizing the probability space are finite. We will see an example of the computer project where

1038
01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:16.300
David Schaich (he): this assumption breaks down. and then. consequently so that some of all diffusion.

1039
01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.670
David Schaich (he): save that for tomorrow, though, and

1040
01:26:19.690 --> 01:26:27.520
David Schaich (he): for the last about 15 min. moving on to the next major topic of statistical ensembles.

1041
01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:33.470
David Schaich (he): dynamic equilibrium and entropy. Before moving on, just one call for

1042
01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:39.860
David Schaich (he): any questions. infusions, or all of curiosity about

1043
01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:43.010
David Schaich (he): these central probability topics.

1044
01:27:03.570 --> 01:27:06.440
David Schaich (he): I'm not saying you, which is reasonable. Given that.

1045
01:27:06.450 --> 01:27:11.620
David Schaich (he): like a lot of these topics we've been looking at so far.

1046
01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:17.050
David Schaich (he): Actually one in the particular form for us to use for the remainder module are

1047
01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:22.530
David Schaich (he): reasonably familiar in things that you've probably seen before, possibly many times.

1048
01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:24.090
David Schaich (he): We're now going to

1049
01:27:25.570 --> 01:27:28.090
David Schaich (he): look at more specialized

1050
01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:31.110
David Schaich (he): statistical physics subjects

1051
01:27:31.190 --> 01:27:35.540
David Schaich (he): that's start to the column less familiar.

1052
01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.110
David Schaich (he): beginning with

1053
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:48.080
David Schaich (he): beginning with the concept of

1054
01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:51.460
David Schaich (he): a statistical on.

1055
01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:53.920
David Schaich (he): So we

1056
01:27:55.540 --> 01:28:02.070
David Schaich (he): general idea that you will now have in mind is to

1057
01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:07.890
David Schaich (he): apply the probability foundations that we have looked at to

1058
01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:12.450
David Schaich (he): the State system. Many particles.

1059
01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:18.640
yes.

1060
01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:21.460
David Schaich (he): are revolving in time

1061
01:28:23.050 --> 01:28:24.740
David Schaich (he): subject to

1062
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:27.630
David Schaich (he): some cause, some constraints

1063
01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:30.420
David Schaich (he): which will be

1064
01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.360
David Schaich (he): specify it shortly

1065
01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:38.960
David Schaich (he): personal. This observation is

1066
01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.910
David Schaich (he): going to connect to

1067
01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:50.930
David Schaich (he): our experiment in the language of probability, that we looked at last week. and

1068
01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:56.540
David Schaich (he): each time we repeat this experiment, and observing these many particles at different points of time.

1069
01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:57.670
David Schaich (he): You will get

1070
01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:58.700
okay

1071
01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:01.760
David Schaich (he): states of that system.

1072
01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:08.630
David Schaich (he): Make up all of you. I'll make a J.

1073
01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:11.750
David Schaich (he): At each time.

1074
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:15.170
David Schaich (he): Let me choose to look at it

1075
01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:20.890
David Schaich (he): and T. J.

1076
01:29:25.810 --> 01:29:28.630
David Schaich (he): And to make this general idea

1077
01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.240
David Schaich (he): a bit more concrete.

1078
01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:31.310
and

1079
01:29:31.610 --> 01:29:35.820
David Schaich (he): provide some simple examples to work through. As we encounter these concepts

1080
01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:39.030
David Schaich (he): introduce.

1081
01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.410
hey?

1082
01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:43.010
David Schaich (he): Another simple but

1083
01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:49.460
David Schaich (he): powerful, highly- thinkable and still widely used Example.

1084
01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:57.520
David Schaich (he): what is known as expense system where our particles.

1085
01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:01.600
David Schaich (he): and more generally our degrees of freedom

1086
01:30:02.010 --> 01:30:03.730
David Schaich (he): are just spins

1087
01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:06.820
David Schaich (he): that point up

1088
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:13.540
David Schaich (he): like. So

1089
01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:18.120
David Schaich (he): we're down.

1090
01:30:18.130 --> 01:30:23.280
David Schaich (he): So the mathematics that these governing these systems is going to get us back to

1091
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:29.280
David Schaich (he): simple example for flipping coins there only 2 possibilities for each particle in the system.

1092
01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:33.970
David Schaich (he): But physically this is applicable to

1093
01:30:34.090 --> 01:30:42.260
David Schaich (he): many different contexts. The original one, from roughly a 100 years ago. was the consideration of

1094
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:45.320
David Schaich (he): magnetic molecules

1095
01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:50.300
David Schaich (he): where

1096
01:30:51.650 --> 01:30:52.660
yeah

1097
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:55.720
David Schaich (he): molecules have some magnetic dipole.

1098
01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:05.380
David Schaich (he): and they want to use probability to predict the behavior of large numbers of these

1099
01:31:06.510 --> 01:31:09.400
David Schaich (he): molecules. In some system

1100
01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:11.940
David Schaich (he): you will

1101
01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:17.180
David Schaich (he): look at these examples throughout the module, including

1102
01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:22.750
David Schaich (he): I'm. Using these as a way to introduce interactions with the easy model later in term.

1103
01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:27.330
David Schaich (he): So that is something to look forward to. That's just you.

1104
01:31:28.710 --> 01:31:29.330
Okay.

1105
01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:33.240
David Schaich (he): How pretty example we have

1106
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:39.100
David Schaich (he): some number of

1107
01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:40.340
we have

1108
01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.340
David Schaich (he): n equals 8

1109
01:31:43.390 --> 01:31:45.980
David Schaich (he): spins is fixed in

1110
01:31:46.130 --> 01:31:47.340
David Schaich (he): one dimension.

1111
01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:56.720
David Schaich (he): Hey, you representative configuration of those inequality spins

1112
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:58.800
look like

1113
01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.130
David Schaich (he): this

1114
01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:04.290
David Schaich (he): collection of 8

1115
01:32:04.570 --> 01:32:08.870
David Schaich (he): particles, 8 degrees of freedom, pointing either up for down.

1116
01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:15.710
David Schaich (he): And do you? Well number all such configurations, is actually

1117
01:32:16.090 --> 01:32:26.320
David Schaich (he): the same as the total number of random walks we considered earlier today. So ask me about that again. We have 2 possibilities

1118
01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:35.890
David Schaich (he): for each of the end spins in the system in this case to the 8 is 200 56.

1119
01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:42.120
David Schaich (he): And now, proceeding through

1120
01:32:43.290 --> 01:32:44.170
David Schaich (he): the

1121
01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:47.820
David Schaich (he): additional probability concepts that we have

1122
01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:49.800
David Schaich (he): introduced.

1123
01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.200
David Schaich (he): we can think about

1124
01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:55.990
David Schaich (he): some of the measurements

1125
01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:05.510
David Schaich (he): that we could do to the States or the configurations of the spin system.

1126
01:33:08.330 --> 01:33:10.480
David Schaich (he): and if we were to

1127
01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.030
David Schaich (he): measure.

1128
01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:16.390
David Schaich (he): see the number of spins

1129
01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:22.690
David Schaich (he): for all of those 256

1130
01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:29.720
David Schaich (he): configurations. you would always get the same result.

1131
01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:34.700
David Schaich (he): There are always

1132
01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:41.050
David Schaich (he): it spins there, which

1133
01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:49.860
David Schaich (he): is obvious, but is also a example of you, so called conserved quantity.

1134
01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:58.450
David Schaich (he): something that is always the same.

1135
01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:04.990
David Schaich (he): Some measurements actually specify that always comes out the same for all of the States

1136
01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:06.620
David Schaich (he): in the system.

1137
01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:22.760
David Schaich (he): So maybe another example that is less trivial than the number of spins that we

1138
01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:24.330
David Schaich (he): fixed by.

1139
01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:28.980
David Schaich (he): I. Fiat is

1140
01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:33.830
David Schaich (he): whole energy.

1141
01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:40.420
David Schaich (he): What I should call you all internal energy

1142
01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:46.350
David Schaich (he): of isolated system

1143
01:34:50.770 --> 01:34:52.450
David Schaich (he): sometimes also call

1144
01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:55.610
David Schaich (he): a closed system, or in the sense that

1145
01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.890
David Schaich (he): it is not able to

1146
01:34:59.410 --> 01:35:05.580
David Schaich (he): exchange any energy with its surroundings and internal energy, in the sense that

1147
01:35:05.630 --> 01:35:09.110
David Schaich (he): the energy we're interested in is intrinsic to

1148
01:35:09.190 --> 01:35:12.170
David Schaich (he): the particles of the we use the freedom in this system.

1149
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:20.310
David Schaich (he): and as account, for example, it doesn't depend on, say, the speed with which an observer is seeing the system itself go by

1150
01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:21.400
David Schaich (he): on the train.

1151
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:34.670
David Schaich (he): Internal energy in that context it's the energy of the system in its overall rest. Space Observer. In the same inertial frame has that system. So

1152
01:35:34.710 --> 01:35:45.780
David Schaich (he): we know that energy is conserved. The energy of some states like I. It's the same as the other States.

1153
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:52.060
David Schaich (he): Well overseas I. J.

1154
01:35:54.130 --> 01:36:02.160
David Schaich (he): And because this was first observing empirically many hundreds of years ago. back, before

1155
01:36:04.030 --> 01:36:09.260
David Schaich (he): statistical physics existed, he was put on a cell mathematical foundation.

1156
01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:17.560
So

1157
01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:22.920
David Schaich (he): this is first

1158
01:36:24.730 --> 01:36:26.680
David Schaich (he): observed it purely that

1159
01:36:28.510 --> 01:36:33.820
David Schaich (he): energy is conserved. and it was dug back in those days.

1160
01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:34.710
The

1161
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:37.400
David Schaich (he): first of all.

1162
01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:40.250
David Schaich (he): i'll throw it at the Mx.

1163
01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:49.070
David Schaich (he): Which is something of a grand Us name for.

1164
01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:50.280
Hey, you

1165
01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:57.380
David Schaich (he): phenomenon that is now familiar to us, and mathematically can also be proven

1166
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:01.920
David Schaich (he): rigorous land

1167
01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:09.040
David Schaich (he): through the first 0 0f any neuter.

1168
01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:15.050
David Schaich (he): All right; for now, since that was

1169
01:37:15.070 --> 01:37:19.200
David Schaich (he): approved over a 100 years ago, in the early 19 hundreds.

1170
01:37:20.190 --> 01:37:31.760
David Schaich (he): It holds, at least in flat space time. where conservation of energy is related to the invariance of systems as time.

1171
01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:40.510
David Schaich (he): and you also they to be able to.

1172
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:47.400
David Schaich (he): You Never wise this to an equivalent statement.

1173
01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:52.450
David Schaich (he): That's if we relax

1174
01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:54.560
David Schaich (he): our

1175
01:37:55.070 --> 01:38:00.120
David Schaich (he): statements or assumption that our system of interest is closed or isolated.

1176
01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:01.390
David Schaich (he): That's

1177
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:06.930
David Schaich (he): we allow it to change its internal energy.

1178
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:13.890
David Schaich (he): maybe changing the internal energy of

1179
01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:23.740
David Schaich (he): i'm getting a system omega the same character. I think we've let our use for the overall outcome space.

1180
01:38:24.650 --> 01:38:26.680
David Schaich (he): Such a change must in fly.

1181
01:38:28.590 --> 01:38:30.590
David Schaich (he): and the opposite change.

1182
01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:31.740
Oh.

1183
01:38:32.450 --> 01:38:33.830
David Schaich (he): to the energy!

1184
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:40.000
David Schaich (he): I'll see you surroundings

1185
01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:42.600
David Schaich (he): of this system.

1186
01:38:46.890 --> 01:38:53.240
David Schaich (he): so energy is still conserved, but eventually allowed to be exchanged in between

1187
01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:58.680
David Schaich (he): our system and its surroundings. That will be another

1188
01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:05.130
David Schaich (he): avatar of that first law of thermodynamics, the conservation of energy.

1189
01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.660
David Schaich (he): and given the to that is where

1190
01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:10.500
David Schaich (he): we will wrap up today. It will be

1191
01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.820
David Schaich (he): interesting things to say about

1192
01:39:12.910 --> 01:39:16.500
David Schaich (he): energy. It's conservation, and the

1193
01:39:16.690 --> 01:39:19.410
David Schaich (he): statistical ensemble that

1194
01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:20.430
we

1195
01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:23.630
David Schaich (he): obtain when it poses the constraints

1196
01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:28.890
David Schaich (he): that the energy is conserved and not allowed to be exchanged with the surroundings

1197
01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:32.340
David Schaich (he): that will no wait. That will wait till next week.

1198
01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:35.770
David Schaich (he): Once we have that computer liable tomorrow. So I don't, too.

1199
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:39.780
David Schaich (he): See you then, and just ask for any final questions before

1200
01:39:40.270 --> 01:39:44.520
David Schaich (he): closing down the recording. winding up for this morning.

1201
01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:52.180
David Schaich (he): not seeing any. Take care, I hope you have a

1202
01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:56.660
David Schaich (he): good rest of the day. See you tomorrow.

1203
01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:05.320
David Schaich (he): You are welcome.
