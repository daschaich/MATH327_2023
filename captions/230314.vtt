1
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.840
David Schaich (he): Okay, I think we can get underway with

2
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.620
David Schaich (he): the

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.700
David Schaich (he): end of lectures for this week on Tuesday afternoon,

4
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.219
David Schaich (he): the

5
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.070
David Schaich (he): fourteenth of March.  And before I can zoom a lot of this,

6
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.870
David Schaich (he): I will mention the magic number for today:

7
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.060
1, 1,

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.560
David Schaich (he): 0,

9
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.680
David Schaich (he): 9, 0, 5.  And then just

10
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:48.130
David Schaich (he): check in on where we are in the module. We have just wrapped up a couple of weeks of applications of the canonical ensemble.  First to

11
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.480
David Schaich (he): the physics of information in spin systems, then to deal gases, which we

12
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.950
David Schaich (he): put to work in thermodynamic cycles, heat engines and refrigerators,

13
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.640
David Schaich (he): looking in some detail at the Carnot cycle, with a few more to come in tutorial and homework. And now we are

14
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.420
David Schaich (he): changing pack just a bit to go back from applications to

15
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:17.010
David Schaich (he): foundations in a particular develop the mathematical basis of the third

16
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.680
David Schaich (he): major statistical ensemble that we will be looking at in this module.

17
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.490
David Schaich (he): the grand canonical ensemble. They are now

18
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.310
David Schaich (he): neither energy nor particle number is conserved.

19
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.340
David Schaich (he): or rather these temperature and

20
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.020
David Schaich (he): this new quality that we began talking about yesterday

21
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.760
David Schaich (he): are being the first

22
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.770
David Schaich (he): through exchange of both particles and energy

23
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.670
David Schaich (he): between our system and this

24
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.660
David Schaich (he): environments a large external particle reservoir.

25
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.790
David Schaich (he): So right that now, more formally.

26
00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.580
David Schaich (he): it is just for a moment to see if there are any questions or concerns

27
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.430
you want to.

28
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.750
David Schaich (he): through dynamic cycles or other applications of the canonical ensemble

29
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.580
David Schaich (he): before we get

30
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.730
David Schaich (he): set that a move on to the new topic.

31
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.270
David Schaich (he): I'm not seeing any. Let's just

32
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.520
David Schaich (he): that will

33
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.930
David Schaich (he): occupy our attention

34
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.280
David Schaich (he): the rest of the time before the term break.

35
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.600
David Schaich (he): So. in contrast to the micro canonical.

36
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.190
David Schaich (he): what's characterized.

37
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.900
David Schaich (he): My fixed temperature is here.

38
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.740
David Schaich (he): and they fixed chemical potential.

39
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.010
David Schaich (he): you.

40
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.660
David Schaich (he): both of which are still fixed through exchange of the energy.

41
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.480
David Schaich (he): even particles. Really

42
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.050
David Schaich (he): the large external reservoir that is now

43
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.150
David Schaich (he): you particle reservoir, not really

44
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.530
David Schaich (he): through the reservoir, sometimes cool

45
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.980
David Schaich (he): the particle bath

46
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.910
David Schaich (he): sometimes used to refer to the

47
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:59.290
David Schaich (he): And now of these all of these we are used to fixing the temperature by energy exchange with one. That's a feature of the canonical example. The

48
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.280
David Schaich (he): that comes from being able to exchange particles with this large external reservoir.

49
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.080
David Schaich (he): and we wrapped up

50
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.280
David Schaich (he): yesterday by finding this chemical potential

51
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.390
David Schaich (he): you to be proportional to the response of the entropy

52
00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.850
David Schaich (he): with respect to a change of the particle number and a fixed energy

53
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.010
David Schaich (he): micro

54
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.170
David Schaich (he): in particular and equilibrium.

55
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.830
David Schaich (he): it is

56
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.210
David Schaich (he): the

57
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.650
David Schaich (he): so.

58
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.090
David Schaich (he): This, like the temperature itself in the microscopic ensemble. This definition is not immediately obvious.

59
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.690
David Schaich (he): so we will build up some intuition about it in a particular.

60
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.620
David Schaich (he): The use of what we've done with the temperature in the past.

61
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:14.550
David Schaich (he): So one thing we can do is that, thanks to this overall factor of August to you. in front of the it has the same dimensions as the temperature.

62
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.870
David Schaich (he): because we grew up working in this, where.

63
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:28.970
David Schaich (he): for the chemical, potential and dimensions of energy. you can go to them all right intensive quantities

64
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.420
which

65
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:39.280
David Schaich (he): we' to are those that are the same between any 2 subsystems in full dynamic equilibrium.

66
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.620
David Schaich (he): Or if we take any larger system and look at a small portion of it. The

67
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.680
David Schaich (he): intensive qualities, like the temperature of the chemical central state, same

68
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:56.290
David Schaich (he): encountered as to extensive quantities, like the energy Your part of the number that scale.

69
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.320
David Schaich (he): Maybe the

70
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.400
David Schaich (he): the most interesting aspect of the chemical potential is to find here is the negative sign that we have

71
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.910
David Schaich (he): what this. The consequence of this negative sign is that if we consider it

72
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.490
David Schaich (he): these so-called natural systems, that we

73
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:28.810
David Schaich (he): several weeks ago, in the context of these were systems that have of the temperature in contrast to system. That was on that first homework assignment.

74
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.920
David Schaich (he): Before these natural systems you can expect in general

75
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.910
David Schaich (he): a larger number of particles to

76
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.420
David Schaich (he): to a larger amount of entropy.

77
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:52.740
David Schaich (he): just by having more information about how those larger numbers of particles can be distributed on various different microstates.

78
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:58.990
David Schaich (he): That's the This is true, even if we

79
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.130
David Schaich (he): fix the amount of energy

80
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:09.260
David Schaich (he): that all of the particles can have a total. So in mathematical technology, what this

81
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.060
David Schaich (he): relation means is that

82
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.960
David Schaich (he): you change the entropy.

83
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.520
David Schaich (he): maybe change the particle number.

84
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:25.900
David Schaich (he): If the particle number right changes in positive direction, we add more particles, we get more entropy. We have both the

85
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.310
David Schaich (he): change in response in this greater than 0.

86
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:46.000
David Schaich (he): In a sense. the chemical potential is that partial derivative multiply the positive temperature with the negative sign we end up with the negative chemical potential for natural systems.

87
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.230
David Schaich (he): And really the selling that we put in here is

88
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.200
David Schaich (he): to some extent our scholars

89
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.690
David Schaich (he): I mean choice in the global theoretical physics.

90
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.260
David Schaich (he): and the choice To have

91
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:08.120
David Schaich (he): a natural chemical potential to be negative is made to simplified

92
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.060
any

93
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.630
David Schaich (he): our intuition about how

94
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.650
David Schaich (he): systems behave. Given

95
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.040
David Schaich (he): the chemical potential that they have.

96
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.210
I appreciate this by

97
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.330
David Schaich (he): considering a process of particles from between

98
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.980
David Schaich (he): 2 systems much like the

99
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.980
David Schaich (he): heat Exchange.

100
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:42.299
David Schaich (he): Well experiment that we used to check that the micro canonical definition of the temperature

101
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:47.470
David Schaich (he): behaves as we would expect from everyday experience with temperature. We don't have

102
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.010
David Schaich (he): so much everyday experience that we can.

103
00:08:52.290 --> 00:09:03.790
David Schaich (he): We will see that our temperature and heat well, intuition here he is over next to this negative sign. So we have 2 systems call it in.

104
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.710
David Schaich (he): They all in

105
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:12.000
David Schaich (he): from one critical contact, so they are not divided at all.

106
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.210
David Schaich (he): and they have some

107
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.800
David Schaich (he): number of particles.

108
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.740
David Schaich (he): and i' to

109
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.450
David Schaich (he): exchange those particles as time goes by.

110
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.760
David Schaich (he): You want to see how this process depends

111
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:45.570
David Schaich (he): on the chemical potentials that each of these systems have for simplicity. Let's have both of these systems at the same

112
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.140
David Schaich (he): positive temperature.

113
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.630
David Schaich (he): So if we consider the case without the generality.

114
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.710
David Schaich (he): suppose that we have labeled these systems

115
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.980
David Schaich (he): Substance.

116
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.200
David Schaich (he): U. A. Is a

117
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.100
David Schaich (he): more negative number than

118
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.480
sure.

119
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.570
David Schaich (he): the system B.

120
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.280
David Schaich (he): So what this means.

121
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.180
David Schaich (he): since the temperature is the same is that the

122
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.200
David Schaich (he): partial derivative of the interviewing system. A. With respect to

123
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.380
David Schaich (he): it is a larger content quality. Yeah.

124
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.940
David Schaich (he): a system meeting.

125
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:39.470
David Schaich (he): And you want to consider what implications this has

126
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:49.700
David Schaich (he): no the fact that we're talking about changes in entropy with respect to changes in the number of particles

127
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:55.150
David Schaich (he): they h into, that the second wall is going to come into play.

128
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.360
David Schaich (he): So

129
00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:03.190
David Schaich (he): if we suppose that there is. see that is. on the screen.

130
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.300
David Schaich (he): these little particles between

131
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.860
David Schaich (he): these 2 systems, a and B means that the number of

132
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:18.170
David Schaich (he): system a is going to change by an amount that is equal and opposite to

133
00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.100
David Schaich (he): you. Change your

134
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:30.220
David Schaich (he): and this process will me to so changing the overall entropy

135
00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.140
David Schaich (he): of those 2 systems.

136
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:47.900
David Schaich (he): So the and the some of the will change the energy, and

137
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.690
David Schaich (he): each one separately.

138
00:11:53.240 --> 00:12:00.130
David Schaich (he): you can with fixed energy. Just relate to particle flow

139
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.780
David Schaich (he): in the

140
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.900
David Schaich (he): natural way.

141
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:16.620
David Schaich (he): By the second ball of thermodynamics is overall. Change the entropy of the universe. Anything negative?

142
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.990
David Schaich (he): Yeah, it's greater than 0.

143
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:37.240
David Schaich (he): So the total amount of energy in the universe is a non-decreasing quantity and generically an increasing one and plugging in this relation between the change in the particle number of each subsystem

144
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.510
David Schaich (he): we have the

145
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.690
David Schaich (he): and change the number of particles.

146
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:49.210
David Schaich (he): the subsystem thing with the more negative chemical potential.

147
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.450
David Schaich (he): So where is the smaller chemical potential

148
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.530
David Schaich (he): multiply it by

149
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.040
David Schaich (he): difference

150
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:06.690
David Schaich (he): Changes in the entropy across those 2 subsystems

151
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:21.900
David Schaich (he): is a non-negative number. Since we set things up that the partial derivative system a is the larger one. This turn the brackets is greater than or equal to 0,

152
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:28.600
David Schaich (he): which then applies by the second. the particles must well

153
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.540
David Schaich (he): from System B to system. A oops there is

154
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.060
David Schaich (he): that on the screen for you

155
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.610
David Schaich (he): number of public goals in system a increases

156
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.960
David Schaich (he): the changes greater than 0, precisely because we chose it to have

157
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.760
David Schaich (he): the smaller chemical potential. So in words.

158
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.660
David Schaich (he): with our definition of chemical potential.

159
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:15.810
David Schaich (he): there is a larger chemical potential 2 areas or systems of smaller chemical potential. which is exactly the same behavior as we

160
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:23.490
David Schaich (he): we expect with keep flow related to the temperature. He flows from high temperature regions to coal furniture regions.

161
00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:31.260
David Schaich (he): So we can essentially our same intuition about temperature and energy

162
00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.820
that to

163
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.050
David Schaich (he): the relation between chemical potential and particles.

164
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.080
David Schaich (he): any questions about

165
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:59.340
David Schaich (he): the definition of chemical potential or its role in the grand canonical ensemble.

166
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.110
David Schaich (he): Before you go on to.

167
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.930
David Schaich (he): we develop the mathematical toolkit

168
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.210
David Schaich (he): for analyzing the

169
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.060
David Schaich (he): mathematically.

170
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.050
David Schaich (he): I'll see if I can

171
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.570
David Schaich (he): fix this projector. Okay. So this would be better.

172
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:45.330
David Schaich (he): So we've seen the for the definition of the great economic ensemble just as we had for the not even

173
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:57.330
David Schaich (he): you step in doing anything with either the canonical. The first step is always to compute

174
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.420
David Schaich (he): the partition function for which.

175
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:01.600
and

176
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.390
David Schaich (he): derive

177
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:11.060
David Schaich (he): any other qualities of interest, like the entropy, internal energy. one media.

178
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:18.580
David Schaich (he): the particle number. And as for

179
00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:26.130
David Schaich (he): the case of economic working through.

180
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.310
David Schaich (he): you want to

181
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.380
David Schaich (he): find some expression for

182
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.980
microstate probabilities

183
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.770
David Schaich (he): that are independence. any details

184
00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.180
David Schaich (he): of the particle reservoir.

185
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.300
David Schaich (he): So you may recall that

186
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:59.540
David Schaich (he): with the economical ensemble we derived it gives distribution that dependent on the Boltzmann factor

187
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.070
David Schaich (he): that related the

188
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.040
David Schaich (he): okay microstates to

189
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.060
David Schaich (he): exponential.

190
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:17.290
David Schaich (he): But this is energy over the temperature or divided by that canonical.

191
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.020
David Schaich (he): No, we're pretty bad. So

192
00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:34.740
David Schaich (he): innovation that construction out of microstate probabilities in the grand chemical context for the particle number. He's also allowed to change

193
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.160
David Schaich (he): between various microstates

194
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.170
David Schaich (he): with these probabilities.

195
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.010
David Schaich (he): The same trick that

196
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.700
David Schaich (he): we use in the chemical case

197
00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:50.220
David Schaich (he): right

198
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:55.450
David Schaich (he): well motivated

199
00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.480
David Schaich (he): in the form of the particle reservoir.

200
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.640
David Schaich (he): and then carry out the computation.

201
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:15.330
David Schaich (he): other microstate probabilities. and show that all information about the particle reservoir he is. props away. It becomes unknowable, except for the fact that it fixes

202
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:22.820
David Schaich (he): the temperature and chemical potential. So this is that same sort of administration that we looked at before

203
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.420
David Schaich (he): for the replica in the canonical case. The difference now is that we have

204
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:36.700
David Schaich (he): our system of interest, Omega. We have a large number of copies of that system.

205
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:37.990
David Schaich (he): so

206
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:43.290
David Schaich (he): the total system will make a total.

207
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.750
David Schaich (he): This combination of

208
00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.160
David Schaich (he): times. The reservoir

209
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.500
David Schaich (he): That reservoir is

210
00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:59.280
David Schaich (he): in turn in my R minus one replicas. Okay. So in the end we have

211
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:07.110
David Schaich (he): all right. Total copies of the system. In this case a is 9, and

212
00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:22.600
David Schaich (he): the all of these replicas is governed by the micro canonical ensemble. But the different replicas are about to exchange both heat

213
00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:32.040
David Schaich (he): the orange to a dynamic equilibrium; that, just as in the canonical case. and they're also allowed to exchange particles. you can

214
00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.540
David Schaich (he): out from one

215
00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:39.290
David Schaich (he): the next as Tom was on.

216
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:55.520
David Schaich (he): And so this boxes that we've drawn around the various different replicas are at this point just sort of purely mental constructions.

217
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.030
David Schaich (he): You might think that

218
00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:03.950
David Schaich (he): our system of interest Omega could be a cubic cent of year out of air in this room, and then the reservoir.

219
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.820
David Schaich (he): just the rest of the room, all the other cubic centimeters that we have.

220
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.260
whatever you

221
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.820
David Schaich (he): making, the

222
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.380
David Schaich (he): total energy in both

223
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.770
David Schaich (he): system and

224
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.220
David Schaich (he): that surrounds it is concerned.

225
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:28.800
David Schaich (he): So you will

226
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:40.760
David Schaich (he): some over the energies of all our replicas. And now we have a similar constraint for the particle number.

227
00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:48.670
David Schaich (he): Part of the number in the system is allowed to fluctuate by exchanging particles with the reservoir.

228
00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:55.260
David Schaich (he): Yeah. total all of those replicas I have to have the

229
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:59.780
David Schaich (he): constant served fixed number of particles overall.

230
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:08.060
David Schaich (he): This is also true, I'll add, in the canonical phase, but there it was trivial, because

231
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:12.830
David Schaich (he): every a replica of the system was

232
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.980
David Schaich (he): constrained to have the

233
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:21.930
David Schaich (he): and sort of a number of particles in economical, fairly quickly. This is now and generalized to make things a bit more interesting and

234
00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:27.180
David Schaich (he): generic. so, as we did before.

235
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.710
proceed by rewriting

236
00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:32.050
David Schaich (he): this replica system

237
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:41.630
David Schaich (he): in terms of occupation, numbers, and occupation probabilities. So you say that. or a small system of interest, that single replica.

238
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.260
David Schaich (he): we will assume it has

239
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.690
David Schaich (he): the accountable number. the microstates, and

240
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.530
David Schaich (he): range from 1, 2,

241
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.440
David Schaich (he): and then microstate over. I

242
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.780
David Schaich (he): no longer has a

243
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:10.250
David Schaich (he): fixed amount of energy or a fixed number of particles.

244
00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.120
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

245
00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.780
David Schaich (he): from microstates to microstate. So they say that

246
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:24.940
David Schaich (he): my E, I, you personal number and I,

247
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.350
David Schaich (he): hey? And it

248
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:32.480
David Schaich (he): for everything. We are going to do with the

249
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.180
David Schaich (he): we will actually

250
00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.650
David Schaich (he): fixed in case that

251
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:55.290
David Schaich (he): the this turns out to be the looks physically interesting. Use of the just. When you think about physical context in which we are able to create or destroy particles.

252
00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:01.570
David Schaich (he): those particles are necessarily in the one potential application

253
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:06.220
David Schaich (he): that we will get in some detail on the canonical case

254
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.820
David Schaich (he): where it is. you fixed number of particles, that

255
00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.470
David Schaich (he): and all period of labels.

256
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:18.960
David Schaich (he): So with this set up. yeah. same sort of

257
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:22.770
David Schaich (he): occupation, numbers

258
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.490
David Schaich (he): and occupation. And I,

259
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.940
David Schaich (he): my Api, is just

260
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:41.170
David Schaich (he): the occupation number.

261
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:52.490
David Schaich (he): So Ni is counting the number of replicas in the overall system. Yeah adults. Microsoft.

262
00:23:52.830 --> 00:24:02.990
David Schaich (he): and the corresponding credibility is the probability that if we choose the replica at random in that total system it will

263
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:06.250
David Schaich (he): be in microstate for me, I

264
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.760
David Schaich (he): So by these definitions, and as before.

265
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:20.410
David Schaich (he): from a number of microstates that we sum over all the occupation numbers all the different microstates we got.

266
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.270
I don't

267
00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:29.670
David Schaich (he): all of the different replicas. if we divide both sides of that identity by number of replicas.

268
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:40.940
David Schaich (he): confirmed that the occupation Probabilities are indeed both fine to probabilities that add up to 100% and the

269
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.120
David Schaich (he): whole energy and

270
00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:48.320
David Schaich (he): number of particles of this many. we can.

271
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:50.420
David Schaich (he): We write these

272
00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.760
David Schaich (he): in terms of the occupation numbers. The total energy

273
00:24:55.850 --> 00:25:02.280
David Schaich (he): is the so over the energies of each microstate

274
00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:07.750
David Schaich (he): number of replicas, they not that micro state, and similarly for

275
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:11.640
David Schaich (he): particles.

276
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.460
David Schaich (he): it was just Ni at times, and I

277
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.180
David Schaich (he): sorry about that that notation.

278
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:28.680
David Schaich (he): but at least the capitalization should make things what we're talking about. By the end of this exercise all of these

279
00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:35.170
David Schaich (he): replica-dependent quantities like occupation numbers in the occupation holiday. It should all drop out

280
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:44.600
David Schaich (he): any questions about not like a trick at all. You are

281
00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.400
David Schaich (he): going through for the second time, but it's good.

282
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.400
David Schaich (he): Most of the the last salt

283
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.570
David Schaich (he): so given. This set up

284
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:09.000
David Schaich (he): of occupation's, owners and occupation probabilities.

285
00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.230
David Schaich (he): What we want to do with this is compute

286
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.780
David Schaich (he): the temperature and chemical potential.

287
00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.300
David Schaich (he): Can you get a replica?

288
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:29.100
David Schaich (he): They are the same, or the full system, and any subsist to 0.

289
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.250
David Schaich (he): And

290
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.150
David Schaich (he): we will use this based on the

291
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:41.860
David Schaich (he): definitions of the temperature and chemical potential that we have in the microcontroller

292
00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.030
David Schaich (he): equilibrium.

293
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:48.050
David Schaich (he): So we have to look at the

294
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:55.950
David Schaich (he): full system, and a total that is governed by the microphonical, unsolvable. Yeah, we need

295
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.370
David Schaich (he): that full system to the

296
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:13.290
David Schaich (he): which, as always. because she. my maximizing the entropy that's total of the full system.

297
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.070
David Schaich (he): With me

298
00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:20.420
David Schaich (he): usual constraints on

299
00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:22.770
the Conservatives

300
00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:29.820
David Schaich (he): probability and energy and particle number they come from. In micro.

301
00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:34.920
David Schaich (he): So since we have defined

302
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:45.890
David Schaich (he): the occupation, numbers, and occupation, probabilities in exactly the same way as before, even though the corresponding microstates are different. And now they have different numbers.

303
00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:47.850
David Schaich (he): I've been to the particles

304
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:58.270
David Schaich (he): those different microstates get swept under under the rock. and the conversation of the 12, because it's only on

305
00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:11.470
David Schaich (he): the for some of our occupation numbers occupation. You may recall that the total number of microstates for this micro canonical system was the number of

306
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.630
David Schaich (he): ways that in one

307
00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:21.260
David Schaich (he): right, because the total r could be assigned it to microstate one.

308
00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:22.860
David Schaich (he): Okay.

309
00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:37.580
David Schaich (he): we have an end to another coefficients choosing and 2 ways for the remaining all minus one replicas, to be aside from the to, and so on, a telescope and product all the way up

310
00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:50.930
David Schaich (he): until the final microspace Guys was occupied by all the remaining. As you get on the side replicas and taking the

311
00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:53.260
David Schaich (he): this big ratio of factorials.

312
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.540
David Schaich (he): using approximation from Sterling's formula.

313
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.290
David Schaich (he): simple expression for total entropy

314
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:09.820
David Schaich (he): is the of occupation. Probabilities.

315
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.150
David Schaich (he): Times your logarithm.

316
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:17.720
David Schaich (he): the overall factor of the number of replicas out from.

317
00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:29.120
David Schaich (he): and the assumption that all and occupation numbers are much more. of course.

318
00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:36.180
David Schaich (he): and the maximization of the entropy proceeds as before.

319
00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:38.870
David Schaich (he): Change that we have to add

320
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.720
David Schaich (he): multiplier

321
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:51.030
David Schaich (he): to the procedure in order to account for the fluctuations of the particle number.

322
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:52.360
David Schaich (he): I'm all for you

323
00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:58.050
David Schaich (he): Microstates that lead to like, we're not these occupation capabilities.

324
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.650
David Schaich (he): so we will have a modified Entropy s bar that

325
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.960
David Schaich (he): starts all people to.

326
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:15.870
David Schaich (he): if you quickly, and it adds the usual straight on

327
00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.960
David Schaich (he): the occupation probabilities.

328
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:33.410
David Schaich (he): They all have to add up to one. We have that same constraint on the total energy. This there it is that total energy has to equal the

329
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:41.410
David Schaich (he): of the occupation numbers. We divide the energies. The occupation number is

330
00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:55.640
David Schaich (he): the P. I. I. That's equal the total energy. And then the new constraints has that same for David

331
00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:03.630
David Schaich (he): all times you I. It's a part of the number of which microstates

332
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:10.930
David Schaich (he): has to add up to the conserved total number of particles in our micro canonical system.

333
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.950
David Schaich (he): and as always, the

334
00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:17.430
David Schaich (he): extreme of of this modified entropy

335
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:22.720
David Schaich (he): are the same as those of the

336
00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:24.640
David Schaich (he): the

337
00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.960
David Schaich (he): of this modified test. Call with respect to

338
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:42.910
David Schaich (he): set that equal to 0 to find the maximum. And yeah, before. when we go through the

339
00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:45.520
David Schaich (he): you could have a delta function of the

340
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.330
David Schaich (he): I and K. Which

341
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.070
David Schaich (he): that will be over. I. It picks out

342
00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.670
David Schaich (he): the one on the case where I equals K.

343
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:08.870
One.

344
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:22.500
David Schaich (he): We get to build a function summed over. I also give us a one. It might as okay or

345
00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:23.750
David Schaich (he): okay.

346
00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:25.890
David Schaich (he): So

347
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:35.590
David Schaich (he): 3 of these sports rooms, and rearranging to here. one by itself

348
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:42.450
David Schaich (he): over our mine is

349
00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:57.000
David Schaich (he): so that the occupation probability itself. It's just the exponential of that. the minus over our

350
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:09.450
David Schaich (he): which we can we arrange as a ratio of exponentials?

351
00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:10.790
Sure.

352
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:16.120
David Schaich (he): Hopefully, it is okay familiar with it

353
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.000
David Schaich (he): my addition

354
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.600
David Schaich (he): in place.

355
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:30.200
David Schaich (he): The denominator, you a

356
00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:31.330
David Schaich (he): you

357
00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.110
David Schaich (he): or one over is that she?

358
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.420
David Schaich (he): You know the numerator is

359
00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:42.350
okay.

360
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.260
David Schaich (he): So this is

361
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.760
David Schaich (he): similar to what we had in the in our case, just with

362
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:58.300
David Schaich (he): a few more.

363
00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:11.070
David Schaich (he): Another term. That depends on the particle number and a different yeah mobilizing these occupation probabilities. So I hopefully. This point i'll just go ahead

364
00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:14.820
David Schaich (he): starting. Who's in it?

365
00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:23.080
David Schaich (he): Constraints that we have in particular. Can you constraints that all of these

366
00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:31.020
David Schaich (he): occupation that tells us this. what over the

367
00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:37.380
David Schaich (he): Microsoft I comes out of that stone.

368
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.100
David Schaich (he): you know. Rearranging these in the phones we find

369
00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:52.850
David Schaich (he): that she is a function of Beta and Gamma. It's just the sum over all microstates of this exponential factor.

370
00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.380
David Schaich (he): This is. yeah. create a canonical.

371
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:05.270
David Schaich (he): You know what

372
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:12.640
David Schaich (he): of the partition function that we are familiar with from the

373
00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.640
David Schaich (he): and to figure out

374
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:18.990
David Schaich (he): what the Beta and gamma appearing in this are

375
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.060
David Schaich (he): we charge ahead and

376
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.800
David Schaich (he): determine the temperature and chemical potential

377
00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.480
David Schaich (he): in the usual way. Indeed.

378
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:47.360
David Schaich (he): equilibrium. They come from partial derivatives of the entropy which we should express in terms. I, said she, so that full entropy for the whole system.

379
00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.880
David Schaich (he): What's this reason Why.

380
00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:57.490
David Schaich (he): that is odd? I'm just.

381
00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:03.220
David Schaich (he): And we just insert a result for occupation probabilities

382
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.170
David Schaich (he): into that logarithm.

383
00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:07.890
David Schaich (he): You will have

384
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.390
David Schaich (he): 3 terms

385
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:15.510
David Schaich (he): this product into the sum of 3 log rooms.

386
00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:22.460
David Schaich (he): So we have minus r times

387
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:27.350
David Schaich (he): the sum over. P. I. Times. The first logarithm is

388
00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:40.500
David Schaich (he): minus the exponential of minus Beta Uk just gives us.

389
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:42.530
I

390
00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.260
David Schaich (he): different label, some of the

391
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.990
David Schaich (he): which we

392
00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:00.820
David Schaich (he): can then just rearrange the sum over probabilities by themselves. On along the negative signs Cancel.

393
00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.550
David Schaich (he): Well.

394
00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.550
David Schaich (he): so

395
00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.570
David Schaich (he): we can recognize our times.

396
00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:19.940
David Schaich (he): The so of

397
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.510
David Schaich (he): P. I.

398
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:26.860
David Schaich (he): As one of the constraints that we imposed

399
00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:33.970
David Schaich (he): the starts. Yeah, cool. Yeah, she has

400
00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.580
computer.

401
00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:41.260
David Schaich (he): our times the sum of P. I. I must equal the total

402
00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.050
David Schaich (he): to see if some income will not put the subscripts

403
00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:48.390
David Schaich (he): for the on there. That would just be Beta times the energy.

404
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:55.650
David Schaich (he): my a total of a number. and

405
00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.640
David Schaich (he): sorry but that I go through that too quickly. Or Are you happy with

406
00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:03.070
yeah

407
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:04.770
David Schaich (he): results? So far.

408
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.360
David Schaich (he): not seeing any objections.

409
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.580
David Schaich (he): If this entropy try to keep it on the screen

410
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:23.030
for a minute

411
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.840
David Schaich (he): and

412
00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:25.140
put it into

413
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:30.180
David Schaich (he): yeah. partial.

414
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:36.620
David Schaich (he): inverse type of sure change in the

415
00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:37.830
entropy

416
00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:40.990
David Schaich (he): with respect to the energy, a fixed total number.

417
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:51.250
David Schaich (he): So in the first term. Yes. Grant and all the partition functions that she currently as a function of.

418
00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.740
David Schaich (he): So we have to.

419
00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:55.970
David Schaich (he): It's true.

420
00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.150
David Schaich (he): alright.

421
00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.390
David Schaich (he): it's to

422
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:05.300
and

423
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.160
David Schaich (he): parameters some overall factor of all

424
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:10.380
David Schaich (he): times.

425
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:12.810
David Schaich (he): The data

426
00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.540
David Schaich (he): same here.

427
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:24.750
David Schaich (he): Respect to

428
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.000
David Schaich (he): that we have

429
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:41.160
David Schaich (he): partial derivative with respect to itself, is just one

430
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.640
David Schaich (he): fixed particular number in

431
00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.480
respect to the

432
00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:59.060
David Schaich (he): So we dig into. say this partial derivative, of the all right.

433
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:04.020
David Schaich (he): that she is an economical, sufficient function.

434
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:10.440
David Schaich (he): I's

435
00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:16.550
David Schaich (he): the change rule, the oppression derivative of the arguments, the long as that she itself.

436
00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:37.920
David Schaich (he): the number to the the exponential function with respect to Beta, just brings down a minus E. I. Within that some of the microstates

437
00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:43.430
David Schaich (he): the exponential function remains unchanged.

438
00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:57.820
David Schaich (he): and you can recognize this as the overall negative sign some of the microstates of Ei. How is the year

439
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:04.600
David Schaich (he): Probability P. A. Which is the exponential factor normalized, by

440
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:08.680
David Schaich (he): which you recently

441
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.550
David Schaich (he): plug in

442
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:12.570
David Schaich (he): this stuff.

443
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:17.020
David Schaich (he): Writing down the entropy that some of

444
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:24.520
David Schaich (he): be the times I will. The is just that total energy.

445
00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:33.080
David Schaich (he): the total divided by the number of replicas in our system.

446
00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.820
David Schaich (he): Something very similar happens for

447
00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:44.430
David Schaich (he): the second partial derivative that we. this first factor

448
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.850
over zoom. She. It is

449
00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:52.000
David Schaich (he): the derivative with respect to Gamma on the exponential.

450
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:53.840
actually.

451
00:41:55.300 --> 00:42:00.600
David Schaich (he): that Gamma brings down a positive and I we some that over

452
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.980
David Schaich (he): all microstates weighted by it.

453
00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:15.820
David Schaich (he): you just end up with the total number of particles divided by R. And then these results. and to the

454
00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.410
David Schaich (he): expression that we have for the inverse temperature.

455
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:23.340
You end up with the

456
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.220
David Schaich (he): who else?

457
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:36.200
David Schaich (he): And let me

458
00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.760
In general?

459
00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:42.650
David Schaich (he): Yeah. The other 3 terms

460
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:45.680
David Schaich (he): are still the same as they would.

461
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.360
David Schaich (he): You can

462
00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.250
David Schaich (he): very nicely.

463
00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:02.350
David Schaich (he): Those terms are the same negative sign they cancel, they cancel.

464
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:16.180
David Schaich (he): and we find it might have yes, or expected from the not everyone's home. This the grounds multiplier. Beta is just the inver assemblage.

465
00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:23.710
David Schaich (he): We have one last

466
00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.740
David Schaich (he): few minutes for today

467
00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:28.960
David Schaich (he): it's a bit easier to

468
00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:34.530
David Schaich (he): go back to that definition of chemical potential and divide through

469
00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.010
David Schaich (he): by the

470
00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.980
David Schaich (he): negative temperature. Since that just gives us

471
00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.970
David Schaich (he): same. I can, just with the rules of

472
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:47.930
David Schaich (he): E and and the flick compared to the inverse temperature.

473
00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:52.480
David Schaich (he): So we can just rewrite that for all your expression.

474
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:05.800
David Schaich (he): one that we found to you minus u over r

475
00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.740
David Schaich (he): plus

476
00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:18.060
David Schaich (he): what I said she she is.

477
00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:22.440
David Schaich (he): and then plus the

478
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:30.680
David Schaich (he): the derivative of E itself, with respect to end, when you is fixed, vanishes

479
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:33.130
this

480
00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:38.530
David Schaich (he): and the by itself

481
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:40.600
the end.

482
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:44.460
David Schaich (he): See, as before.

483
00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.530
David Schaich (he): plus our

484
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.330
David Schaich (he): this one.

485
00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.560
And

486
00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.520
so one of the

487
00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.020
I left with

488
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:07.720
David Schaich (he): a simple results for our final

489
00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:15.140
David Schaich (he): you over to you. There's a negative sign there. this is up.

490
00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.430
It's not nice.

491
00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.100
David Schaich (he): So

492
00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.270
David Schaich (he): we have

493
00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.170
David Schaich (he): just barely in this hour gotten to

494
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.770
David Schaich (he): the desire. Result.

495
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:35.150
David Schaich (he): everything together.

496
00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.880
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

497
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.930
David Schaich (he): The microstate called release.

498
00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.040
David Schaich (he): with no reference to

499
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:59.130
David Schaich (he): any aspect of the

500
00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:13.390
David Schaich (he): and just to right results with everything. Yes, please.

501
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:19.670
David Schaich (he): Probably for Microsoft I. It's normalized by that Grand canonical partition function.

502
00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.010
an exponential actor

503
00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:24.740
David Schaich (he): of minus energy visa, I

504
00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:25.630
David Schaich (he): bye. Bye.

505
00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:28.690
David Schaich (he): what

506
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.890
David Schaich (he): in that microstate again, by the way.

507
00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:35.660
for sure.

508
00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.440
David Schaich (he): we can you right

509
00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:41.860
David Schaich (he): usually

510
00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.620
David Schaich (he): in this meeting. and all right.

511
00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:54.540
David Schaich (he): our efficient function is still is some overall microstates of

512
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:57.690
David Schaich (he): a generalization of the Boltzmann factor.

513
00:46:58.110 --> 00:46:58.690
David Schaich (he): let me know.

514
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:59.890
includes.

515
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:04.230
David Schaich (he): in addition to the the contribution of

516
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:08.470
David Schaich (he): a chemical potential which you can. Your number has

517
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:13.360
David Schaich (he): dimensions of energy, just like the How about you?

518
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:19.410
David Schaich (he): So from micro state to microstate

519
00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:25.680
David Schaich (he): with the energy and critical number all I to

520
00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:29.540
David Schaich (he): fluctuates and

521
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:32.340
David Schaich (he): the particle reservoir

522
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:41.430
David Schaich (he): the definition of the

523
00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:46.870
David Schaich (he): So in this room, like it is

524
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.960
David Schaich (he): simply unknownable

525
00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:52.680
David Schaich (he): except for

526
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.320
David Schaich (he): yeah.

527
00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:57.500
the fixes. That's true

528
00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.110
David Schaich (he): and chemical potential for us to start off with.

529
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:02.830
David Schaich (he): So

530
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:07.610
David Schaich (he): that is the

531
00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:13.130
David Schaich (he): Oh. we'll continue next week by driving something

532
00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:15.390
the usual qualities like

533
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.350
David Schaich (he): entropy and internal energy. And now particle

534
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:21.700
David Schaich (he): starting from this

535
00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.980
David Schaich (he): potential and then

536
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:29.700
David Schaich (he): going on already next week, start applying this to

537
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:33.210
David Schaich (he): awesome statistics doing a bit of introduction of

538
00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:44.060
David Schaich (he): those details just there, and also so that we don't need to have any prior. not with you, or experience with anything quantum to get the most out of it.

539
00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:49.660
David Schaich (he): This is a good place to software today. I will wrap up more or less on time.

540
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.290
David Schaich (he): Just see

541
00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:52.960
all right

542
00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:54.750
David Schaich (he): any questions

543
00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:57.440
David Schaich (he): before I let you

544
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:02.990
David Schaich (he): rest of your Tuesday.

545
00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:12.540
David Schaich (he): Good. Well, i'll see you again Thursday morning for next tutorial on

546
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.050
David Schaich (he): a few more thermodynamic cycles.

547
00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:18.020
David Schaich (he): petrol, and the Diesel engines

548
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:21.480
David Schaich (he): contracts between them.
