1
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.680
David Schaich (he): All right, we may as well get going today.  And let me just start with the

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:14.330
David Schaich (he): 6-digit attendance code this time: 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 5.

3
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.940
David Schaich (he): It's a bit smaller crowd than usual, though I

4
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.930
David Schaich (he): suspect some folks may be busy working on the computer project that's due tomorrow.  Are there

5
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.620
David Schaich (he): any questions about that, or about the homework for next week before we get under way?

6
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.050
David Schaich (he): I can also

7
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.640
David Schaich (he): expand that to ask if there any questions about what we covered last week.

8
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.900
David Schaich (he): This introduced

9
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.440
David Schaich (he): the micro-canonical ensemble, our first

10
00:00:50.080 --> 00:01:00.430
David Schaich (he): concrete realization of a statistical ensemble --- an example of a probability space that consists of a collection of degrees of freedom, or particles, that

11
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.530
David Schaich (he): evolve in time, randomly sampling the possible micro-states

12
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.360
David Schaich (he): of all those particles.  And characterized by

13
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.720
David Schaich (he): conserved qualities. In the case of the micro-canonical ensemble

14
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.750
David Schaich (he): there's a picture we can use to

15
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:30.370
David Schaich (he): recall what those conserved quantities are. If I zoom out to put it on the screen.  In the micro-canonical case, both the number of degrees of freedom (the particle number, N)

16
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.470
David Schaich (he): as well as the internal energy of the system. our conserved as time passes, and

17
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.080
David Schaich (he): the degrees of freedom adopt all of the possible microstates probabilistically.

18
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:52.830
David Schaich (he): and what this means in order to have energy conservation consistent with the first law thermodynamics is that any microeconomic ensemble has to be

19
00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:02.070
David Schaich (he): the isolated from the surroundings that shown on here as some insulation around it closed, be her with

20
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.380
David Schaich (he): a collection of particles bouncing around inside it. So there's no way to

21
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.960
David Schaich (he): exchange of the particles or energy with the outside world, which is the

22
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.090
David Schaich (he): they consider these

23
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.470
David Schaich (he): impractical. We' not to talk about physical experiments and making observations of these systems.

24
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.190
David Schaich (he): but it does provide a nice

25
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.010
David Schaich (he): sensible connection to that first law thermodynamics, the conservation of energy. We just impose that from the outset.

26
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.270
David Schaich (he): and

27
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:41.570
David Schaich (he): gives us a starting point to find important thermodynamical concepts like equilibrium.

28
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.640
David Schaich (he): We saw that thermodynamic equilibrium

29
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.160
David Schaich (he): is

30
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.530
David Schaich (he): smooth and steady, Large scale behavior of these systems, but it's still dynamic in the sense that the system continues

31
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.200
David Schaich (he): evolving from microstates microstates as time goes on. And it just

32
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.500
David Schaich (he): happens to be that all of those microstates that evolution produce the smooth behavior that we're used to

33
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:23.220
David Schaich (he): from it our everyday experience. This is intimately related to the concept of in a particular thermodynamic equilibrium. Can't be you.

34
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:32.510
David Schaich (he): It's fine bye. demanding that the is maximized. The entropy in general

35
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.210
David Schaich (he): it's the negative sum over

36
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.800
David Schaich (he): the probability of each micro State times. This logarithm

37
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.990
David Schaich (he): in the micro canonical case specifically, and for theatic equilibrium

38
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:57.650
David Schaich (he): I just maximize to the logarithm of the number of microstates and the identification of equilibrium with the state of maximum entropy is related to

39
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.000
David Schaich (he): so called second ball of thermodynamics.

40
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:08.350
David Schaich (he): that the entropy you use always now decreasing as time passes and generically increases.

41
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:24.170
David Schaich (he): and if there are no questions about that aspect of the those aspects of the microeconomical ensemble. What a plan for today is to actually wrap up material we have on the micro canonical ensemble which is defining

42
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:38.280
David Schaich (he): the temperature. Yes, a derived quantity. and you stop the conservative particle, number and energy. and also checking that the temperature behaved sensibly, as we would expect

43
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.200
David Schaich (he): again for everyday experience from

44
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.790
David Schaich (he): the process of heat exchange.

45
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.590
David Schaich (he): It will then move on to It's called the

46
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.200
David Schaich (he): See how it is easier to work with than the micro canonical case.

47
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.600
David Schaich (he): Also define.

48
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.320
Yes.

49
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.620
David Schaich (he): for the essential fundamental aspects, something known as

50
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.010
David Schaich (he): the partition function generating functional of various derived quantities, one of which

51
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.240
David Schaich (he): the heat capacity appears

52
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.110
David Schaich (he): on the homework assignment to a week from tomorrow, so I want to make sure to.

53
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.250
David Schaich (he): I touch on that today any questions before we get under way.

54
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.480
David Schaich (he): But with that what they do

55
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:45.120
David Schaich (he): the for sure. You know. the micro canonical ensemble is a derived quantity. like the entropy. so

56
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.800
David Schaich (he): also, like the

57
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.520
David Schaich (he): entropy, it should be

58
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.160
David Schaich (he): stable in from a dynamic equilibrium.

59
00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:03.600
David Schaich (he): As time goes on in the system evolves from the microstates to microstates.

60
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.980
David Schaich (he): so that is to say, that

61
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.960
David Schaich (he): the temperature, like the entropy, is

62
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.830
David Schaich (he): the function of the conserved quantities that

63
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:25.990
David Schaich (he): are required to be stable as yeah system of all

64
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.340
David Schaich (he): this but the temperature t it's a function of the conserved energy and particle number.

65
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:41.840
David Schaich (he): and we'll just go ahead, and you find the inverse temperature

66
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.950
David Schaich (he): actually to be

67
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.690
David Schaich (he): of the

68
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:53.460
David Schaich (he): on that. The energy in the system. with the particle number fixed. and

69
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.800
David Schaich (he): as this is defined in thermodynamic equilibrium, that's the case, we will focus on in general.

70
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.830
David Schaich (he): unless otherwise specified. we can relate this to

71
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.860
David Schaich (he): the total number of microstates 40. Given that one of

72
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.490
David Schaich (he): the energy and a fixed number of particles. So

73
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.810
David Schaich (he): this is maybe not the most obvious or intuitive.

74
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:25.040
David Schaich (he): There are some examples in the lecture notes that are they recorded

75
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:31.520
David Schaich (he): separately as a supplement. I want to make sure that we get through the key capacity.

76
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:37.860
David Schaich (he): Today we'll just politically say, what does this equation mean

77
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.940
David Schaich (he): that we think about adding energy here

78
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.930
David Schaich (he): to

79
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.410
David Schaich (he): a system

80
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:54.040
David Schaich (he): so technically moving from one micro canonical system to the next by increasing this energy.

81
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.180
David Schaich (he): if that produces a

82
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.120
David Schaich (he): large increase in

83
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.070
David Schaich (he): the entropy. Yes.

84
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:09.790
David Schaich (he): then this partial derivative is a large number with the number of particles fixed.

85
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.300
David Schaich (he): so the inverse temperature must be

86
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.990
David Schaich (he): small.

87
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.460
David Schaich (he): One over a small number becomes that large number.

88
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:37.240
David Schaich (he): and the same is true. If there's a small increase that corresponds to a large temperature. So hot systems with a high temperature are the ones for which, adding a bit more energy, this fixed collection of particles does not have

89
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:47.820
David Schaich (he): much effect on the entropy, or the number of microstates and cold systems are those in which, adding a little bit of energy. It does have a large effect.

90
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:48.800
David Schaich (he): which.

91
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:54.070
David Schaich (he): if you think about it, is sensible enough qualitatively

92
00:08:54.630 --> 00:09:01.450
David Schaich (he): the call system. You think of it as having less energy. So every little bit that is added has a bigger effect.

93
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.760
David Schaich (he): But maybe the

94
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:13.010
David Schaich (he): best way to check that. This kind of abstract definition in terms of microeconomical qualities is sensible is to

95
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.460
David Schaich (he): consider the process of heat exchange

96
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:25.190
David Schaich (he): between 2 systems. So we'll do this in 3 stages.

97
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.650
David Schaich (he): We start off with

98
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.800
David Schaich (he): to

99
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.510
David Schaich (he): isolated micro canonical systems

100
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:51.660
David Schaich (he): both of them are. and some of dynamic equilibrium. I'll call it one system a. Which is so number of particles in a

101
00:09:52.290 --> 00:10:00.940
David Schaich (he): energy E. A. That together determine its temperature. Ta: that we will assume to be greater than 0 just for simplicity.

102
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.920
David Schaich (he): Yeah, same with the

103
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:09.620
David Schaich (he): other system, just with the is replaced by bees.

104
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.260
David Schaich (he): That's on the

105
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:21.080
David Schaich (he): dot can now. And the second step is that we

106
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.590
David Schaich (he): put these 2 systems into thermal contacts

107
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:34.930
David Schaich (he): and wait some amount of time for the combined system to

108
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.540
David Schaich (he): equilibrium to

109
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.480
David Schaich (he): a single intensive temperature that is shared by

110
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:49.190
David Schaich (he): both of the subsystems that are now allowed to exchange energy.

111
00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.220
David Schaich (he): So This is

112
00:10:53.420 --> 00:11:00.350
David Schaich (he): similar to what we did last week when deriving the second law thermodynamics. We.

113
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.760
David Schaich (he): If I was overall combined system, i'll make a senior

114
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:14.900
David Schaich (he): where each of its 2 subsystems still have their fixed number of particles. but the energies

115
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.400
David Schaich (he): and the 2 systems can be

116
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.480
David Schaich (he): swapped from one side

117
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:26.720
David Schaich (he): to the other, and only the total energy e a plus you. The

118
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.530
David Schaich (he): is conserved

119
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.860
David Schaich (he): within this overall micro canonical system, Omega, c.

120
00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.800
David Schaich (he): So we wait some time for this overall system to

121
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.540
David Schaich (he): equilibrium for sure.

122
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.430
David Schaich (he): And then we we isolate

123
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.420
David Schaich (he): you 2 subsystems.

124
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.190
David Schaich (he): I decorate them now with

125
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.750
David Schaich (he): problems on all of these qualities. so

126
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:18.180
David Schaich (he): call it Omega, a prime, which is not necessarily the same.

127
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.140
David Schaich (he): is what we started off with Omega a. Because energy

128
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.550
David Schaich (he): may have been

129
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.970
David Schaich (he): exchange, and generically will have been exchanged between these 2 systems.

130
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.480
David Schaich (he): so there is some chance that E. A.

131
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:45.780
David Schaich (he): Will be the same as the initial.

132
00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:48.290
David Schaich (he): but

133
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:53.880
David Schaich (he): more generally what that energy and the corresponding temperatures may be different.

134
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.280
David Schaich (he): And we can ask, what do we expect

135
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:03.240
David Schaich (he): physically without doing any calculations, what we expect physically wrong?

136
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.580
David Schaich (he): This three-step process

137
00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.840
David Schaich (he): and

138
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.180
David Schaich (he): that will just

139
00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:19.010
David Schaich (he): go ahead and write down my expectations hopefully. You will

140
00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.280
David Schaich (he): agree with

141
00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.120
David Schaich (he): that.

142
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:31.660
David Schaich (he): If one of the initial subsystems is hotter than the other. one is hover, one is colder, we would expect energy

143
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.460
David Schaich (he): to flow

144
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.010
David Schaich (he): probably harder system

145
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.670
David Schaich (he): to the colder one.

146
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:49.570
David Schaich (he): reducing the temperature of the hotter system, raising the temperature of the colder system and bringing them into

147
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.710
David Schaich (he): plus for alignment. So if you have, say a cup of coffee, and you or some

148
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.630
David Schaich (he): oh, milk into it. you expect us 2 systems to

149
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:09.850
David Schaich (he): come together to a temperature in between. The coffee gets cooler, you know it gets warmer. It's not the best example, because the particles there are mixing, but it's a familiar one

150
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.480
David Schaich (he): from every day

151
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.620
easily generalizable to

152
00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:20.400
David Schaich (he): this case. So now let's actually do the mathematical calculation

153
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.000
David Schaich (he): to check that

154
00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:31.700
David Schaich (he): our definition of the temperature, and produces that intuitively expected behavior.

155
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.820
David Schaich (he): So the way to do this we're calling

156
00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.800
David Schaich (he): our definition of the inverse temperature.

157
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:47.630
David Schaich (he): we will need to figure out the entropy of the system, how they depend on the energies.

158
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.360
David Schaich (he): and see what that produces for

159
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.580
David Schaich (he): the temperature.

160
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.220
David Schaich (he): And from the second law

161
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:13.230
David Schaich (he): of thermodynamics we know that the entropy of these 2 systems, as time goes on. can never decrease and generically increases. So

162
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:19.520
David Schaich (he): the total entropy in that first stage of 2 isolated subsystems with

163
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.520
David Schaich (he): energies. Ea.

164
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:28.740
David Schaich (he): I'll ignore the particle numbers, because that's those are just fixed throughout the trivial.

165
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:41.990
David Schaich (he): In that first stage we know the entropy has to be no larger than the entropy of the mine system. We call the entropy the extensive quality that just adds across our systems

166
00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:46.590
David Schaich (he): the entropy of the combined system right to help

167
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:58.790
David Schaich (he): like that. It depends on the total energy at between the 2 that is conserved. and this in turn can be no larger. and the final entropy

168
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.940
David Schaich (he): of the systems with

169
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.470
David Schaich (he): E. A. Prime

170
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.810
David Schaich (he): once they have been. we isolated in that final stage.

171
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:20.360
David Schaich (he): Now see what

172
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:24.890
David Schaich (he): make use of this. We need some way to connect

173
00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:25.960
David Schaich (he): the you

174
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.660
David Schaich (he): entropy as functions of

175
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:39.260
David Schaich (he): it's called engineering subscripts. S. For system, System a and B. You

176
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.310
David Schaich (he): entropy start the energy E. A prime and eb. Prime

177
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.770
David Schaich (he): will just be the initial energy, the a or e

178
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:49.830
David Schaich (he): plus

179
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:56.780
David Schaich (he): some delta e. The amount of energy that is exchanged with the first law of thermodynamics.

180
00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.560
David Schaich (he): guaranteeing that

181
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:08.099
David Schaich (he): the amount of energy, that the amount by which the energy changes in each system is equal and opposite

182
00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:14.270
David Schaich (he): Delta E. B is negative, the energy on one side increases.

183
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.550
David Schaich (he): It has to come from the other side. I'm. Just there for decreases.

184
00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:26.339
David Schaich (he): and assuming for simplicity that this change is relatively small compared to the total.

185
00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:33.850
David Schaich (he): This is can be done without all in generality, because, if it's not the case, we can imagine going to computing this process several times.

186
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:41.400
David Schaich (he): we a small changes that I at all you can but functions of the energy through

187
00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:48.910
David Schaich (he): you, Taylor expansion something like. should you have seen before. Possibly not for

188
00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.980
David Schaich (he): a while. The entropy in system

189
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.130
David Schaich (he): is the best after we isolation is

190
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.630
David Schaich (he): the entropy of that original energy plus delta e.

191
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:11.880
David Schaich (he): which is the original entropy. plus its partial derivative

192
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:17.750
David Schaich (he): with respect to the energy evaluated

193
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:29.570
David Schaich (he): for the initial. multiply it bye the change in energy. and then up to these small corrections.

194
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.510
David Schaich (he): beginning with delta e squared that we can. What

195
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:46.240
David Schaich (he): this does assume that the entropy is continuous, differentiable function of the conservative quantities. which

196
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:51.370
David Schaich (he): is the case, except that what I call first order phase transitions which we'll get to after

197
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:52.870
David Schaich (he): the Easter break.

198
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:57.620
David Schaich (he): So for now that assumption holds, and

199
00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:04.020
David Schaich (he): from the definition of it's not for sure as the derivative of

200
00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.390
David Schaich (he): the inverse temperatures from the

201
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.770
David Schaich (he): you now have. hey? Nice

202
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:24.540
David Schaich (he): connection between the entropy after we actually the systems at the end of that 3 step process and the initial energy

203
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.850
David Schaich (he): along with the initial temperature

204
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:34.210
David Schaich (he): T. A. And TV so plugging that in to our inequalities. From the second off

205
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:48.810
David Schaich (he): we have with the sum s of the a and Smb. Has to be less than or equal to 2 of our expansions

206
00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:54.270
David Schaich (he): approximate symbol, just because i'm dropping the high order terms on that line.

207
00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:04.680
David Schaich (he): We have S. Of E. A. Prime. That's a. V a plus delta the a. Over T. A.

208
00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.460
David Schaich (he): And then. similarly for

209
00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.840
David Schaich (he): system, Omega v. Prime, it has to be

210
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:32.500
David Schaich (he): so. There's lots of cancellations and no just with the statement that. And still to ebay

211
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:37.030
David Schaich (he): over t a plus delta eb, which

212
00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:40.140
David Schaich (he): is the negative of Delta E

213
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:46.190
David Schaich (he): over TV has to be greater than

214
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:55.610
David Schaich (he): or equal to 0, or just pulling out that overall factor. the differences

215
00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:59.000
David Schaich (he): of the inverse temperatures multiplied by

216
00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.850
David Schaich (he): the change. The energy of the initial system

217
00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:08.960
David Schaich (he): has to be a non-negative number, and will be a positive number, except in

218
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:13.590
David Schaich (he): the very special and unusual circumstances.

219
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.060
David Schaich (he): So there are

220
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:22.080
David Schaich (he): 3 cases that we could consider.

221
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.100
David Schaich (he): First possibility is that

222
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:29.510
David Schaich (he): the initial temperature in system a is larger than that and System B.

223
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:34.050
David Schaich (he): So it's in verses smaller. You are subtracting a

224
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:40.700
David Schaich (he): larger inverse from a smaller inverse. We come out with the overall negative number in the parentheses.

225
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:45.810
David Schaich (he): so the other number also generically needs to be negative

226
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.110
David Schaich (he): people here for the product to be non-negative.

227
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:58.190
David Schaich (he): that is, delta e they less than 0. So the energy in this 3 step procedure

228
00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.900
David Schaich (he): is flowing from

229
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.890
David Schaich (he): the hotter system

230
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.880
David Schaich (he): Omega 8 with the water temperature. Ta

231
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.210
David Schaich (he): to

232
00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:22.320
David Schaich (he): colder system will make it be just as we expect, lowering the higher temperature and reason the lower temperature.

233
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.830
David Schaich (he): Similarly, if we

234
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.920
David Schaich (he): this reverse this inequality. And suppose this

235
00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:42.450
David Schaich (he): system B and the larger temperature to start off with, then we have a larger, inverse, minus a smaller inverse, so a positive

236
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.110
David Schaich (he): value in the parentheses

237
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.460
David Schaich (he): that requires the positive

238
00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:52.190
David Schaich (he): change in the energy of system. Ea, in order to get a positive product.

239
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.480
David Schaich (he): So that is the

240
00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:01.500
David Schaich (he): same behavior. The energy is flowing from the hotter system in this case only to be

241
00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.290
David Schaich (he): to

242
00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.350
David Schaich (he): system, which is Omega a.

243
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:17.150
David Schaich (he): And the final case is the very special case where the initial temperatures were equal. There is that

244
00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:23.000
David Schaich (he): no energy flow? And this is the special situation in which the

245
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:29.580
David Schaich (he): inequality saturated. We actually have no change in the

246
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:34.730
David Schaich (he): and the flow of the energy. No change in the temperature either.

247
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:43.910
David Schaich (he): So they are all people. They state people. all the issues behaving as you would expect, and connecting that

248
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.470
David Schaich (he): definition mathematically in terms of the

249
00:23:47.700 --> 00:24:01.070
David Schaich (he): energy dependence of the entropy to usual familiar, everyday behavior. So any questions about temperature or heat exchange in the micro canonical ensemble.

250
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:12.370
David Schaich (he): You may already be anticipating the next step which ones

251
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.540
David Schaich (he): the the question that

252
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.060
David Schaich (he): I put up on getting set up for you to think about

253
00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:23.090
David Schaich (he): that with the complete isolation of microeconomic.

254
00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:31.600
David Schaich (he): this allow any change in their energy or any exchange of energy with their surroundings.

255
00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.270
David Schaich (he): It turns out to be

256
00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:44.060
David Schaich (he): essentially impossible to observe these systems from the outside. There's no way to make an observation without exchanging some energy or particle in the system.

257
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:50.610
David Schaich (he): and since we don't want to include ourselves in a system of, say, gas particles

258
00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:58.890
David Schaich (he): with a fixed amount of energy microeconomical system, despite it's nice connection to The first and second law of thermodynamics

259
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:05.200
David Schaich (he): is in practice not terribly useful, because that energy conservation is never

260
00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:10.770
David Schaich (he): realize in the physical experiments that we want to describe mathematically.

261
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.680
David Schaich (he): so they much more useful approach

262
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.610
David Schaich (he): is known as the economical ensemble

263
00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.020
David Schaich (he): sacrifice. The direct connection to the first law of thermodynamics.

264
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:30.940
David Schaich (he): With

265
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.010
David Schaich (he): Yeah, more

266
00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.890
David Schaich (he): practical economical way of setting things up

267
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.240
David Schaich (he): that complete isolation

268
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:48.280
David Schaich (he): from the environment demanded by the microconic on some one. It's not realistic.

269
00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.380
David Schaich (he): So instead, we will work with

270
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.400
David Schaich (he): not a call ensemble.

271
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:05.800
David Schaich (he): It's characterized

272
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.710
David Schaich (he): the longer by

273
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:17.430
David Schaich (he): a conserved energy. but instead I fixed temperature

274
00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.130
t

275
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:25.710
David Schaich (he): and the same

276
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.020
David Schaich (he): sure particle number.

277
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:38.050
David Schaich (he): and it's the microeconomic a well sample, and which is a much less stringent condition. You've already been thinking about

278
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.340
David Schaich (he): heat exchange between 2

279
00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:44.570
David Schaich (he): subsystems of the micro canonical ensemble

280
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:52.830
David Schaich (he): where it's fairly easy to say, make an air kind of container that can serve as aable number, but it doesn't require that the energy be

281
00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.940
David Schaich (he): completely insulated.

282
00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:00.130
David Schaich (he): So we keep the conserved particle number, condition, and we add to it the condition of

283
00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:01.800
David Schaich (he): it. Fixed temperature.

284
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:08.340
David Schaich (he): which raises the question of how do we imagine that temperature can be fixed.

285
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.830
David Schaich (he): So the component part I. The definition of the

286
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.430
David Schaich (he): is that this fixed temperature is realized.

287
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.810
David Schaich (he): Thermal contact

288
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.790
David Schaich (he): with its surroundings. the so called thermal reservoir.

289
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.440
David Schaich (he): which is sometimes

290
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:47.960
David Schaich (he): there's a key path. so a picture that we can have in here. It was

291
00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:53.630
David Schaich (he): doing an experiment with a collection of gas particles and some container in our lab.

292
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.460
David Schaich (he): The gas particles in that container is the

293
00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:02.330
David Schaich (he): system of interest described by the economical ensemble and the rest of our lab. The

294
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:13.060
David Schaich (he): they are in the environment. That it is in thermal contact with. It is fixing its temperature and allowing us to treat it as economical, ensemble

295
00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:18.610
David Schaich (he): with a fixed temperature rather than fix energy.

296
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.810
David Schaich (he): Now, this still actually

297
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:29.370
David Schaich (he): as a remnant of the micro canonical ensemble in it. Because if we consider that

298
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:32.100
David Schaich (he): system and

299
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:35.140
David Schaich (he): it's environment

300
00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:49.250
David Schaich (he): in combination. So I call the system Omega. Call that reservoir. They'll make it red overall system. The total oh, make up

301
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.270
David Schaich (he): This remains

302
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.890
David Schaich (he): Micro Cannot Nicole.

303
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.010
David Schaich (he): and in particular, that means that

304
00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:04.340
David Schaich (he): the total energy of the system, plus and thermal reservoir

305
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:18.500
David Schaich (he): which we've seen, energy is. and extensive quantity, adding across those subsystems that remains conserved. We have a closed system of which we're just looking at

306
00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.960
David Schaich (he): a small heart

307
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:23.770
David Schaich (he): in particular, the energy e of

308
00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:27.800
David Schaich (he): economical system, Omega. It's allowed to

309
00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:32.290
David Schaich (he): by exchanging energy with this reservoir.

310
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:35.130
David Schaich (he): The idea is that the

311
00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.560
David Schaich (he): fluctuations of the canonical system and this reservoir

312
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:47.720
David Schaich (he): are such that any fluctuations in them do not change the

313
00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:57.100
David Schaich (he): temperature, which is an intensive quality, the same across all of the subsystems, independent of the subsystem size.

314
00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:08.810
David Schaich (he): you know a key step to having the economical ensemble makes sense. To be something that we can work with mathematically

315
00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:17.170
David Schaich (he): is that we don't want to always have to rely on stepping up to the combined system plus reservoir

316
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:22.790
David Schaich (he): total, that for me. It's micro-canonic couple days that first of all thermodynamics.

317
00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:29.620
David Schaich (he): We need to show that's the details

318
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.750
David Schaich (he): how the rest of you are

319
00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.520
David Schaich (he): don't actually matter

320
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.860
David Schaich (he): 2, the canonical system, Omega.

321
00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.910
David Schaich (he): And if we can do that, that will allow us to just consider

322
00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:56.010
David Schaich (he): as economical, unsolvable

323
00:30:56.610 --> 00:31:01.240
David Schaich (he): rather than part of a much bigger.

324
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.160
David Schaich (he): all clear so far

325
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:09.120
David Schaich (he): it's a bit more definitions.

326
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:14.620
David Schaich (he): a definite goal for us to pursue.

327
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.960
Yeah, the main road, the

328
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:35.770
David Schaich (he): first half of today's lecture. The way that we can do this. which is a trick introduced by Miller, gives in the early 19 hundreds

329
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.580
David Schaich (he): on the founders on the

330
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.630
David Schaich (he): Statistical Physics and its connections to thermodynamics

331
00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:45.160
David Schaich (he): is known as

332
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:47.700
David Schaich (he): the replica trick.

333
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:51.480
David Schaich (he): which is.

334
00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:55.870
David Schaich (he): or, I guess. for the form of

335
00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:02.040
David Schaich (he): that large several reservoir which we will then use to show that

336
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:08.530
David Schaich (he): the form we are guessing. It's not actually that. So we we'll let

337
00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:13.590
David Schaich (he): this reservoir the a large number

338
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.850
David Schaich (he): of copies of the system of interest.

339
00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.420
David Schaich (he): I'll say this composed of

340
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.570
David Schaich (he): R. Minus one replicas for copies.

341
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:31.420
David Schaich (he): So if we had, you know Mega as the final one, the total system.

342
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:37.530
David Schaich (he): Omega total is accounting for our total copies that we assume is a large number.

343
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.930
David Schaich (he): All of these replicas all right

344
00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.250
David Schaich (he): in full contact with each other.

345
00:32:50.580 --> 00:33:00.340
David Schaich (he): and and through it equilibrium with each other. So the overall system is in front of every equilibrium, as

346
00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:04.090
David Schaich (he): is all of its, or as all its subsystems.

347
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.470
David Schaich (he): So

348
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:16.760
David Schaich (he): what this on thoughts does is guarantee that the reservoir is a physically sensible system, without having to

349
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.770
David Schaich (he): specify what particular system that is.

350
00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:29.580
David Schaich (he): If we are interested in any given system, Omega, whether that's a system of spins pointing up or down, or a collection of particles in some container.

351
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.280
David Schaich (he): Then a large number of copies of that is going to be just as

352
00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:42.450
David Schaich (he): physical and just as reasonable to talk about. So the sense that says, we're not doing anything special.

353
00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:43.690
David Schaich (he): With this setup

354
00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.420
David Schaich (he): we are

355
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:56.890
David Schaich (he): ensuring a reasonable system about specifying it. and we can right down that that total energy of the system.

356
00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:00.460
David Schaich (he): plus the reservoir

357
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:05.850
David Schaich (he): is by extensivity

358
00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:15.440
David Schaich (he): just the sum over our all our of these replicas. So I think this one, through our have

359
00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.170
David Schaich (he): some value of the energy E of our.

360
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:26.020
David Schaich (he): You can pick out one of those to be our system of interest with energy, and all the rest come up with the form.

361
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:29.440
David Schaich (he): The reservoir that we hope will

362
00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:31.790
David Schaich (he): fix the temperature

363
00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:36.719
David Schaich (he): of the system without need to know any further details.

364
00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:44.280
David Schaich (he): You can now turn this on his head, and just a bit.

365
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.650
David Schaich (he): and

366
00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:53.989
David Schaich (he): you find an energy e sub. I rather than e sub r

367
00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.780
David Schaich (he): energy of

368
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:05.320
David Schaich (he): and corresponding microstates

369
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:15.690
David Schaich (he): we call Omega I. And in particular this is a microstate of

370
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:18.420
David Schaich (he): our system of interest, of which we have

371
00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:20.910
David Schaich (he): our replicas in total.

372
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:28.350
David Schaich (he): And because these the system is in contact with this reservoir.

373
00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:37.240
David Schaich (he): the energy is no longer conserved. Different microstates can have different energy, and can be adopted by exchanging energy between the system

374
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:40.500
David Schaich (he): and the surrounding reservoir.

375
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:44.680
David Schaich (he): And based on this, we will define

376
00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:49.130
David Schaich (he): the occupation, number

377
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.190
David Schaich (he): and supply

378
00:35:55.110 --> 00:36:01.720
David Schaich (he): to be the number of replicas out of the our tool

379
00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.670
David Schaich (he): that adopt

380
00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:13.470
David Schaich (he): this particular microstate omega to I. So All of these replicas are copies

381
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.460
David Schaich (he): of our system that make up. They are all

382
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:24.350
David Schaich (he): in microstates of that system at any point in time. Say we have a finite number in microstates as usual.

383
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.860
David Schaich (he): and we've a list.

384
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:31.820
David Schaich (he): We count how many of these replicas are

385
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:42.930
David Schaich (he): in each of the microstates at any point in time. So that means that you saw

386
00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.820
David Schaich (he): from one to M

387
00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.160
David Schaich (he): of the occupation number, for each microstate

388
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:59.120
David Schaich (he): has to account for all of the replicas in all of the microstates and total number of

389
00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.410
David Schaich (he): the rest of you are.

390
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:16.550
David Schaich (he): The total energy can now be rewritten, not. or both, as some over all our replicas. but also as the sum over all M. Microstates

391
00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:22.780
David Schaich (he): of the You. Energy, e sub. I. Of that microstate. Multiply it by

392
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:26.480
David Schaich (he): the number of times that microstate appears

393
00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.110
David Schaich (he): among the

394
00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.810
David Schaich (he): and

395
00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:50.630
David Schaich (he): I'm. Just deciding whether or not to give an example. I think I we have time

396
00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.550
David Schaich (he): for that before the break before I do

397
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.300
David Schaich (he): also consider dividing this relation

398
00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:01.300
David Schaich (he): by our on both sides.

399
00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:08.810
David Schaich (he): and give us us shifting things back into view. Sum over, I.

400
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:14.490
David Schaich (he): Of the occupation number is a fraction of the total number of replicas

401
00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:21.140
David Schaich (he): is something that we can call P. Sub. I. That adds up to one like a probability.

402
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:24.970
David Schaich (he): So this piece of I.

403
00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:28.870
David Schaich (he): It finds

404
00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:39.970
David Schaich (he): occupation, probability, and based on the occupation number. which we should interpret as the probability that if we

405
00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:43.670
David Schaich (he): choose a replica at random, it is in

406
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.160
David Schaich (he): microstates, or make it some, I

407
00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:53.850
David Schaich (he): and we will end up by reinterpreting this occupation. Probability, once we

408
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.590
David Schaich (he): show that the

409
00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:00.460
David Schaich (he): form of the reservoir and its replicas are

410
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:05.400
David Schaich (he): irrelevance to the overall to the canonical system.

411
00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.170
David Schaich (he): So we have occupation, numbers, and occupation probabilities.

412
00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.550
David Schaich (he): Just to quickly make this

413
00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:20.370
David Schaich (he): concept a little more concrete. You can consider it very. very small example of Hey: yeah.

414
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:28.570
David Schaich (he): Canonical system. So a system just of 2 spins that has 2 to 2 or 4 micro States

415
00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:29.690
David Schaich (he): sorry.

416
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:33.760
David Schaich (he): highlighted in red the system

417
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:36.640
David Schaich (he): Omega that we're interested in. We then have

418
00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:44.930
David Schaich (he): R. Minus one copies or replicas on that system that we put in surrounding it; and the idea is that

419
00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:49.120
David Schaich (he): all of these replicas are exchanging

420
00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:55.740
David Schaich (he): energy with each other in with the original system, internal contact in several equilibrium.

421
00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.310
David Schaich (he): We're assuming that the 2 spins in the system are distinguishable.

422
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:13.230
David Schaich (he): let's call it you a important topic next week. But that how does that be? Microstates with

423
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:23.160
David Schaich (he): a downward, pointing spin on the left, and the upper pointing spin on the right are distinct from those would be down reporting spin on the right, and the other parting on the left.

424
00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.610
David Schaich (he): so we can easily catalog

425
00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:29.720
David Schaich (he): the 4 micro States.

426
00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:41.440
David Schaich (he): both spins, pointing up. That's been pointing out right from pointing down vice versa. and those things pointing down call it

427
00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:47.630
David Schaich (he): the corresponding occupation number.

428
00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:53.690
David Schaich (he): counting the system as well as the reservoir. You see to

429
00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:58.080
David Schaich (he): replicas that are in this first

430
00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:00.450
David Schaich (he): micro.

431
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.270
David Schaich (he): See another 2 that have

432
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:10.950
David Schaich (he): up on the left and right down on the right. I see

433
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.090
David Schaich (he): finally 2

434
00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:18.160
David Schaich (he): that have the opposite pattern down the left, up on the right.

435
00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:25.270
David Schaich (he): and then 3 that are both down. and we can check that the some over

436
00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:36.160
David Schaich (he): the occupation number something over all of the different microstates. 2 plus 2, 3 is 9,

437
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.460
David Schaich (he): which is indeed the number of replicas that we are looking for.

438
00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.750
David Schaich (he): and perhaps the

439
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:47.240
David Schaich (he): Yes.

440
00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:54.470
David Schaich (he): Yeah. So this is very simple example that I don't think is going to inspire any

441
00:41:54.620 --> 00:42:08.030
David Schaich (he): questions. But it. It was straightforward. and we justify the next claim that for you overall system what I should call the system

442
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:17.090
David Schaich (he): reservoir. that will make a total is fully specified

443
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.890
David Schaich (he): bye

444
00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.940
David Schaich (he): those that of them

445
00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:27.780
David Schaich (he): occupation numbers.

446
00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.340
David Schaich (he): So yeah.

447
00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:35.840
David Schaich (he): number of replicas in each

448
00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:50.840
David Schaich (he): of the M. Microstates. or equivalently the animal occupation probabilities. The probability that you randomly chose and replicate on microstates.

449
00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:59.960
David Schaich (he): So we can ask, based on the definition that we introduced at the start of the day.

450
00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.740
David Schaich (he): What is the temperature

451
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:12.200
David Schaich (he): of this overall micro canonical system

452
00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.330
David Schaich (he): that's defined by

453
00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:30.940
David Schaich (he): for you derivative of the entropy of that total system, with all our replicas divided by it's total energy with a fixed number of

454
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:33.190
David Schaich (he): and particles.

455
00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:35.730
David Schaich (he): And

456
00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:39.780
David Schaich (he): because we assumed thermodynamic equilibrium

457
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:55.200
David Schaich (he): energy derivative of the the total number of microstates across all our of those replicas. and before the break I think we have

458
00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:57.930
David Schaich (he): plenty of time to

459
00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.890
David Schaich (he): figure out what the total number of microstates is

460
00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:11.170
David Schaich (he): which you can do what? Just by counting the

461
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:15.170
David Schaich (he): number of ways.

462
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:21.310
David Schaich (he): Yeah to you all replicas can be arranged.

463
00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.830
David Schaich (he): The set of occupation. Numbers yes.

464
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.290
David Schaich (he): specify the system.

465
00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:39.000
David Schaich (he): so we have it all replicas. We want to sort them

466
00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.870
David Schaich (he): into a set of. and

467
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:47.170
David Schaich (he): my occupation numbers.

468
00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:55.930
David Schaich (he): So there are. and of these occupation

469
00:44:56.010 --> 00:45:01.360
David Schaich (he): numbers that we want to pick out from among the

470
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:06.190
David Schaich (he): so we can start with any given one of those occupation numbers

471
00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:08.610
David Schaich (he): so mathematically.

472
00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.850
David Schaich (he): We want first to choose. say, and one

473
00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.080
David Schaich (he): of these replicas that are in

474
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:22.450
David Schaich (he): microstates, omega, one of the

475
00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:25.200
David Schaich (he): the small system that is replicated.

476
00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:31.940
David Schaich (he): and the way of choosing. and one of the our replicas to be in that microstate is

477
00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:37.750
David Schaich (he): exactly the

478
00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.050
David Schaich (he): So that is just part of the

479
00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:46.790
David Schaich (he): calculation. Yeah.

480
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:59.060
David Schaich (he): the next step is just to repeat this process for the remaining micro-states and remaining occupation numbers. If we move on to

481
00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:05.350
David Schaich (he): microstates omega 2, we have n 2 of those out of the remaining replicas so.

482
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:10.600
David Schaich (he): and one of the replicas had already been assigned to Micro State one.

483
00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:14.030
David Schaich (he): Our minus and one remain, and you want to choose.

484
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:17.700
David Schaich (he): and 2 of those to be in micro state, and 2

485
00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:20.730
David Schaich (he): that you suspect

486
00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:26.430
David Schaich (he): R. Minus n, one minus n 2 microstates I wish to choose, and 3,

487
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:29.980
David Schaich (he): and so on up until the end.

488
00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.320
David Schaich (he): and so em

489
00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:34.410
David Schaich (he): occupation number, which will be

490
00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.590
David Schaich (he): necessarily

491
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:43.000
David Schaich (he): only determined by being identified with all of the remaining

492
00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:45.150
David Schaich (he): microstates that

493
00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.200
David Schaich (he): have not yet been assigned to any of the other.

494
00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:56.880
David Schaich (he): So any of all the remaining replicas that have been assigned to any of the other micro states

495
00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.300
David Schaich (he): so

496
00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:01.880
David Schaich (he): hopefully that makes sense as I talked it through

497
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:07.160
David Schaich (he): from this point, so mathematical manipulation from the definition of

498
00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:10.080
David Schaich (he): coefficients

499
00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.700
David Schaich (he): that first our shoes and one factor is the

500
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:24.840
David Schaich (he): ratio of our factorial by and one factorial on this R minus one factorial

501
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:31.130
David Schaich (he): next has. and one factorial choosing and 2

502
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:34.890
David Schaich (he): factorial, the

503
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:37.340
David Schaich (he): the other factor in the denominator.

504
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:46.810
David Schaich (he): moving on our minus one minus and 2 from the numerator with, and 3 factorial

505
00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:57.660
David Schaich (he): in the to 3 actually all the way up to. And so yeah.

506
00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:05.300
David Schaich (he): So what we have is a telescoping correct

507
00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:08.770
David Schaich (he): another day, telescoping some in each

508
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:16.480
David Schaich (he): pair of terms. The numerator of the second cances out one of the factors in the denominator of the first.

509
00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:21.380
David Schaich (he): and leaves us just with the first factor of our

510
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:23.690
David Schaich (he): and then all of the remaining

511
00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:24.910
David Schaich (he): and one

512
00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:32.510
David Schaich (he): factorial and 2 factorial and 3 factorial all the way up to.

513
00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:36.210
David Schaich (he): And so then factorial in the denominator.

514
00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:46.540
David Schaich (he): So that is the total number of microstates for

515
00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:52.460
David Schaich (he): the micro canonical combination of our system of interest, plus this reservoir.

516
00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:56.420
David Schaich (he): thanks to this replica trick.

517
00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:02.380
David Schaich (he): and that will be our starting point for figuring out

518
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.600
David Schaich (he): the remainder of the calculation of the temperature. After

519
00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:10.500
David Schaich (he): Hey, we've break from the question so far about the

520
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:14.780
David Schaich (he): set up for this replica trick, for the number of microstates

521
00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.690
David Schaich (he): computed for that overall combined system.

522
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:30.090
David Schaich (he): Not seeing a deal pause, the recording it's something to drink and be back

523
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:32.810
David Schaich (he): at 10

524
00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:36.330
David Schaich (he): second half of of this morning's lecture.

525
00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:55.460
David Schaich (he): Okay, I think it's time to proceed. Okay. we break for reflection. Now. you any answer questions about what we've seen so far today.

526
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:59.800
David Schaich (he): not seeing any of the

527
00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.940
David Schaich (he): next step that we have on our way to figuring out the temperature

528
00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.060
David Schaich (he): is to

529
00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:13.850
David Schaich (he): If the logarithm of this total number of microseconds we calculated. and then try to figure out how it depends.

530
00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:17.710
David Schaich (he): Total energy of our canonical system.

531
00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:20.860
David Schaich (he): reservoir of replicas

532
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.790
David Schaich (he): and.

533
00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:29.130
David Schaich (he): thanks to the properties of

534
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:30.970
David Schaich (he): logarithms.

535
00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:39.590
David Schaich (he): we can break up the logarithm of this

536
00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.130
David Schaich (he): ratio of factorial products into

537
00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:49.990
David Schaich (he): the difference between the log of the numerator. minus the

538
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:55.540
David Schaich (he): log of the denominator. It's a log of a product which becomes a sum.

539
00:50:55.990 --> 00:51:01.460
David Schaich (he): The floors we you from one to M. Of

540
00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:08.420
David Schaich (he): the occupation number and supply factorial within the logarithm.

541
00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:11.360
David Schaich (he): Now, if we

542
00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.980
David Schaich (he): assume we are dealing with a

543
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:23.060
David Schaich (he): large number of particles and a large number of replicas. the usual say before physical physics.

544
00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:28.310
David Schaich (he): and it's different than the what we look at is just 2 spins.

545
00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:34.600
David Schaich (he): You can assume that all of the occupation numbers are large. So there's a

546
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:39.780
David Schaich (he): you, an arbitrarily large number. That's a finite number of replicas.

547
00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:44.050
David Schaich (he): and this assumption allows us

548
00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:45.030
David Schaich (he): to

549
00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:50.880
David Schaich (he): apply service approximation

550
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:56.850
David Schaich (he): to

551
00:51:57.290 --> 00:52:01.540
David Schaich (he): the logarithm of it factorial, which is.

552
00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:10.160
David Schaich (he): is that a familiar term. Maybe if I write it down. Yes. total is approximately

553
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:22.470
David Schaich (he): minus car minus the So over I okay, similar. and I

554
00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:33.530
David Schaich (he): minus. And I so that this really is for me what the long of a large factorial is

555
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.620
David Schaich (he): in this case. Our factory is

556
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:39.900
David Schaich (he): our our minus r plus corrections.

557
00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:45.130
David Schaich (he): No one is subject to that. So it's something you may have seen before.

558
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.860
David Schaich (he): and if not, there is a tutorial activity that

559
00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.880
David Schaich (he): actually go through the derivation of this, as well as the

560
00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.590
David Schaich (he): small correction terms to it.

561
00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:57.600
David Schaich (he): Of the

562
00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:04.440
David Schaich (he): what this allows us to do at this level of approximation is the call that

563
00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.550
David Schaich (he): the sum over all the

564
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:16.120
David Schaich (he): microstates of the occupation number has to be equal to the total number of replicas

565
00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:28.240
David Schaich (he): relative negative sign between those 2. So those terms cancel out. and you can also express the occupation number itself

566
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.470
David Schaich (he): as the

567
00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:33.300
David Schaich (he): products of the occupation, probability.

568
00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:36.600
David Schaich (he): and the total number of replicas in the remaining

569
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:41.840
David Schaich (he): term in the so it's this expression

570
00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:58.420
David Schaich (he): some now over R. Times, P. I mean I can come down with some there and then the logarithm of P. I. Times are.

571
00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:02.750
David Schaich (he): Let me see you one with one rhythm of the product.

572
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:05.110
I can see some

573
00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:06.730
David Schaich (he): of log rhythms.

574
00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.370
David Schaich (he): and

575
00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:15.940
David Schaich (he): since these occupation probabilities, like all probabilities, sum up to one

576
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:23.160
David Schaich (he): the our Api log, our term the P. I. Drops out. That's equal to one.

577
00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:27.640
David Schaich (he): We have a second factor of our with with

578
00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:31.000
David Schaich (he): the negative sign compared to that first factor.

579
00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:39.640
David Schaich (he): and we are left with just our factors of

580
00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:44.440
David Schaich (he): some over the single system. Entropy

581
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:51.230
David Schaich (he): P. I. Of the Roots microstates I. From one to N.

582
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:08.080
David Schaich (he): Now the question is. how do we get this expression for the entropy

583
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:13.340
David Schaich (he): express in terms of the energy, so that we can take its derivative.

584
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:17.020
David Schaich (he): and find this temperature. The

585
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:22.150
David Schaich (he): energy dependence is implicit in here. Next to

586
00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:34.840
David Schaich (he): that, that. the total energy that we want to take the derivative, with respect to is just a so of occupation. Number Times Microstate Energy or

587
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.260
David Schaich (he): Rpi Times, e. I. Somebody is hiding there.

588
00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:42.550
David Schaich (he): The question is how to get it out.

589
00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:52.830
David Schaich (he): We, and trick to do that which it's not necessarily obvious to look at. It is to apply what we know about

590
00:55:56.490 --> 00:56:00.470
David Schaich (he): equilibrium for the overall

591
00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:05.350
David Schaich (he): system of

592
00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:08.540
David Schaich (he): it's reservoir.

593
00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:12.010
David Schaich (he): that is, micro canonical, but just in general.

594
00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:14.330
David Schaich (he): we know that

595
00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:18.830
David Schaich (he): some dynamic equilibrium corresponds to

596
00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:22.870
David Schaich (he): the maximum entropy given the constraints

597
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.330
David Schaich (he): that's probability here

598
00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:34.750
David Schaich (he): and in the case of the whole system, energy

599
00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:42.900
David Schaich (he): are conserved that back under the screen there. so the overall system with our replicas

600
00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:45.390
David Schaich (he): has to be subject to

601
00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:50.530
David Schaich (he): conservation of energy. I see micro canonical setup.

602
00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:54.530
David Schaich (he): The occupation probabilities

603
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.950
David Schaich (he): we have seen also have to be conserved to add up to 100%

604
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:04.220
David Schaich (he): and maximizing the entropy subject to

605
00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.330
David Schaich (he): these 2 constraints, you just

606
00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:10.170
David Schaich (he): a very similar procedure to what we did

607
00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:13.400
David Schaich (he): last week when derived David.

608
00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:23.830
David Schaich (he): The expression for thermodynamic equilibrium to the market economic ensemble. Just from this second law of thermodynamics that identifies the equilibrium

609
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:27.430
David Schaich (he): system as one with maximum entropy.

610
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:39.580
David Schaich (he): We introduce the drums multipliers and consider the modified energy that starts off with the so a lot of an entropy that starts off with the total entropy

611
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:41.570
David Schaich (he): of these all replicas

612
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.050
David Schaich (he): our.

613
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:52.270
David Schaich (he): And then, as that 2 Lagrange multipliers, one

614
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:56.620
David Schaich (he): that enforcing the

615
00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:01.470
David Schaich (he): conservation for probability. I believe it's all I have to set up to one.

616
00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:05.650
David Schaich (he): and the second

617
00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:09.200
David Schaich (he): just refute later simplicity

618
00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:11.820
David Schaich (he): requires that the

619
00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:14.430
David Schaich (he): so

620
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:17.220
David Schaich (he): i'll see you

621
00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:21.290
David Schaich (he): energies weighted by the occupation probabilities.

622
00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:33.220
David Schaich (he): times, ours, the occupation number of times. The energy has the to the total energy that is conserved in the micro canonical system.

623
00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:38.810
David Schaich (he): I think there is

624
00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:41.130
David Schaich (he): space

625
00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:44.050
David Schaich (he): here just to quickly take the

626
00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:47.320
David Schaich (he): derivative of this modified entropy

627
00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:53.070
David Schaich (he): with respect to an arbitrary one of those occupation Probabilities want to

628
00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:57.050
David Schaich (he): maximize this set the derivative equal to 0.

629
00:58:57.790 --> 00:59:03.220
David Schaich (he): It's also easy to check that. The second derivative. Is negative which we oh, skipped last week. But

630
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:05.740
David Schaich (he): you can do on your own

631
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:10.640
David Schaich (he): the derivative of P. I.

632
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:14.360
David Schaich (he): Same expression we worked with last week, the overall factor

633
00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:15.780
David Schaich (he): minus R.

634
00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:20.170
David Schaich (he): We get a chronic or delta. I. K.

635
00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:24.030
David Schaich (he): The derivative of P. I. The

636
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:26.060
right

637
00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:27.290
David Schaich (he): changes the

638
00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:33.480
David Schaich (he): index, i. To K. And the only remaining term that survives from that big sum.

639
00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:37.780
David Schaich (he): Similarly, a ek

640
00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:40.780
David Schaich (he): divided by the derivative

641
00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.430
David Schaich (he): it is.

642
00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:46.060
David Schaich (he): you can pull out

643
00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:53.030
David Schaich (he): a chronic or delta, I. K. This sum of the first Lagrange, multiplier.

644
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:56.190
comic, or delta, gives us one

645
00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:59.800
David Schaich (he): when I equals K. And 0 the rest of the time

646
01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:03.690
David Schaich (he): it's. Similarly. there you go.

647
01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:13.020
David Schaich (he): Delta, I. K. Gives us minus beta, all right. E. K. From the second.

648
01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.900
David Schaich (he): the branch multiplier.

649
01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:21.320
David Schaich (he): So all of that those 3 terms something to 0 we can rearrange to

650
01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.840
David Schaich (he): isolate that log

651
01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.430
David Schaich (he): E. K. Factor

652
01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.460
David Schaich (he): that will have on the other side

653
01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:32.730
David Schaich (he): a minus one we divide through.

654
01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.940
David Schaich (he): The other. Term is by minus R.

655
01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:47.480
David Schaich (he): And i'll shift them to the other side of the equal sign. You get a plus alpha over R. The cars canceled out there meeting us with a minus data.

656
01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:49.830
David Schaich (he): Okay.

657
01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:54.560
David Schaich (he): actually go ahead.

658
01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.040
David Schaich (he): In addition to

659
01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.980
David Schaich (he): next, she trying to keep both on the screen at once.

660
01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:08.580
David Schaich (he): We exponentiate both sides. We have an expression for the occupation probability

661
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:14.700
David Schaich (he): in terms of these 2 Lagrange multipliers, alpha and Beta.

662
01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.480
David Schaich (he): It's the exponential.

663
01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:19.280
David Schaich (he): These 3 terms.

664
01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:20.960
actually minus

665
01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:27.620
David Schaich (he): one minus L. Over R. Mine is the in K.

666
01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:41.770
David Schaich (he): So I've written in that way, so that I can rearrange it to exponential of divided by the exponential of the positive factor, one minus

667
01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:44.770
David Schaich (he): also over all that that

668
01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:51.390
David Schaich (he): e to the negative x. It's one over e to the plus x.

669
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.130
David Schaich (he): and about change variables

670
01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:58.670
David Schaich (he): and define a an alternative parameter Z.

671
01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:03.520
David Schaich (he): That is the exponential of one minus alpha over r

672
01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:12.310
David Schaich (he): the E. To the minus beta. E. K. Comes along with Roy.

673
01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:15.720
David Schaich (he): so

674
01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:18.690
David Schaich (he): you have an expression for

675
01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:23.400
David Schaich (he): the occupation, probabilities in thermodynamic equilibrium

676
01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:25.990
David Schaich (he): in terms of 2

677
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:29.790
David Schaich (he): and cross, multiplier parameters, Beta and Z,

678
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:31.170
David Schaich (he): that we can

679
01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.900
David Schaich (he): in a grip on by composing

680
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.530
David Schaich (he): you constraints that we started off with.

681
01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:51.100
David Schaich (he): That's how we get back from the modified and for the to the true entropy as total that we want to maximize.

682
01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:58.340
David Schaich (he): so demand that you occupation probabilities all some up to one.

683
01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:01.180
David Schaich (he): How is this? Just that

684
01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:12.140
David Schaich (he): one over said so? All of these exponential factors? E. To the minus Beta. the I equals one.

685
01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:24.330
David Schaich (he): and if we multiply that through. and we find is that as a function of beta, it is just some overall

686
01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:31.560
David Schaich (he): of the microstates of the canonical system, the exponential minus state of the times, the I.

687
01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:34.840
David Schaich (he): This is known as

688
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:37.760
David Schaich (he): the partition function.

689
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:41.930
David Schaich (he): and turns out to be

690
01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:43.960
David Schaich (he): the fundamental

691
01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:55.690
David Schaich (he): quantity that really characterizes a canonical system, and from which all of the derived quantities of interest, like the

692
01:03:56.030 --> 01:04:02.270
David Schaich (he): internal energy and heat, capacity, or entropy, can be dropped. This is

693
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:03.240
yeah

694
01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:15.020
David Schaich (he): quantity that it will be seeing repeatedly as we first wrap up the derivation of the canonical ensemble. Again. apply the economical ensemble to you various

695
01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:19.130
David Schaich (he): examples and situations.

696
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:23.340
David Schaich (he): The other constraint is that

697
01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.460
David Schaich (he): in total energy has to be given by

698
01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:36.700
David Schaich (he): that sum over occupation numbers for our times. P. I. Weighted by the energy e. I. Of each microstate.

699
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:42.300
David Schaich (he): and what we can do here if we were to.

700
01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:47.040
David Schaich (he): So I get what we have for P. I. Is now a

701
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:54.350
David Schaich (he): ratio of an exponential factor, divided by a sum of exponential actors where you get basically a mess.

702
01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.220
David Schaich (he): But if we insert this into

703
01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:00.510
David Schaich (he): the year

704
01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:07.140
David Schaich (he): expression for the entropy that we had. and minus R

705
01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:13.350
David Schaich (he): times, the some of the microstates of P. I. From the occupation probabilities

706
01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.950
David Schaich (he): you can insert

707
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:29.230
David Schaich (he): our results for the occupation probabilities inside that logarithm. So pi it's one over the partition function times the exponential.

708
01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:32.960
David Schaich (he): even the minus data e. I

709
01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:43.360
David Schaich (he): If we break up that log of the product into a sum of 2 logs. We have

710
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:48.840
David Schaich (he): the minus R Times log of one over Z.

711
01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.540
David Schaich (he): We have

712
01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:55.310
David Schaich (he): all all independent of I. They some

713
01:05:55.870 --> 01:06:01.440
David Schaich (he): P. Of I. Over a microstate i. Which add up to one as always.

714
01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:10.490
David Schaich (he): Then we have. The second factor is a minus r times, the logarithm of the to the minus beta times the energy

715
01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:14.730
David Schaich (he): It's just it's argument.

716
01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:17.890
David Schaich (he): So we have a minus R. Times minus beta

717
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:22.890
David Schaich (he): plus our data. they some over

718
01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:28.440
David Schaich (he): probabilities weighted by the energy, is going down

719
01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:31.700
David Schaich (he): from that exponential factor, or, in other words.

720
01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:40.610
David Schaich (he): imposing the constraints that are as a some p. I. E. As up to the total energy

721
01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:46.590
David Schaich (he): we have, that the total energy, this whole entropy is

722
01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:51.650
David Schaich (he): maybe the Times. This tool energy, plus an additional term

723
01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:53.890
David Schaich (he): of the.

724
01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:56.070
David Schaich (he): and this is

725
01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.830
David Schaich (he): where we wanted to get. In order to

726
01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:12.450
David Schaich (he): take the derivative and determine the inverse temperature. I will drop the total subscripts just for use of writing for the time being. So one over temperature

727
01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:18.320
David Schaich (he): is Dsde, fixing the number of particles

728
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:23.300
The easiest derivative to take is

729
01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:30.360
David Schaich (he): with respect to itself that we use that multiplicative factor of Beta, our Lagrange multiplier.

730
01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:37.180
David Schaich (he): But we also need to account for the possibility that Beta itself depends on energy.

731
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:41.600
David Schaich (he): just like everything else. Indeed. micro canonical system that

732
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:48.710
David Schaich (he): we are currently analyzing from Omega plus its reservoir.

733
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:51.900
David Schaich (he): R is just a number.

734
01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:55.770
David Schaich (he): The number of replicas about Z.

735
01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:09.480
David Schaich (he): You have seen is yeah. involves the energy. and is also cast as a function of Beta. So it will be useful to

736
01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:13.420
David Schaich (he): take the derivative of log. Z. That gives us

737
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:26.840
David Schaich (he): all right over, said times by the changing one, the derivative of Z itself. With respect to E. You've written that as a function of data. So we will take

738
01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:32.590
David Schaich (he): derivative in the Chamber with respect to data. another factor of

739
01:08:33.979 --> 01:08:35.470
David Schaich (he): derivative of

740
01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:41.640
David Schaich (he): with respect to the energy at same factor that showed up the other term.

741
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:46.830
David Schaich (he): So what can we do with this?

742
01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:51.960
David Schaich (he): The best thing to do is apply

743
01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:56.200
David Schaich (he): the definition of the partition function that we have

744
01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:57.770
David Schaich (he): come up with.

745
01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:02.960
David Schaich (he): We consider one over. Z.

746
01:09:04.779 --> 01:09:07.939
David Schaich (he): You said you pay now and

747
01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:14.649
David Schaich (he): plug in that some of over all microstates.

748
01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:23.680
David Schaich (he): I We pick up a factor of negative E. I.

749
01:09:25.210 --> 01:09:27.290
David Schaich (he): Inside that. So

750
01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:30.540
David Schaich (he): the exponential factor

751
01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:38.960
David Schaich (he): is unaffected by the derivative and we can recognize.

752
01:09:39.779 --> 01:09:44.930
David Schaich (he): and that one over Z is exponential of minus a times the energy.

753
01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:58.430
David Schaich (he): the you occupation, probability that we computed from maximizing the entropy. So this is a factor of negative. Some P. I.

754
01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:01.720
David Schaich (he): Times, e. I. Which

755
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:15.000
David Schaich (he): constraint is still on the screen is negative. Total energy divided by the number of replicas. All right. so plugging that into

756
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:19.690
David Schaich (he): our calculation for the inverse temperature is the derivative.

757
01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:21.000
Entropy

758
01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:22.860
David Schaich (he): we have it.

759
01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:26.400
David Schaich (he): Let's see

760
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:37.200
David Schaich (he): us, our times, whatever it is that the beta is minus here over our.

761
01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:39.050
David Schaich (he): and then there's a

762
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.520
David Schaich (he): the energy there.

763
01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:48.100
David Schaich (he): our signs one of our it cancels off, and we have Yeah.

764
01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:58.100
David Schaich (he): and remarkably simple results. That's the temperature

765
01:10:58.110 --> 01:11:02.380
David Schaich (he): is just one over this with large multiplier data.

766
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:07.450
David Schaich (he): So

767
01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.540
David Schaich (he): what we have at this point

768
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:20.360
David Schaich (he): is, in fact, our final expression

769
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:21.500
David Schaich (he): for

770
01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:24.460
David Schaich (he): economical system.

771
01:11:27.730 --> 01:11:29.070
David Schaich (he): What is new

772
01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:36.840
David Schaich (he): either as the gives distribution or

773
01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:40.900
David Schaich (he): the Boltzmann distribution. as always in

774
01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.430
thermodynamic

775
01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.570
David Schaich (he): equilibrium.

776
01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:46.870
David Schaich (he): we have a

777
01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.560
David Schaich (he): probability piece of I

778
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:52.820
David Schaich (he): that is, one over z

779
01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:56.720
David Schaich (he): e to the minus energy over T

780
01:11:57.030 --> 01:12:01.610
David Schaich (he): for the corresponding micro state back on the screen there

781
01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:07.030
David Schaich (he): and then. The partition function is the sum over all microstates

782
01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:09.890
David Schaich (he): of the minus energy over T

783
01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:14.710
David Schaich (he): and one over T itself. We can also call Beta the

784
01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:16.320
David Schaich (he): inverse temperature.

785
01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:24.010
David Schaich (he): So this is also known as the Boltzmann distribution, and this exponential factor.

786
01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:27.290
David Schaich (he): so it's it's specifically.

787
01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:28.590
David Schaich (he): No.

788
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:32.120
David Schaich (he): as the Boltzmann factor.

789
01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.370
David Schaich (he): And what we can do now is note that

790
01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:46.960
David Schaich (he): in this gives distribution there is no longer any explicit

791
01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:54.360
David Schaich (he): reference to our ons offs before the reservoir that was fixing the temperature

792
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:57.240
David Schaich (he): one over beta work

793
01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.640
David Schaich (he): our economical system.

794
01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.640
David Schaich (he): so we can interpret this P. I

795
01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:10.720
David Schaich (he): no longer has in occupation, probability.

796
01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.130
David Schaich (he): but as a microstate probability.

797
01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:24.220
David Schaich (he): the probability for it.

798
01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:28.380
David Schaich (he): our system of interest, Omega.

799
01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:32.990
David Schaich (he): to adopt the corresponding microstates.

800
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.330
David Schaich (he): Little Omega

801
01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.480
David Schaich (he): and

802
01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:51.620
David Schaich (he): microstate has energy, e sub i. That is

803
01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.550
David Schaich (he): no water conserved.

804
01:13:58.530 --> 01:14:03.700
David Schaich (he): So we have reached the goal that we set out before the break.

805
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:10.770
David Schaich (he): We have an expression for our system, Omega in terms of a fixed temperature.

806
01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:25.410
David Schaich (he): and the non-conserved energies of the corresponding microstates. and all of the details of the reservoir that we bye use the rep like a trick to come up with an exhaust force that ons up is now irrelevant

807
01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:27.110
David Schaich (he): and even.

808
01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:31.590
David Schaich (he): and in the canonical approach.

809
01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:33.170
David Schaich (he): Apart from

810
01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:45.430
David Schaich (he): fixing this temperature T. And for dynamic equilibrium all the details of that not only it irrelevant, but also just unknowable in principle.

811
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.890
David Schaich (he): You just know it has

812
01:14:54.450 --> 01:14:56.260
David Schaich (he): fixed temperature

813
01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:12.650
David Schaich (he): that economical system picks up, thanks to the temperature being and intensive quality. So that is the derivation of the economic ensemble in from dynamic.

814
01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.690
David Schaich (he): from maximizing the entropy

815
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:17.700
David Schaich (he): which gives us an expression for

816
01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:21.380
David Schaich (he): microstate probabilities and the partition function

817
01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:23.560
David Schaich (he): that

818
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:28.370
David Schaich (he): is the starting point for deriving any other quantity of interest.

819
01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:30.700
David Schaich (he): Any questions about

820
01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:38.590
David Schaich (he): the fairly long, like the information that we went through to to get to this point.

821
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:56.660
David Schaich (he): So if you're all happy with that. that, so it starts arriving

822
01:15:58.030 --> 01:16:00.470
David Schaich (he): interesting quantities.

823
01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:02.710
David Schaich (he): the canonical ensemble.

824
01:16:12.710 --> 01:16:16.820
David Schaich (he): So back in the micro canonical ensemble, as we saw actually at the

825
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.300
David Schaich (he): very beginning

826
01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:25.230
David Schaich (he): for lecture today, the temperature is one of you survive products that depends on

827
01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:29.660
David Schaich (he): it can serve energy that characterizes the micro canonical ensemble.

828
01:16:31.050 --> 01:16:34.920
David Schaich (he): The canonical approach turns that on his head.

829
01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:45.450
David Schaich (he): We now have the temperature fixed. and the energy of the system is fluctuating in thermodynamic equilibrium, as the system keeps probabilistically adopting

830
01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:53.050
David Schaich (he): one microstate after the next. But there is a well defined

831
01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.910
David Schaich (he): quantity of that energy. They may be here

832
01:16:59.330 --> 01:17:02.510
David Schaich (he): expectation value, the expected value.

833
01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:06.120
David Schaich (he): I'll be in trouble, energy.

834
01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:22.220
David Schaich (he): something that we can derive now based on the fixed temperature so right that, as always in the angular brackets for expectation, value of the energy.

835
01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:30.590
David Schaich (he): Note that it is a function of temperature, also a function of particle number that we can leave implicit.

836
01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:37.880
David Schaich (he): just because we're used to the particle number being conserved in both the micro canonical economical cases.

837
01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:39.470
David Schaich (he): And then it.

838
01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:45.970
David Schaich (he): Definition of the expectation value is, as always, the

839
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:50.270
David Schaich (he): some over all of the outcomes in our outcome space.

840
01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.550
David Schaich (he): That's because the some

841
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:56.130
all of our microstates, let's say there are some of them

842
01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:04.940
David Schaich (he): of the quality is expectation value we are considering. So the energy E of I. In Microsoft, omega i.

843
01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:09.030
David Schaich (he): We did by the probability of the system adopting

844
01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:14.240
David Schaich (he): this Microsoft Omega, I. With the energy.

845
01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:16.640
David Schaich (he): So we know the

846
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:22.980
David Schaich (he): probabilities in the not for what sample or given by the use distribution.

847
01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:25.740
David Schaich (he): You can plug that in. I'm gonna be

848
01:18:28.330 --> 01:18:32.500
David Schaich (he): I Independence partition function factor out front

849
01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:41.740
David Schaich (he): and be left with the energy waited by each of the minus beta times the energy

850
01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:48.420
David Schaich (he): which actually, if we look back to

851
01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.500
David Schaich (he): calculations that we were doing to figure out the temperature.

852
01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:56.110
David Schaich (he): Okay.

853
01:18:57.070 --> 01:19:04.330
David Schaich (he): see this one over, said some energy times exponential pulsing factor appearing

854
01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:18.330
David Schaich (he): being related to the negative all of one over Z, the derivative of a set with respect to data not too surprisingly carrying out that derivative with respect to David, just brings down

855
01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:26.150
David Schaich (he): that energy so plenty of that negative sign. it comes along with it. since one of

856
01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:30.560
David Schaich (he): he's in. he made up.

857
01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:33.310
David Schaich (he): which

858
01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:45.060
David Schaich (he): we consider the chain rule is just the inverse temperature. Derivative i'll be you logarithm of the partition function.

859
01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:48.100
David Schaich (he): So this is an illustration of

860
01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:52.240
David Schaich (he): the importance of that partition function I was hinting at earlier.

861
01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.750
David Schaich (he): is taking the

862
01:19:54.890 --> 01:20:05.340
David Schaich (he): temperature, or probably inverse temperature. Derivative The logarithm of the partition function gives us the expectation value for the internal energy of

863
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:07.010
David Schaich (he): economical system.

864
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:09.170
David Schaich (he): and

865
01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:13.270
David Schaich (he): is worthwhile to ask. Given that the energy is now

866
01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.500
David Schaich (he): a function of the temperature.

867
01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.490
David Schaich (he): How exactly does

868
01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:23.010
David Schaich (he): the energy

869
01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:27.090
David Schaich (he): expectation value? Yeah.

870
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:35.160
David Schaich (he): Depend on the temperature team?

871
01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:42.730
David Schaich (he): This is.

872
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:45.320
David Schaich (he): in the sense the

873
01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:51.790
David Schaich (he): same question and principle that we looked at we're talking about heat exchange, we thought.

874
01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:54.390
David Schaich (he): How does the temperature depend on the energy?

875
01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:58.900
David Schaich (he): Does it rise or fall as the amount of energy

876
01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:01.740
David Schaich (he): increases or decreases.

877
01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:15.890
David Schaich (he): and to answer the question of how the energy now depends on the temperature that characterizes economical ensemble. You can define

878
01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:18.140
David Schaich (he): the quantity.

879
01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:21.950
David Schaich (he): No, that's the

880
01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:33.510
David Schaich (he): each capacity. C sub b, which is the derivative of the energy, expectation, value. With respect to the temperature

881
01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:36.660
David Schaich (he): and

882
01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:40.270
David Schaich (he): in the homework assignment to next week

883
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:49.390
David Schaich (he): you will show the Pd. Capacity is not negative. It is to say that higher temperatures

884
01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:55.170
David Schaich (he): never decrease the

885
01:21:57.060 --> 01:22:04.010
David Schaich (he): internal energy, and generically you will see that the quality holds only in very special

886
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:16.830
David Schaich (he): and specific cases. So generically. the higher temperature needs to a larger internal energy which is

887
01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:27.880
David Schaich (he): in nice alignment with what we would expect based on our everyday experience with concepts of energy and temperature.

888
01:22:30.730 --> 01:22:32.200
David Schaich (he): I'll see that

889
01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:34.590
David Schaich (he): the way to

890
01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:40.580
David Schaich (he): drive this and she may have already seen if you look at homework is by

891
01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:45.940
David Schaich (he): providing this heat capacity to

892
01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:50.550
David Schaich (he): the fluctuations of microstate energies around

893
01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:57.420
David Schaich (he): this expectation value, so e on one, is the expectation value squared. This is a

894
01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.870
David Schaich (he): an example of a

895
01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:18.090
David Schaich (he): general and and quite powerful aspect of statistical physics. Notice fluctuation, response relations where

896
01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:24.880
David Schaich (he): the fluctuations around the expectation value

897
01:23:24.930 --> 01:23:31.200
David Schaich (he): are related to the response of that expectation value to the change in

898
01:23:31.290 --> 01:23:34.610
David Schaich (he): some parameter that defines the system. In this case the

899
01:23:34.630 --> 01:23:38.750
David Schaich (he): temperature that defines the canonical on song.

900
01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:52.930
David Schaich (he): One other thing to mention just in passing is that the subscript be on the heat capacity is there because we're assuming that the

901
01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:55.810
David Schaich (he): volume of the system is

902
01:23:56.470 --> 01:24:07.190
David Schaich (he): staying fixed in this definition that put into the definition here as an explicit constraint, because you're not yet included the volume

903
01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:09.750
David Schaich (he): as an explicit parameter

904
01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.290
David Schaich (he): in a thermodynamic system that something

905
01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:19.330
David Schaich (he): get to, Probably in a couple weeks time, certainly before the break will look at thermodynamic cycles.

906
01:24:20.450 --> 01:24:29.630
David Schaich (he): and you more of. or the interrelations between pressure, volume. temperature, and energy.

907
01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:35.020
David Schaich (he): There is an alternative key capacity that counts the pressure of C sub p.

908
01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:41.230
David Schaich (he): Which I will show up in that context. and a different only slightly from

909
01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:44.960
David Schaich (he): C sub b. So in both cases the derivative

910
01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:48.950
David Schaich (he): of the average internal energy with your stuff in the temperature.

911
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:52.960
David Schaich (he): keeping either the joining or the pressure fixed.

912
01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:02.240
David Schaich (he): So that should give you a

913
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:06.560
David Schaich (he): everything you need for the homework requirements, and we can move on to

914
01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:15.830
David Schaich (he): other interesting derived quantities. you know, like a ensemble. one of which, of course, is. do you entropy?

915
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:18.500
David Schaich (he): We consider this in

916
01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:23.550
David Schaich (he): the derivation of the with reference to

917
01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:29.860
David Schaich (he): the various replicas, you know, on a large thermal reservoir.

918
01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:35.780
David Schaich (he): We now want to derive the entropy based on

919
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.600
David Schaich (he): micro State probabilities, with no reference to

920
01:25:39.630 --> 01:25:40.960
David Schaich (he): the unknowable.

921
01:25:41.230 --> 01:25:44.160
David Schaich (he): The whole reservoir. So we go back to

922
01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:49.190
David Schaich (he): the general definition. The entropy is

923
01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:59.760
David Schaich (he): the negative sum over P. I. I. For the microstate capabilities. Yeah. And we can plug in our gives distribution for

924
01:26:00.150 --> 01:26:03.300
David Schaich (he): one of those factors of Pi.

925
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.370
David Schaich (he): So as before I one over the partition function.

926
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:10.280
David Schaich (he): the exponential

927
01:26:10.770 --> 01:26:14.800
David Schaich (he): Boltzmann factor E. To the minus beta Times energy.

928
01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:17.490
David Schaich (he): and again

929
01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:27.520
David Schaich (he): breaking up the log of the product into the sum of walks. We have. you know. negative.

930
01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:38.930
David Schaich (he): What is that? I'm just over all probabilities, adding up to one. So here is it what I said.

931
01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:44.370
David Schaich (he): The other term is the log of the exponential. So just the argument comes down

932
01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.760
David Schaich (he): 2 negative factors.

933
01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:50.770
David Schaich (he): They I independence

934
01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:59.900
David Schaich (he): Beta, multiplying the sum of the microstates of the microstate.

935
01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:07.160
David Schaich (he): Well, that is just the definition of the internal energy expectation value.

936
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:15.540
David Schaich (he): So we have a more than a partition function plus expectation value

937
01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:20.210
David Schaich (he): times, data, the inverse temperature, or currently divided

938
01:27:20.290 --> 01:27:21.470
David Schaich (he): by the temperature.

939
01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:27.640
David Schaich (he): We can also rearrange this to express the

940
01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:31.060
David Schaich (he): internal energy, expectation, value is

941
01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:40.510
David Schaich (he): the Temperature Times. The entropy. By this in times of the of the partition function.

942
01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:45.760
David Schaich (he): And this way of writing things.

943
01:27:48.250 --> 01:27:50.070
David Schaich (he): We're calling that the

944
01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:53.600
David Schaich (he): energy and

945
01:27:55.500 --> 01:28:03.470
David Schaich (he): entropy are themselves functions of the temperature actually motivates introducing a new concept.

946
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:18.230
David Schaich (he): So we have temperature, times, entropy. What what is known as a free energy, a little call app. It's just this quantity. The negative Temperature Times, the logarithm of the partition function.

947
01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.090
David Schaich (he): and

948
01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:27.770
David Schaich (he): this is specifically known as be helpful.

949
01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:31.770
David Schaich (he): Pre. Or G.

950
01:28:34.150 --> 01:28:40.410
David Schaich (he): Yeah. A function of temperature is negative temperature, times.

951
01:28:40.710 --> 01:28:46.140
David Schaich (he): or the partition function, which itself is a function of the temperature.

952
01:28:48.250 --> 01:28:53.380
David Schaich (he): If we rearrange this to solve for the partition function, Z.

953
01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:58.010
David Schaich (he): Divide 3 by negative.

954
01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:03.200
David Schaich (he): That gives us just

955
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.560
David Schaich (he): the exponential of minus app

956
01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.570
David Schaich (he): over to you. So they

957
01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:21.550
David Schaich (he): contact expression for the partition function that has the implicit within it.

958
01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:28.130
David Schaich (he): That's just rearranging the definition.

959
01:29:28.190 --> 01:29:30.050
David Schaich (he): the helpful free energy.

960
01:29:30.490 --> 01:29:32.460
David Schaich (he): And we can also

961
01:29:33.090 --> 01:29:38.860
David Schaich (he): put this into microstate probability that gives distribution

962
01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:55.170
David Schaich (he): whatever that is. one, over the exponential of a negative number which is the exponential of a positive number. We just have the the free energy

963
01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:57.460
David Schaich (he): minus the microstate energy.

964
01:29:57.670 --> 01:30:00.700
David Schaich (he): all weighted by the fixed temperature

965
01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:02.510
David Schaich (he): and

966
01:30:03.650 --> 01:30:07.070
David Schaich (he): free energy is to some extent so

967
01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:18.310
David Schaich (he): okay terminology. But this is the gives an idea for the considerations that let's with the call that that's all.

968
01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:23.110
David Schaich (he): It combines with the energy of each individual microstates

969
01:30:23.130 --> 01:30:34.550
David Schaich (he): to determine the probability of that corresponding microstate. In particular, it has the same dimensions as energy and temperature in our units with

970
01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:38.550
David Schaich (he): energy and temperature, having

971
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:42.290
David Schaich (he): the same dimensions and same units.

972
01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:51.640
David Schaich (he): so the free energy is essentially what is left from the entropy has been

973
01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:58.090
David Schaich (he): maximized, which. so we can see from the signs in this relation, minimizes the

974
01:30:58.480 --> 01:30:59.690
David Schaich (he): free energy

975
01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:07.880
David Schaich (he): continuing on in this veins are actually

976
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:19.460
David Schaich (he): there's a little bit more use. We can get out of the I don't know it's free energy just by considering it so. Derivatives

977
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:38.690
David Schaich (he): to the derivatives of the help of free energy will turn out to be. We'll lean into the other. talking about

978
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:42.030
David Schaich (he): the average internal energy

979
01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:47.930
David Schaich (he): and the functions, except for sure.

980
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:58.050
David Schaich (he): So, hopping back to the expression we came up with just a few minutes ago with the internal energy. is

981
01:31:58.510 --> 01:32:01.380
David Schaich (he): the negative beta, derivative.

982
01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:04.090
David Schaich (he): The more of the partition function.

983
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:10.010
David Schaich (he): You write that here for it. Videos

984
01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.630
David Schaich (he): you can recognize that

985
01:32:21.190 --> 01:32:23.730
David Schaich (he): negative

986
01:32:24.030 --> 01:32:28.100
David Schaich (he): is the ratio of

987
01:32:28.110 --> 01:32:31.140
David Schaich (he): almost free energy to the temperature.

988
01:32:31.630 --> 01:32:42.800
David Schaich (he): This is derivative with respect to the inverse temperature of elements, free energy divided by the temperature. we can't convert into a

989
01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:44.990
David Schaich (he): temperature derivative

990
01:32:48.050 --> 01:32:59.300
David Schaich (he): just an over a factor of the derivative of the temperature itself with respect to his inverse. So with T being one over data, we can take the

991
01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:03.410
David Schaich (he): derivative of one over data our heads it's minus one

992
01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:05.480
David Schaich (he): over Beta squared.

993
01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:17.870
David Schaich (he): and of course, one over. Beta is just the temperature itself.

994
01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:23.140
David Schaich (he): So there is

995
01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:30.470
David Schaich (he): another illustration of how the partition function now in the form of the

996
01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:39.440
David Schaich (he): is the starting point to analyze and derive these quantities, like the average eternal energy.

997
01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:41.700
David Schaich (he): And similarly, for

998
01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:46.310
David Schaich (he): the entropy we consider just the

999
01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:50.110
David Schaich (he): temperature dependence of the free energy

1000
01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:51.410
David Schaich (he): by itself.

1001
01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:55.860
David Schaich (he): I'll pick up 2 terms.

1002
01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:58.020
David Schaich (he): problem.

1003
01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:04.220
David Schaich (he): first, the derivative of T. With respect to C, it's just one.

1004
01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:15.500
David Schaich (he): and then we have myst times. It's your derivative of the in itself.

1005
01:34:17.150 --> 01:34:22.100
David Schaich (he): and we just not finished for leading

1006
01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:27.470
David Schaich (he): a derivative of what set with respect to an inverse temperature, to the internal energy.

1007
01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:30.520
David Schaich (he): If we keep track of

1008
01:34:32.430 --> 01:34:35.910
David Schaich (he): negative signs and factors of T,

1009
01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:37.060
it's.

1010
01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:45.840
David Schaich (he): you can see in our heads with some care, or work it out explicitly from this line here is changing variables from Beta to T.

1011
01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:47.330
David Schaich (he): That

1012
01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:49.140
David Schaich (he): this derivative

1013
01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:58.910
David Schaich (he): is negative internal energy over the temperature. and

1014
01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:08.870
David Schaich (he): our first derivation of the entropy we found plus internal energy over temperature.

1015
01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:10.430
David Schaich (he): So this is

1016
01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:14.240
David Schaich (he): negative entropy. You would put it another way.

1017
01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:16.100
David Schaich (he): The

1018
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:30.220
David Schaich (he): is given by even simpler derivative of the free energy which we can also relates to the difference between

1019
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:33.830
David Schaich (he): the free energy, the average internal energy

1020
01:35:34.290 --> 01:35:37.980
David Schaich (he): weighted by the temperature just

1021
01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:43.200
David Schaich (he): inverting back from the water of the partition function to

1022
01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:52.890
David Schaich (he): the free energy divided by temperature. And that is actually a good place to stop for today

1023
01:35:54.270 --> 01:35:58.350
David Schaich (he): a couple minutes to one speaker, one out of time.

1024
01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:10.150
David Schaich (he): So this recap, because we went through a lot of the I wanted to make sure we got to the heat capacity, so that you had plenty of exposure to that. With

1025
01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:23.620
David Schaich (he): more than 8 we about to work on that homework assignment. We started off in the micro canonical ups of all, with a definition of the temperature of that looks fairly abstract as the response

1026
01:36:23.630 --> 01:36:35.830
David Schaich (he): of the entropy to a change in the energy with the fixed number of particles we saw that it's produced sensible behavior and the context of heat exchange

1027
01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:40.460
David Schaich (he): that agreed with our everyday intuition that energy should flow

1028
01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:51.420
David Schaich (he): for power to colder systems, bringing their temperatures closer together. and then based on the practicalities of actually carrying out physics, experiments.

1029
01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:55.330
David Schaich (he): observing the statistical systems that we're talking about.

1030
01:36:55.900 --> 01:37:01.420
David Schaich (he): I don't want to happen completely isolated from us. For the rest of the universe.

1031
01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:05.030
David Schaich (he): You want to be able to observe them and exchange energy with them.

1032
01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:08.250
David Schaich (he): so that led us to the canonical ensemble.

1033
01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:10.000
David Schaich (he): Hey?

1034
01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:14.410
David Schaich (he): Means of allowing the energy of a system to fluctuate

1035
01:37:14.490 --> 01:37:26.490
David Schaich (he): by exchange with its environment while fixing its temperature through thermal contact with a large external reservoir. It roughly, the trick showed us that the details of that

1036
01:37:26.770 --> 01:37:28.860
David Schaich (he): thermal reservoir, or

1037
01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:33.120
David Schaich (he): irrelevant to the chemical ensemble, and, in fact, unknowable

1038
01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:46.200
David Schaich (he): in the canonical approach. What we have is the Gibbs distribution and it's pulsing factor from which you have the partition function. It can derive

1039
01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:52.700
David Schaich (he): all of these interesting qualities, energy, entropy, and free energy, that we will

1040
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:58.140
David Schaich (he): begin playing with next week in top 3 applications.

1041
01:37:58.870 --> 01:38:04.990
David Schaich (he): So a busy day today. I'm: sure you're also busy with the computer project due tomorrow.

1042
01:38:05.190 --> 01:38:07.840
David Schaich (he): I'll let you get on with all of that

1043
01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:11.060
David Schaich (he): just checking the last time to see if there are

1044
01:38:11.230 --> 01:38:17.140
David Schaich (he): any questions about those assignments. or what we covered in the past couple of hours.

1045
01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:29.840
David Schaich (he): So good luck with that project that assignments and.
