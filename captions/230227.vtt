00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.590
David Schaich (he): Okay, welcome back to statistical physics on a Monday morning ---

2
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.820
David Schaich (he): the last Monday in February. So at least it's getting lighter every week. I think there are

3
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:23.200
David Schaich (he): more people online than in the room for a change. So I'll try to remember to keep an eye on the chat window, in case there are any questions.  I suppose

4
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.510
David Schaich (he): you're probably right now

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.210
David Schaich (he): busy dealing with the homework assignment, right on the heels of the computer project.

6
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.330
David Schaich (he): But the

7
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.650
David Schaich (he): positive aspect of that is that once you're through with that (due tomorrow), then you'll be free from assessment in this module

8
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.450
David Schaich (he): until after the spring break.  So that will be a

9
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.060
David Schaich (he): chance for you to relax, and me to catch up with the marking, which

10
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:59.240
David Schaich (he): I still need to --- already need to catch up on, since I have various other end-of-the-month deadlines to deal with.  But I hope not to

11
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.260
David Schaich (he): take too much longer with that. So before I forget

12
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.680
David Schaich (he): the 6-digit code for today is 6, 1, 1,

13
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.300
David Schaich (he): 8, 9, 4.  And

14
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.280
David Schaich (he): I should ask you if there are any questions about that homework assignment

15
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.610
David Schaich (he): or about what we covered last week.

16
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.340
David Schaich (he): I'll just briefly recap before

17
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.780
David Schaich (he): moving on to applications of the canonical

18
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.470
David Schaich (he): if you're in question

19
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.050
David Schaich (he): reminder, so that doesn't get lost on all those

20
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.240
David Schaich (he): assessments that last week we wrapped up the micro canonical.

21
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.000
David Schaich (he): On some let me start discussion of it.

22
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.060
David Schaich (he): I

23
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:18.100
David Schaich (he): defining the temperature in terms of how the entropy responds to a change in the energy. If a fixed number of particles. And we also refer to that

24
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.520
David Schaich (he): this definition of this.

25
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.430
David Schaich (he): that obvious to you, looked at it where it comes from it behaved sensibly. We consider heat exchange between

26
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.320
David Schaich (he): 2 different subsystems. The hotter system uses energy to the colder system.

27
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.280
David Schaich (he): and their temperatures approach each other.

28
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.860
David Schaich (he): I'm going to stand it

29
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.840
David Schaich (he): significantly More time on the

30
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.630
David Schaich (he): this week anymore. Next week, probably the week after that which.

31
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.600
David Schaich (he): in contrast to the micro

32
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.130
David Schaich (he): switch to

33
00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.880
David Schaich (he): the same

34
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.290
David Schaich (he): illustration, we had the micro canonical ensemble on the left, which

35
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:14.070
David Schaich (he): directly applies conservation of energy to our collection of end degrees of freedom itself. But this requires that those free to be

36
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.800
David Schaich (he): completely isolated

37
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.490
from the rest of the universe, unable to exchange

38
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.500
David Schaich (he): particle, number and or energy, E, which in practice is not very useful, because it provides

39
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:33.080
David Schaich (he): no way for anyone on the outside to look in and learn anything about what's going on inside that system.

40
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.500
David Schaich (he): So what is much more

41
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.380
David Schaich (he): useful is the so called the canonical ensemble.

42
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.480
David Schaich (he): which.

43
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:50.170
David Schaich (he): instead of directly conserving the energy, he said, fixes the temperature by allowing energy exchange with

44
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.530
David Schaich (he): some large external from a reservoir.

45
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.280
David Schaich (he): still fixing the number of particles in the system

46
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:04.810
David Schaich (he): and

47
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.140
David Schaich (he): the starting point for analyzing the

48
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.920
David Schaich (he): zoom back in.

49
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.160
David Schaich (he): as we will see several times

50
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.430
David Schaich (he): today as we go through applications of this.

51
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.040
David Schaich (he): I want to

52
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.980
David Schaich (he): begin each analysis by computing the so-called partition function

53
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.990
David Schaich (he): functions there that sums over all of the micro States.

54
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:03.720
David Schaich (he): exponential factors of the inverse temperature. Beta times, the energy of each microstate which I actually had it

55
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.100
David Schaich (he): written out next up above it.

56
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.780
David Schaich (he): the screen on the thing to consider for today. Equivalently we also defined

57
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.320
David Schaich (he): to help this free energy

58
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.710
David Schaich (he): that repackages the same information

59
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:35.490
David Schaich (he): with a logarithm that simplifies some relations. The biggest song. This collection of information about all of the microstates of the system

60
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:49.670
David Schaich (he): derive quantities. We will be interested in. including things like the average internal energy. She is no longer been served, but fluctuates around a well-defined.

61
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.790
David Schaich (he): The entropy remains important

62
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.420
David Schaich (he): derive quantity in the canonical ensemble just as it was in the micro canonical case.

63
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.090
David Schaich (he): and we also

64
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.140
David Schaich (he): to find the heat capacity.

65
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.390
David Schaich (he): The relation between temperature and energy

66
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:17.100
David Schaich (he): that in the homework you show is always non-negative and generally positive, so that

67
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:24.840
David Schaich (he): increasing the temperature that is fixed in our canonical approach increases that internal energy.

68
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:38.000
David Schaich (he): and the plan for today is applications of the canonical ensemble first to the physics of information looking at 2 different spin systems. So any questions about

69
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.800
David Schaich (he): that catch up before we move on.

70
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.150
David Schaich (he): So one that

71
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:15.990
David Schaich (he): remarkable aspect of statistical physics. That is very important to a lot of ongoing research that's in

72
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.060
David Schaich (he): quantum information science, and some of the names of black holes, things that we

73
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:27.360
David Schaich (he): can't get you in this module without quantum mechanics or general relativity, is the fact that

74
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.900
David Schaich (he): information itself is physical and

75
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.170
David Schaich (he): not only physical, but the foundational aspect of a lot of physical systems. To be

76
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.500
David Schaich (he): sure. information, common sense.

77
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.150
David Schaich (he): how they system

78
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.230
David Schaich (he): leads to physically observable effects.

79
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.650
David Schaich (he): We will now see an example of this

80
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.480
David Schaich (he): in the

81
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.450
David Schaich (he): in the context of the simple spin systems that we've introduced

82
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:18.200
David Schaich (he): already in the micro canonical ensemble. and we will

83
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.770
David Schaich (he): consider 2 different variations of

84
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:28.730
David Schaich (he): you spin systems depending on whether or not the degrees of freedom are

85
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:34.150
David Schaich (he): able to be distinguished from each other. So

86
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:42.990
David Schaich (he): we'll see how the spins in these systems can be either distinguishable or indistinguishable.

87
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.910
David Schaich (he): and this will have significant effects on

88
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:53.920
David Schaich (he): the derived quantities that we get from the canonical on sample based on this partition function

89
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.280
David Schaich (he): before diving into that.

90
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.570
David Schaich (he): I should probably emphasize that

91
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:10.510
David Schaich (he): we're really concerned with. When I say information, content is not the information that we or anyone else might have about any of these systems.

92
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.550
David Schaich (he): but

93
00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.500
David Schaich (he): really what is

94
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:19.550
David Schaich (he): know about them in principle it doesn't matter

95
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.380
David Schaich (he): whether or not anyone or anything actually knows

96
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:29.280
David Schaich (he): the information. But what can be known about a new system?

97
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:35.980
David Schaich (he): What information content it has. We will determine how it behaves physically.

98
00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.700
David Schaich (he): So.

99
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.920
David Schaich (he): to start with like more concrete example.

100
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.530
David Schaich (he): we can

101
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.820
David Schaich (he): make things distinguishable

102
00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.680
David Schaich (he): by say, fixing them

103
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.560
David Schaich (he): at

104
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.960
David Schaich (he): certain locations in

105
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.930
David Schaich (he): a solid material.

106
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.160
David Schaich (he): So the you

107
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:18.480
David Schaich (he): set up to have in mind is. we have our usual upward and down the pointing spins

108
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.060
David Schaich (he): just in a one-dimensional line.

109
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.830
David Schaich (he): and then we say that these are embedded

110
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.560
David Schaich (he): in some so

111
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:35.020
David Schaich (he): so lattice of spins the canonical approach. The number of spins in the temperature is fixed.

112
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:45.850
David Schaich (he): There is an external magnetic field strength. H. That in terms of the energy each of these spin configurations.

113
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.800
David Schaich (he): and because the spins are fixed at a no location.

114
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:57.830
David Schaich (he): and the observer can look at the corresponding location in that solid, and know which of these things

115
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.050
David Schaich (he): they are looking at.

116
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:10.390
David Schaich (he): so they can tell the parts whether this or spin is pointing up or down, and distinguish that from the third spin or the fifth spin

117
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:22.070
David Schaich (he): in a way that would not be possible. If, as we will see, the spins, work trees and move around each other, we will not be able to label them in that way.

118
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.200
David Schaich (he): So.

119
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:31.360
David Schaich (he): because we are able to distinguish all the of these spins, you have the

120
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.320
David Schaich (he): usual

121
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:40.030
David Schaich (he): system, or the usual accounting the same physics with the same mathematics.

122
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:45.410
David Schaich (he): possibly a coin. In times the number of microstates that we have

123
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.950
David Schaich (he): is to the power of N. There are 2 possible

124
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.530
David Schaich (he): orientations for each of the

125
00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.690
David Schaich (he): they all those microstates omega i.

126
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.110
David Schaich (he): An economical approach

127
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.250
David Schaich (he): microstate omega, i. Has energy, e. Sub. I.

128
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.850
David Schaich (he): The probability that depends

129
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.430
David Schaich (he): exponentially

130
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:23.380
David Schaich (he): on both that energy and

131
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.230
David Schaich (he): the fixed temperature of the system normalized by the partition function.

132
00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:38.060
David Schaich (he): and to make the mathematics that we want to go through a bit easier. and that

133
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:48.360
David Schaich (he): introduce some slightly more elegant notation. So, rather than talking about.

134
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.820
David Schaich (he): since they are up and down and plus and minus being the

135
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.870
David Schaich (he): total number of spins

136
00:12:56.030 --> 00:13:00.170
David Schaich (he): and label the spins that are parallel to the magnetic field.

137
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.510
David Schaich (he): just as

138
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.990
David Schaich (he): plus ones those that are anti parallel.

139
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.990
David Schaich (he): It's minus one.

140
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.280
David Schaich (he): and then

141
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.050
David Schaich (he): the energy takes

142
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:40.120
David Schaich (he): we simple form. There is a contribution of minus h. which upward one to the parallel spin

143
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.800
David Schaich (he): and contribution to plus h for each anti-parallel spin.

144
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.900
David Schaich (he): So going against the magnetic fields to it higher energy.

145
00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.490
David Schaich (he): So for the microstate omega I that is specified

146
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.300
David Schaich (he): bye

147
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:06.160
David Schaich (he): the you orientations of these and spins

148
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:13.730
David Schaich (he): s one through S. N. The energy is just minus h times the sum of these variables.

149
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.600
David Schaich (he): And as forecast, just to the start

150
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.990
David Schaich (he): of today's lecture, we will always begin these canonical analyses

151
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.390
David Schaich (he): with the partition function.

152
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.370
David Schaich (he): and then use that to derive

153
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:43.600
David Schaich (he): all of the quantities of interest. So the call partition function for distinguishable spins.

154
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.340
David Schaich (he): Zen. So d you for distinguishable.

155
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:55.040
David Schaich (he): This is the sum over all microstates Exponential You, said I.

156
00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:01.520
David Schaich (he): We have an expression for the energy as a sum over all of the spins.

157
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.650
David Schaich (he): and we said that the 2 N.

158
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:19.460
David Schaich (he): To the power in hospital microstates. some over all the possible orientations of all in of the skills. plus or minus one in our new notation.

159
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:25.010
David Schaich (he): And then the exponential of mine is paid at times energy.

160
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.570
David Schaich (he): It's Beta H.

161
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:35.030
David Schaich (he): Times that some over all the spins my very loss, and for those spins.

162
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:44.070
David Schaich (he): and I will save a bit of ank by defining it. A variable X, which is this combination.

163
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.740
David Schaich (he): A beta times H. The magnetic field in

164
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:56.430
David Schaich (he): units of the temperature. And we can notice that. And this simple system, or the spins. Don't interact with each other.

165
00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.400
David Schaich (he): This spin s One

166
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:06.680
David Schaich (he): can be pulled out through all of the other summations, so we break up this exponential of the product into it.

167
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:13.330
David Schaich (he): Sorry, the exponential of the song as a product and exponentials. Everything that depends on spin s one

168
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.080
David Schaich (he): be pulled out

169
00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.610
David Schaich (he): to the front.

170
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:26.660
David Schaich (he): Similarly for S. 2, S. 3, and so on to the final summation over

171
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.670
David Schaich (he): it should be capital, and

172
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.230
David Schaich (he): and then this is even

173
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:47.800
David Schaich (he): simpler, because each of these sums that is now being multiplied together are exactly the same.

174
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.610
David Schaich (he): We just have. and powers

175
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.420
David Schaich (he): of a single sum.

176
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.510
David Schaich (he): E to the power

177
00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.720
David Schaich (he): x times s. 3 to the nth power.

178
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.900
David Schaich (he): and there are only 2 terms in this sum. Where s is

179
00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:06.720
David Schaich (he): plus one in the x, or

180
00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:11.140
David Schaich (he): minus one. which we can recognize as

181
00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:15.589
David Schaich (he): twice the hyperbolic cosine of X, which is

182
00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:19.680
David Schaich (he): Beta H. All of that raised to the

183
00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:26.010
David Schaich (he): and power. And this sort of simplification in

184
00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:39.710
David Schaich (he): in an analysis of a system with a large number of degrees of freedom that ends up being just a single expression raised to a large power corresponding to all those degrees of freedom

185
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.720
David Schaich (he): is known as factorization.

186
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:51.660
David Schaich (he): This is just a brief assigned with a bit of terminology. It is something that we will see repeatedly

187
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:57.000
David Schaich (he): until we get to interacting systems, probably after the spring break.

188
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.450
David Schaich (he): and

189
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:05.560
David Schaich (he): it dramatically simplifies the mathematical treatment of these non interacting systems.

190
00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.430
David Schaich (he): All the particles

191
00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.770
David Schaich (he): just behave the same, and we end up with end powers of a single particle.

192
00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:16.820
David Schaich (he): In this case partition function can be helpful.

193
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.590
David Schaich (he): Free energy that corresponds

194
00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.530
David Schaich (he): to this partition function for n distinguishable spins

195
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.380
David Schaich (he): the fixed up at your team.

196
00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:40.700
David Schaich (he): We can recall from last week that the almost free energy

197
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:50.850
David Schaich (he): what's minus t times logarithm of the partition function. changing variables here to work in terms of that inverse temperature, Beta.

198
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.530
David Schaich (he): which is so terms that pack of tea

199
00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.140
David Schaich (he): into a factor of one over data.

200
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:04.410
David Schaich (he): and the logarithm brings the power down out front. We have

201
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:09.350
David Schaich (he): minus n times, the one out of the

202
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.150
David Schaich (he): all that over the inverse temperature data.

203
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:21.910
David Schaich (he): and this is all the setup that we need to compute things like

204
00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.780
David Schaich (he): the average internal energy

205
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.530
David Schaich (he): in the case of distinguishable spins. We saw last week that this was

206
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:37.170
David Schaich (he): minus temperature, squared you by the temperature of as comfortable as free energy divided by the temperature.

207
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:45.750
David Schaich (he): and I didn't write it explicitly, but should be easy enough to convince yourself that it's minus t squared D by a t

208
00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.920
David Schaich (he): is a. Derivative with respect to the inverse temperature beta

209
00:19:51.110 --> 00:20:02.050
David Schaich (he): of beta time staff which just cancels out that overall factor of one over data. and it comes minus and

210
00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.790
David Schaich (he): 2 calls

211
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:12.560
David Schaich (he): in the H,

212
00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:25.020
David Schaich (he): which is simpler than it might look at first. because the derivative of the law that brings his arguments down to the down there

213
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:40.290
David Schaich (he): and then the product rule takes the derivative of the argument of that long it should be derivative of a hyperbolic cosine is a hyperbolic sign

214
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.410
David Schaich (he): with that same factor of this 2,

215
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.710
David Schaich (he): and then finally, the argument of that

216
00:20:49.760 --> 00:21:03.030
David Schaich (he): hyperbolic cosine i'm. In another iteration of the chain rule to give a factor of H. So the 2 is cancel. and we end up with

217
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:08.440
David Schaich (he): minus N. Times H. Times

218
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:12.000
David Schaich (he): the ratio of cinch over to which is

219
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:18.310
David Schaich (he): hyperbolic engines. A Tch. a paper H.

220
00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.550
David Schaich (he): So we simple function for the internal energy

221
00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:29.420
David Schaich (he): coming from this factorized partition function. and the entropy

222
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.410
David Schaich (he): we saw last week is related to

223
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.210
David Schaich (he): the difference between the internal energy

224
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.690
David Schaich (he): and

225
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:49.180
David Schaich (he): the help of it's free energy. and it is. and just picking up

226
00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:56.060
David Schaich (he): the same sorts of behavior from each of these the

227
00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:01.710
David Schaich (he): N. Times H. Tang from the energy just pick up a factor of the inverse data.

228
00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.850
David Schaich (he): It cancels out

229
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:06.860
David Schaich (he): in the free energy.

230
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:11.390
David Schaich (he): It's 2 negative signs us with

231
00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.940
David Schaich (he): and more

232
00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:23.510
David Schaich (he): to cost data. H: So we have survived

233
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:32.760
David Schaich (he): the usual quantities that we're interested in, or a system of n distinguishable spin is embedded in a solid.

234
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.430
David Schaich (he): and

235
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.840
David Schaich (he): it's some insight into what these.

236
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:52.420
David Schaich (he): in some cases complicated mathematical expressions what they mean. I'll just buy it. calling them like, so

237
00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.650
David Schaich (he): probably can't it.

238
00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:01.730
David Schaich (he): Both expressions and plots on the screen at the same time.

239
00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:07.230
David Schaich (he): But maybe the easy thing to start off with is the

240
00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:12.060
David Schaich (he): energy. So that's the red line down here.

241
00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.120
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Normalized the energy vial

242
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:21.690
David Schaich (he): and the number of particles times. The external magnetic field to this line

243
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:23.550
David Schaich (he): is just

244
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.480
David Schaich (he): negative tch of

245
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.490
David Schaich (he): beta H,

246
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.330
David Schaich (he): which ends up, being

247
00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.510
David Schaich (he): the inverse of

248
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:46.560
David Schaich (he): the quantity on the horizontal axis. Here the temperature divided by the magnetic field or one over Beta H.

249
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:49.860
David Schaich (he): So we do that

250
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:54.380
David Schaich (he): as the temperature gets low that corresponds to

251
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:59.420
David Schaich (he): the inverse temperature, Beta going to infinity.

252
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:03.430
David Schaich (he): and the argument

253
00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:10.700
David Schaich (he): of the change itself is going to infinity.

254
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:16.260
David Schaich (he): and, as we can see, approaches minus one.

255
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.570
David Schaich (he): as the asymptotically low energy

256
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:21.590
David Schaich (he): limit.

257
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:24.310
David Schaich (he): and

258
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.430
David Schaich (he): it's actually let's see.

259
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.640
David Schaich (he): Go ahead here.

260
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:43.460
David Schaich (he): Low temperature limits. maybe going to infinity.

261
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:49.970
David Schaich (he): and H.

262
00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.210
David Schaich (he): Beta, h

263
00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.690
David Schaich (he): goes just to minus and H, which we can recognize as the

264
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.680
David Schaich (he): ground state energy.

265
00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.580
David Schaich (he): he not

266
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:11.800
David Schaich (he): from

267
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:16.540
David Schaich (he): our micro canonical analysis of spin systems

268
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:22.210
David Schaich (he): in the past few weeks. So this is what were you

269
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:28.700
David Schaich (he): could have expected just by physical arguments rather than going through mathematics. That

270
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.410
David Schaich (he): Hi! How are you?

271
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:36.570
David Schaich (he): Low energies? The ground state with the minimum energy is picked out.

272
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.750
David Schaich (he): thanks to the exponential suppression

273
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.520
David Schaich (he): of any microstates with

274
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.060
David Schaich (he): higher energies

275
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.520
David Schaich (he): from this gives distribution

276
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.720
that it contains.

277
00:25:53.280 --> 00:26:00.510
David Schaich (he): And we can also. from that same sort of physical argument as well as from the mathematics.

278
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:08.920
David Schaich (he): I appreciate why the entropy itself goes to 0 in that low temperature limit.

279
00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:12.040
David Schaich (he): There we end up with

280
00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:18.550
David Schaich (he): really only that single micro state, corresponding to all the spins align with the magnetic field

281
00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.640
David Schaich (he): that completely determines the energy

282
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.220
David Schaich (he): in that 0 temperature limits.

283
00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.870
David Schaich (he): as well as all other properties of the system

284
00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:35.390
David Schaich (he): so physically. as we approach

285
00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.950
David Schaich (he): so called absolute 0,

286
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:54.730
David Schaich (he): we are ending up with it just a single micro state corresponding to that ground state.

287
00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.540
David Schaich (he): And you're calling that the

288
00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:02.800
David Schaich (he): entropy micro

289
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:05.580
David Schaich (he): the logarithm of the number of microstates

290
00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:15.700
David Schaich (he): that single microstate, one just gives 0 entropy. which we can also

291
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:19.820
David Schaich (he): confirm mathematically from this expression.

292
00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.750
David Schaich (he): It's fine.

293
00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:26.650
David Schaich (he): noting that as Beta goes to in Trinity, it's like

294
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:38.930
David Schaich (he): is to you some of the beta h plus e to the minus beta h e to the minus infinity goes to 0. So this just becomes the Lord

295
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:46.450
David Schaich (he): up into the Beta ancient that limit which is the to h itself. and the entropy

296
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.000
David Schaich (he): sd goes to

297
00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.470
David Schaich (he): I just in Beta H.

298
00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.090
David Schaich (he): I'm the tch goes to one

299
00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.020
David Schaich (he): at low energies

300
00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.370
David Schaich (he): plus and

301
00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:07.950
David Schaich (he): data in from the logarithm of a hyperbolic cosine term. Those 2 terms cancel off and give us 0.

302
00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:22.180
David Schaich (he): What is perhaps more interesting than the asymptotic limit at

303
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:28.360
David Schaich (he): vanishingly small temperature, absolute 0 and Beta going to infinity

304
00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.430
David Schaich (he): use.

305
00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:35.110
David Schaich (he): How do these functions approach that limit when the temperature is

306
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.560
David Schaich (he): small? But non-zero

307
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.540
David Schaich (he): so is it going to be that it's large. You see there's some interesting curvature

308
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.220
David Schaich (he): going on in these 2 functions which we can

309
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.640
David Schaich (he): get some insight into by expanding

310
00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:57.370
David Schaich (he): our results. In the case of low temperatures.

311
00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.220
David Schaich (he): and this will be

312
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:11.330
David Schaich (he): okay

313
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:21.390
David Schaich (he): relevant for the second homework assignments. It will be some work for you to do exploring this sort of thing on there.

314
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:25.680
David Schaich (he): but at the moment it's also going to be physically revealing.

315
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:34.320
David Schaich (he): because what we will see is that when the temperature is low, but not 0. You will

316
00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:38.380
David Schaich (he): have contributions from

317
00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:44.480
David Schaich (he): the higher energy micro states

318
00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.180
David Schaich (he): which have

319
00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:03.920
David Schaich (he): energy e sub. I. Larger than the ground State energy exactly sometimes called excited states.

320
00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.900
David Schaich (he): and we can expect them to be exponentially

321
00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:14.170
David Schaich (he): suppressed.

322
00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.420
David Schaich (he): Bye. the corresponding probabilities.

323
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:28.200
David Schaich (he): Boltzmann factor, the exponential of minus

324
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:29.960
David Schaich (he): E. Of I. Over T.

325
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.870
David Schaich (he): Where there's a complication that

326
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:46.940
David Schaich (he): each excitement, state, energy, clinical response to many distinct microstates. Again depending on the information content of the system

327
00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.840
David Schaich (he): in the case of spin systems.

328
00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:52.650
David Schaich (he): Yes.

329
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:55.960
David Schaich (he): excited states and higher energy

330
00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.650
David Schaich (he): levels can be organized in

331
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.710
David Schaich (he): a useful way.

332
00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:17.750
David Schaich (he): You see that all these excited states fall into the discrete pattern of energy levels. they all separated by the constant shift with the energy

333
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.910
David Schaich (he): more what it's called Energy Gap

334
00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:35.320
David Schaich (he): to zoom out to get that the whole page on the screen here. So this energy gap the delta, the between neighboring

335
00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:40.100
David Schaich (he): energy levels in the spin system. So in the case where we have

336
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:46.790
David Schaich (he): n minus plus one gather recording spins that are online against the magnetic field

337
00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:53.300
David Schaich (he): compared to in case of just and minus spins aligned against the magnetic field.

338
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:57.950
David Schaich (he): Oh. we've seen that the

339
00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.270
David Schaich (he): energy

340
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:02.270
David Schaich (he): is

341
00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.580
David Schaich (he): minus h times

342
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:20.610
David Schaich (he): 2 n plus minus n. Every increase in and minus is a decrease in n plus. so that negative one factor for and plus

343
00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:28.030
David Schaich (he): coming in with 2 times. Nh. Means that factor with 2 H.

344
00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:33.260
David Schaich (he): With everything else cancelling out between those 2 energy levels.

345
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:38.940
David Schaich (he): So this is the energy gap between energy levels for

346
00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.700
David Schaich (he): any spin system. And it is this. yeah, that

347
00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:51.460
David Schaich (he): real control. The corrections are the approach to

348
00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.290
David Schaich (he): 0 temperature limits.

349
00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:05.430
David Schaich (he): I should say 0 temperature limits for each of the quantities that we are interested in.

350
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.090
David Schaich (he): So if we look at

351
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:27.850
David Schaich (he): the average internal energy normalized by the number of particles and the external field. which is just this hypnotic tangent of Beta H.

352
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.670
David Schaich (he): That's fine. Here

353
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.980
David Schaich (he): I want to expand this at

354
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.410
David Schaich (he): low temperatures. but not 0.

355
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:48.180
David Schaich (he): So that is It's Beta H. Much larger than what?

356
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:52.410
David Schaich (he): This is not the natural regime for

357
00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:56.740
David Schaich (he): a serious expansion of the hyperbolic engine may remember that

358
00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:01.210
David Schaich (he): the series for the ever got like tangent with small Beta H. It's just

359
00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:05.340
David Schaich (he): x. The arguments plus x cubed over 3,

360
00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:10.870
David Schaich (he): and so on. But that's

361
00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:15.090
David Schaich (he): the opposite limit of high temperatures. Beta age, much less than one.

362
00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:18.670
David Schaich (he): Consider that in due course put it into

363
00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:23.380
David Schaich (he): Expand this hyperbolic tangent. We really need to go back to

364
00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:26.840
David Schaich (he): it's definition under the hood

365
00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:29.530
David Schaich (he): as a ratio of

366
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:43.550
David Schaich (he): hyperbolic signs and cosines. What if we cancel out over all factors of the plus beta? H. We have this ratio of that I call it

367
00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:45.090
David Schaich (he): looks familiar.

368
00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.130
David Schaich (he): and

369
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:52.750
David Schaich (he): because Beta H. Is much larger than one, these exponential factors.

370
00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:59.310
David Schaich (he): e to the minus 2 beta H. All right. exponentially suppressed compared to one.

371
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:01.950
David Schaich (he): and we can expand

372
00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:10.100
David Schaich (he): the one over one plus x

373
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:14.130
David Schaich (he): or X's. This exponential factor as

374
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.730
David Schaich (he): the geometric series.

375
00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:22.350
It's one minus

376
00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:28.400
David Schaich (he): x minus 2 beta h plus order x squared

377
00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:32.700
David Schaich (he): for me to h

378
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:34.770
David Schaich (he): and

379
00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:41.790
David Schaich (he): all that. This is as a reminder of It's been a while since you've done serious expansions.

380
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:48.960
David Schaich (he): Geometric series, one over one minus X is the some

381
00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.890
David Schaich (he): K equals 0 to infinity

382
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.680
David Schaich (he): of the to the power, hey?

383
00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:58.670
David Schaich (he): So long as

384
00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:07.680
David Schaich (he): X's. Well, the radius of convergence goes all the way out to it does not include x equals one. In this case we have.

385
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:11.890
David Schaich (he): if every small value of X E to the minus 2, so that we can.

386
00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:17.530
David Schaich (he): Okay, this series after the first non-trivial term K: One

387
00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:19.540
David Schaich (he): and just leave the rest of it as

388
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:26.760
David Schaich (he): some collection of terms, the largest of which is

389
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.390
David Schaich (he): this E. To the minus 4 theta H.

390
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.760
David Schaich (he): So, multiplying out these 2 factors.

391
00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:43.680
David Schaich (he): we end up with first the overall minus one. then 2 factors of

392
00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:50.390
David Schaich (he): minus E to the minus 2 Beta H, into which come with a negative sign that cancels the one out front.

393
00:36:51.640 --> 00:37:00.210
David Schaich (he): so 2 e to the minus 2, Beta H. And then we can just ignore everything higher.

394
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.340
David Schaich (he): Small corrections in the high temperature regime.

395
00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:17.650
David Schaich (he): and as advertised. you can recognize the energy gap delta e equals 2 page in this expression. Minus one is the

396
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.740
David Schaich (he): limit of the energy.

397
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:29.510
David Schaich (he): As the temperature goes to absolute 0. And then there is the exponentially suppressed correction. and

398
00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:35.640
David Schaich (he): 2 H delta E with the negative sign over temperature, one over beta.

399
00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:40.160
David Schaich (he): plus the order of the exponential of

400
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:44.060
David Schaich (he): twice that under she normalized by the temperature

401
00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.230
David Schaich (he): services.

402
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.010
David Schaich (he): the expected exponential suppression

403
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:56.130
David Schaich (he): i'm excited to see it effects at

404
00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.940
David Schaich (he): low temperatures

405
00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:06.950
David Schaich (he): which we argued.

406
00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.760
David Schaich (he): we we should expect, based on the form

407
00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:19.150
David Schaich (he): of the Boltzmann factor in the economical. One side of the probabilities are proportional to the exponential would be to the

408
00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:34.100
David Schaich (he): the exponential of minus energy over temperature. See ratio of the probability for having and minus one spins. Why? Because the magnetic field

409
00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.350
David Schaich (he): in this ratio of probabilities. The

410
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:44.830
David Schaich (he): partition function cancels off. This is out. We just have that

411
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:48.040
David Schaich (he): e to the N minus one

412
00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.560
David Schaich (he): over t.

413
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:56.670
David Schaich (he): which is e to the

414
00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.020
David Schaich (he): minus state of times, the energy gap.

415
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:05.110
David Schaich (he): and just looking at

416
00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:07.710
David Schaich (he): the form of the plot.

417
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:16.310
David Schaich (he): she just barely fits on the same screen with the mathematical expression you derive.

418
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:21.390
David Schaich (he): We can appreciate that the slow temperatures or

419
00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:24.090
David Schaich (he): showing

420
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:34.970
David Schaich (he): this exponential. exponentially rapid approach 2 0 temperature, limited minus one. So that's in this region, where.

421
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:42.400
David Schaich (he): as the temperature goes to 0. We get very close to minus one exponentially quickly. But Don't quite

422
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:48.880
David Schaich (he): get all the way there until the end temperature reaches absolute 0,

423
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:58.510
David Schaich (he): we can do It's similar low temperature expression for. or the temperature, expansion, or the entropy

424
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:05.770
David Schaich (he): so

425
00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:10.360
David Schaich (he): mobilizing that by the constant factor of N.

426
00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.820
David Schaich (he): That was present in both of these terms

427
00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:17.920
David Schaich (he): that we computed always.

428
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.640
David Schaich (he): there's the actual

429
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.730
David Schaich (he): expression. So pulling up the overall end, we have 2 terms

430
00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:27.290
David Schaich (he): for the entropy.

431
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:32.330
David Schaich (he): Yeah. minus Beta H.

432
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.740
David Schaich (he): Times, the hyperbolic tangents of Beta Age.

433
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:38.870
David Schaich (he): which is

434
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:42.220
David Schaich (he): just

435
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:45.950
David Schaich (he): the constant factor Times

436
00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:50.400
David Schaich (he): the form of the energy that we expanded up here.

437
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:59.860
David Schaich (he): So that's and we F. C is minus one plus 2 e to the minus

438
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:02.430
David Schaich (he): plus order

439
00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:11.750
David Schaich (he): e to the minus 2. The delta e. The other term was just pointing out that end

440
00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:14.850
David Schaich (he): log

441
00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:18.210
David Schaich (he): of twice the hyperbolic.

442
00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.170
David Schaich (he): I'm: a.

443
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.880
David Schaich (he): which is worth dealing with

444
00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.500
David Schaich (he): separately. So

445
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:39.880
David Schaich (he): going back to yeah definition of these hyper trigonometric functions.

446
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:47.750
David Schaich (he): Yeah, inside the logarithm, E to the x plus e to the minus x for x is beta h

447
00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:51.560
David Schaich (he): can pull out that you know the Beta H factor.

448
00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:03.660
David Schaich (he): and then use the properties of the logarithm to break up the log of the product into

449
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.000
David Schaich (he): some of laws.

450
00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:13.040
David Schaich (he): So the is just the argument, beta h

451
00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:20.320
David Schaich (he): one plus e to the minus 2 beta age.

452
00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:32.800
David Schaich (he): This exponential factor is our very small expansion parameter. and we hopefully familiar to the log of one, let's say, a small number

453
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:44.130
David Schaich (he): is just that small number itself E to the minus 2 beta age again, plus

454
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:48.500
David Schaich (he): corrections of that small number, square cube, and so on.

455
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:49.970
David Schaich (he): So you

456
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.470
David Schaich (he): terms we can neglect, Begin with the

457
00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:57.320
David Schaich (he): for me to h the exponential factor squared.

458
00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:00.640
David Schaich (he): So.

459
00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:08.120
David Schaich (he): adding these 2 terms together.

460
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:12.860
David Schaich (he): you can see that the

461
00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:25.940
David Schaich (he): minus Beta H from the first term, that minus one times, beta h or cancel off, we plus we at the second term.

462
00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.590
David Schaich (he): and then that leaves

463
00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:34.300
David Schaich (he): 2 terms that

464
00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:42.780
David Schaich (he): depend on E to the minus 2 beta age, which is e to the minus beta times the energy gap delta e.

465
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:49.160
David Schaich (he): The first of these has. hey? 2 times.

466
00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:56.390
David Schaich (he): I should say the negative sign here is that same negative sign up front.

467
00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:01.470
David Schaich (he): So i'm going very quickly with those

468
00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:06.070
David Schaich (he): hopefully. you're able to convince yourself that the signs are coming out

469
00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:08.940
David Schaich (he): correctly.

470
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:13.050
David Schaich (he): So we have 2 Beta h, which is beta times the energy gap.

471
00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:15.450
David Schaich (he): almost each of the

472
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:20.080
David Schaich (he): minus beta delta e. and then plus

473
00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.340
David Schaich (he): this term here you to the minus.

474
00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.480
David Schaich (he): and then order

475
00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:31.300
David Schaich (he): Oh.

476
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:42.660
David Schaich (he): the exponential of twice that energy gap divided by the temperature. So even though so, it's a slightly different behavior than the

477
00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:49.600
David Schaich (he): no energy corrections to the energy you just have that single exponential factor. You'll be having

478
00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:56.420
David Schaich (he): 2 exponential factors, one of which is multiplied by a large number data.

479
00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:00.850
David Schaich (he): I see a constant energy gap. It's much larger than one.

480
00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:07.290
David Schaich (he): but even that large factor is still overwhelmed by this exponential suppression

481
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.300
David Schaich (he): in the behavior that we're plotting here.

482
00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:16.900
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Approach of the entropy in blue to its low energy limits

483
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:22.660
David Schaich (he): looks just as rapid as the approach of the energy.

484
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:26.580
David Schaich (he): Despite this large factor of

485
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:30.240
David Schaich (he): Beta that is, in front of the meeting term.

486
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.950
David Schaich (he): so many questions about. I did the physics that

487
00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:43.550
David Schaich (he): it's

488
00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.650
David Schaich (he): mathematics that we've done to

489
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:50.870
David Schaich (he): expand the energy and entropy at those temperatures.

490
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:54.840
David Schaich (he): and see the concrete form.

491
00:45:55.040 --> 00:46:00.430
David Schaich (he): how the energy gap is controlling the approach to absolute 0.

492
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.460
David Schaich (he): I'm not seeing. Anyhow.

493
00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:22.370
David Schaich (he): it's just about time or break to

494
00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:26.920
David Schaich (he): I can, either. From all of these manipulations i'll just

495
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:28.790
David Schaich (he): forecast to that.

496
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:34.620
David Schaich (he): Once we get back from that break at 10,

497
00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:38.190
David Schaich (he): well look at the opposite limit.

498
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:44.450
David Schaich (he): I'll see you

499
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:54.650
David Schaich (he): derive qualities for distinguishable spins in the canonical ensemble. looking at the limit of high temperature.

500
00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:00.310
David Schaich (he): It's going to 0,

501
00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:03.420
David Schaich (he): as we know the

502
00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:08.990
David Schaich (he): and we all like tangents of at a large number

503
00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:19.970
David Schaich (he): is going to 0, so it's steadily approaching at 0. We will see that the entropy, by contrast

504
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.090
David Schaich (he): approaches a

505
00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:26.040
David Schaich (he): non-zero. By that constant

506
00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:33.430
David Schaich (he): I was already given here we'll derive that. Let me come back after the break, then

507
00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:41.890
David Schaich (he): turn to the case of indisputable spins, and see how things differ depending on their information.

508
00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:46.000
David Schaich (he): So i'll pause the recording that you

509
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:54.070
David Schaich (he): get a bit refreshed, and then come back at 10 to pick up with the remainder of this

510
00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.380
David Schaich (he): physics of information calculation.

511
00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:07.120
David Schaich (he): not seeing any questions. No, I

512
00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:14.570
David Schaich (he): quickly wrap up this analysis and distinguishable spin systems, and the canonical ensemble

513
00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.830
David Schaich (he): a high temperature. Expansion for

514
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:21.390
David Schaich (he): energy is

515
00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:31.830
David Schaich (he): simpler than the lower temperature case. because now arguments on the side of all the tangent is

516
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:36.030
David Schaich (he): the small expansion Parameter X,

517
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:39.460
David Schaich (he): much less than one that we

518
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:45.650
David Schaich (he): have to deal with high temperature limit where the inverse temperature beta is going to 0.

519
00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:46.820
David Schaich (he): It's the

520
00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.700
David Schaich (he): fixed strength. H of the

521
00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.480
David Schaich (he): external related feel. as I mentioned earlier.

522
00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:54.470
Yeah.

523
00:48:54.500 --> 00:49:00.480
David Schaich (he): Usual serious expansion for the hyperbolic tangent. Very small value of X is

524
00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:04.170
David Schaich (he): X itself. plus one third

525
00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:09.230
David Schaich (he): or minus one through X queue to rather with the negative sign that

526
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:15.280
David Schaich (he): cancels out, and then higher order terms that

527
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:32.420
David Schaich (he): I mean it over the right Beta H to the fifth. We can neglect in this little bit of high temperatures. so as bet it goes to 0. This is going to 0 as forecast

528
00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:43.400
David Schaich (he): that's great infinite temperature limit of this system. and we can also see that the approach to 0

529
00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.940
David Schaich (he): here is

530
00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.910
David Schaich (he): linear in Beta H. Or

531
00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:57.650
David Schaich (he): one over X, as opposed to the exponential approach to the low temperature limit. So in agreement with this plot, here

532
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:07.680
David Schaich (he): much slower, approach polynomial in one over

533
00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:09.180
David Schaich (he): Beta H.

534
00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:13.650
David Schaich (he): As opposed to the exponential approach to the low temperature limits.

535
00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:18.900
David Schaich (he): And one other thing we can recognize in this result.

536
00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:24.140
David Schaich (he): This is temperature going to infinity.

537
00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.530
David Schaich (he): I put out a supplemental

538
00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:36.150
David Schaich (he): pencast last week, looking at the temperature of the micro canonical spin system which I should have mentioned when doing the recap

539
00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.160
David Schaich (he): an hour ago. But there you saw

540
00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.250
David Schaich (he): that in the micro canonical case.

541
00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:47.930
David Schaich (he): do you

542
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.260
David Schaich (he): temperature for a spin system of this sort?

543
00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:58.650
David Schaich (he): Actually. I First, the temperature went to infinity as the conserved

544
00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:02.970
David Schaich (he): energy went was set to

545
00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:08.330
David Schaich (he): 0. So what we're seeing here. and this expansion is

546
00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:17.900
David Schaich (he): same behavior from a different perspective where the temperature is fixed, and as we take it large, the internal energy

547
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:19.470
David Schaich (he): goes to 0.

548
00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:26.940
David Schaich (he): Similarly for the entropy

549
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:38.180
David Schaich (he): as before, we have I this Beta H. Times hyperbolic tensions

550
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.230
David Schaich (he): a beta h plus.

551
00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:50.430
David Schaich (he): So

552
00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.320
David Schaich (he): this whole first term here

553
00:51:56.770 --> 00:51:57.920
David Schaich (he): talking in the

554
00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:04.860
David Schaich (he): hyperbolic tangents expansion. There we we pick up a plus.

555
00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:16.360
David Schaich (he): It's a one factor of the age from the expansion. The negative sign

556
00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:30.540
David Schaich (he): is the same in both cases. and then the higher order terms will start coming in now at data Hqs times that age. So David

557
00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:33.510
David Schaich (he): the Fourth. each to the fourth.

558
00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:36.430
David Schaich (he): Over here.

559
00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:39.150
David Schaich (he): logarithm, let's say

560
00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:51.490
David Schaich (he): different expansion. To consider it. What we can do is break up the product into a sum of

561
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:56.370
David Schaich (he): plus

562
00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:01.540
David Schaich (he): hyperbolic cosine of a small number

563
00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:08.090
David Schaich (he): has another serious expansion in there that we hyperbola tangents. First term is one.

564
00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:09.450
David Schaich (he): Let me pick up

565
00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.440
David Schaich (he): one over 2 x squared or X's

566
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:15.330
David Schaich (he): the age. then order

567
00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.090
David Schaich (he): X to the

568
00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:18.250
David Schaich (he): fourth

569
00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:22.880
David Schaich (he): inside the Lord. Yes.

570
00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:27.230
David Schaich (he): the Beta H is now our small parameter.

571
00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:29.840
David Schaich (he): so the log of 1, 6 small number

572
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:32.880
David Schaich (he): is just that

573
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:36.620
David Schaich (he): small number one half Beta h squared.

574
00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:38.900
David Schaich (he): What's the order

575
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:42.330
David Schaich (he): to the fourth?

576
00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:55.540
David Schaich (he): So, bringing everything together. we have this constant one of 2, the and minus one half

577
00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:02.420
David Schaich (he): a h from the combination of those 2 terms, and minus one plus a half.

578
00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:05.040
David Schaich (he): and then

579
00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:13.890
David Schaich (he): an infinite series of higher order corrections that come in with a leading term of beta interested in power. For

580
00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:16.650
David Schaich (he): so this is

581
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:29.650
David Schaich (he): consistent with what we have. But here the Scottish line that the entropy approaches at high temperatures. He is just the logarithm of 2,

582
00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:31.840
David Schaich (he): and

583
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:39.450
David Schaich (he): there is a somewhat more rapid approach going like one over X squared rather than one over X in the energy.

584
00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:40.940
David Schaich (he): but still much

585
00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:45.820
David Schaich (he): the more gradual, of the exponential conversions to the low temperature limits.

586
00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:50.610
David Schaich (he): Something else that is also north. Noting

587
00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.700
David Schaich (he): is that in that high temperature limits

588
00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:00.850
David Schaich (he): the entropy itself

589
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:06.670
David Schaich (he): approaches N. Times log, 2 multiplying through my end.

590
00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.050
David Schaich (he): I should see

591
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:22.020
David Schaich (he): one to the end, which. starting off by you this thing with the long rhythm of the number of microstates. and this relation between the entropy and the logarithm of the number of microstates.

592
00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:25.750
David Schaich (he): It was what we derived

593
00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.540
David Schaich (he): for the micro canonical ensemble.

594
00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:36.400
David Schaich (he): It does not hold in general for the economic ensemble, but we see we recovered it

595
00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:37.500
David Schaich (he): from

596
00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:41.380
David Schaich (he): more complicated than mathematics in this high temperature limits

597
00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:52.330
David Schaich (he): to that is. as to is going to infinity. We essentially recover the micro canonic

598
00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:57.820
David Schaich (he): from the economical case. and this can be appreciated by

599
00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:05.600
David Schaich (he): we're calling the form of the microstate probabilities that depend on

600
00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:08.010
David Schaich (he): the energy. So all of those

601
00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:14.080
David Schaich (he): probabilities. the exponential of minus

602
00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:21.310
David Schaich (he): e. I. Over t as t goes to infinity. The argument of the exponential.

603
00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:33.200
David Schaich (he): all right. goes to 0. The exponential itself is approximately one. So every probability is approximately that constant factor. Oh.

604
00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:38.660
David Schaich (he): what over the partition function which itself is just the sum

605
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:44.380
David Schaich (he): over all microstates of

606
00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:48.360
David Schaich (he): these exponential factors that vanishes high temperatures.

607
00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:51.850
David Schaich (he): So in that limits, and only in that limit.

608
00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:56.710
David Schaich (he): that some is just counting one M. Times for each of the m

609
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:58.040
David Schaich (he): microstates.

610
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:00.840
David Schaich (he): So

611
00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:05.710
David Schaich (he): we have a connection between this canonical

612
00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:18.610
David Schaich (he): analysis and what we have the before or the microcanonic. In this regime, where the high temperature is essentially

613
00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:26.730
David Schaich (he): eradicating, all of the differences between the different microstates that have different internal energies

614
00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:31.970
David Schaich (he): and all small compared to the

615
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.150
David Schaich (he): Now, the question is.

616
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:41.020
David Schaich (he): what to do. but the

617
00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:46.770
David Schaich (he): other analysis that we have to look at. We've been considering

618
00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:53.620
David Schaich (he): your distinguishable spins embedded in a solid at a particular location. That's the subscript D.

619
00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:57.370
David Schaich (he): And all of these results, for the energy; and

620
00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.220
David Schaich (he): if we think about

621
00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:07.440
David Schaich (he): schemes. instead of being embedded in a cellular.

622
00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:11.630
David Schaich (he): they are allowed to move freely

623
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:13.300
David Schaich (he): as a gas.

624
00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:20.230
David Schaich (he): then they become

625
00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.190
David Schaich (he): indistinguishable, and we'll still consider

626
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:28.870
David Schaich (he): a one dimensional case for simplicity. We have

627
00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:33.240
David Schaich (he): see the same spins as before

628
00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:36.250
David Schaich (he): any line there are

629
00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:39.240
David Schaich (he): any of them fixed temperature team

630
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:45.200
David Schaich (he): approach in this external magnetic field. H.

631
00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:56.620
David Schaich (he): The differences with the spins being allowed to freely move past each other. We can't

632
00:58:56.860 --> 00:59:00.680
David Schaich (he): saying anything like the 4 point is down, and the third one is all

633
00:59:00.830 --> 00:59:01.830
David Schaich (he): because

634
00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:09.180
David Schaich (he): the even though I've drawn a snapshot of the system Here, as the spins move, they can rearrange.

635
00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.020
David Schaich (he): and

636
00:59:10.070 --> 00:59:16.330
David Schaich (he): we lose track of any labels that we give them like third spin or fourth spend

637
00:59:16.790 --> 00:59:18.300
David Schaich (he): There's no way to

638
00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:21.600
David Schaich (he): pick out a particular spin.

639
00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:26.770
David Schaich (he): So if we consider just

640
00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:30.520
David Schaich (he): the simplest example of

641
00:59:32.350 --> 00:59:36.670
David Schaich (he): a 2 spin system in this gas. Then

642
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:43.610
David Schaich (he): think about all the possible microstates that we can have.

643
00:59:46.890 --> 00:59:51.160
David Schaich (he): This is similar to a very small system that we used for the

644
00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:57.740
David Schaich (he): replica trick when introducing the canonic what we had

645
01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.680
David Schaich (he): 4 possible microstates, with

646
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:13.580
David Schaich (he): all values of spends being up or down. But if the spins are indistinguishable. then

647
01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:20.080
David Schaich (he): what I've drawn here with this thing on the left being up in the spin on the right being down

648
01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.350
David Schaich (he): cannot be distinguished

649
01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.410
David Schaich (he): from the skin on the left being down, it's been on the right being

650
01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:37.980
David Schaich (he): so. This is all. Just a single microstate, which we can leave it as microstate 3 compared to microstates. one and 2.

651
01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:44.670
David Schaich (he): So these 2 spins are producing

652
01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:50.790
David Schaich (he): you totally, only 3 microstates.

653
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:57.450
David Schaich (he): not to be to the end that we had in the distinguishable case.

654
01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:02.760
David Schaich (he): And this is the difference in the pure information coming in between

655
01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:08.550
David Schaich (he): these 2 types of systems. There's a different number of microstates that we have the information

656
01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:09.890
David Schaich (he): to specify.

657
01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:13.920
David Schaich (he): depending on the distinguishability of the

658
01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:16.760
David Schaich (he): so generalizing to the

659
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:21.460
David Schaich (he): an arbitrary number of

660
01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:29.480
David Schaich (he): in principle. It is only possible to No. The

661
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:35.700
David Schaich (he): total number of spins that are

662
01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.400
David Schaich (he): we take up. We're pointing down

663
01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:40.530
David Schaich (he): for each, my prostate.

664
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:45.330
David Schaich (he): We can't know which

665
01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:50.940
David Schaich (he): of the spins are the ones that are pointing up, and which other one is pointing down. We don't have access to

666
01:01:51.010 --> 01:01:53.120
David Schaich (he): that information with that legal.

667
01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:58.880
David Schaich (he): and of course the number of up and down

668
01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:04.510
David Schaich (he): uniquely determines the energy that we've been labeling by.

669
01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:10.030
David Schaich (he): You saw that, and minus the number of skins in each direction.

670
01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:14.840
David Schaich (he): So in this case of indistinguishable spins in a gas

671
01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:18.530
David Schaich (he): instead of to the end that microstates

672
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.940
David Schaich (he): you pick up just one microstates

673
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.620
David Schaich (he): for each energy level.

674
01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:44.240
David Schaich (he): So, just as a quick example to

675
01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:48.620
David Schaich (he): make sure this is clear. Okay.

676
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:55.650
David Schaich (he): look at a slightly larger number of spins. So systems is for spins.

677
01:02:58.870 --> 01:03:04.840
David Schaich (he): How many microstates are we going to have in this case.

678
01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:33.320
David Schaich (he): This is a small enough number of spins that we can just label the whole set of micro space exhaustively.

679
01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.400
David Schaich (he): They're given by the energy. We know that the

680
01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:39.590
David Schaich (he): ground state energy is

681
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:49.090
David Schaich (he): e equal minus. Nh. In this case it is 4, and then the energy gap is 2 times. H: so the

682
01:03:49.560 --> 01:04:02.890
David Schaich (he): first exciting stage. a higher energy. You want to another 2 h to 0, and so on until we get up to into the plus nh.

683
01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:18.080
David Schaich (he): So this minus 4 and h corresponds to all the spins pointing Oh, along with magnetic field. Either the plus 4 age is all over, spends pointing down

684
01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:21.740
David Schaich (he): a line against or opposite to the magnetic field.

685
01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:27.880
David Schaich (he): and the intermediate energies have mixtures of spins pointing upward down. so

686
01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:36.360
David Schaich (he): 2 up and 2 down for the case of 0 energy. But we can't tell which 2 or of all which 2 are down. We just have that single microstate

687
01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:45.410
David Schaich (he): with energy 0. So 5 microstates for N equals 4 generalizes to n plus one

688
01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:51.470
David Schaich (he): microstates; for in general

689
01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:54.470
David Schaich (he): system, within degrees of freedom.

690
01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:02.140
David Schaich (he): what we can do

691
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.010
David Schaich (he): given

692
01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.980
David Schaich (he): this pattern of

693
01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:10.590
David Schaich (he): microstates

694
01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:14.850
David Schaich (he): ranging from the ground state energy to

695
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:20.620
David Schaich (he): the negative of the ground state and the g of maximum possible energy in steps of the Energy Gap.

696
01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:26.350
David Schaich (he): It is he to legal

697
01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:33.600
David Schaich (he): each microstates and i'll call. Now, we'll make a K.

698
01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:40.260
David Schaich (he): With the corresponding energy. So is okay.

699
01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.450
David Schaich (he): which is

700
01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:46.330
David Schaich (he): the ground State energy minus N. H.

701
01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.670
David Schaich (he): Plus

702
01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:51.710
David Schaich (he): some number of factors. K.

703
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:53.570
David Schaich (he): Times that energy J.

704
01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.990
David Schaich (he): Of 2 inch

705
01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:03.060
we can rearrange by pulling out

706
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:05.670
David Schaich (he): a factor of minus H.

707
01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.800
David Schaich (he): Just have n minus 2 K. Left over.

708
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:11.650
David Schaich (he): Okay, here

709
01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:14.430
David Schaich (he): is ranging now from

710
01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:15.670
David Schaich (he): 0

711
01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.860
David Schaich (he): all the way up to in

712
01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:21.460
David Schaich (he): counting the integer

713
01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:29.230
David Schaich (he): states that we can have. and we can check when K. Is 0. We get that graph, say energy when K is n

714
01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:35.960
David Schaich (he): n minus 2, K is minus and the negative cancel out, and we get the maximum positive energy.

715
01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:38.940
David Schaich (he): And with this

716
01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:49.300
David Schaich (he): set up another 7 notation that's more convenient for the case of indistinguishable spends. We go through exactly the same procedure

717
01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.150
David Schaich (he): which will become familiar

718
01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:57.200
David Schaich (he): in the analyses based on the canonical ensemble.

719
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:59.530
David Schaich (he): He starts

720
01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:03.140
David Schaich (he): with the partition function.

721
01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:11.020
David Schaich (he): So I now for indistinguishable spins.

722
01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:17.260
David Schaich (he): This is the sum overall microstates. E to the

723
01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.940
David Schaich (he): minus energy over temperature

724
01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:23.520
David Schaich (he): microstates. Now one

725
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:26.700
David Schaich (he): from table 0, the end.

726
01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:29.160
David Schaich (he): The energy

727
01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.460
David Schaich (he): is

728
01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.420
David Schaich (he): minus h times

729
01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:40.000
David Schaich (he): and minus 2 K.

730
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:46.000
David Schaich (he): The minus one over t

731
01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.490
David Schaich (he): is equal to Beta.

732
01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:54.780
David Schaich (he): So the exponential of a difference is

733
01:07:56.030 --> 01:08:07.350
David Schaich (he): the product of exponentials. So dividing that into E to the and beta h times e to the minus 2. K. Beta H.

734
01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:11.760
David Schaich (he): Can pull out this overall factor

735
01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:15.510
David Schaich (he): that does not depend on K.

736
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.140
David Schaich (he): And what's left in the sum.

737
01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:30.200
David Schaich (he): There's an E to the minus 2 K Beta H. Which, using another property of exponentials. we can write

738
01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:33.510
David Schaich (he): because e to the minus 2 Beta H

739
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:35.580
David Schaich (he): raised to the power K:

740
01:08:37.649 --> 01:08:48.810
David Schaich (he): So the E to the minus 2, Beta H. Is that same exponential factor depending on the energy gap that we solve. becoming relevant for distinguishable spins at low temperatures.

741
01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:51.950
David Schaich (he): and the sum of some

742
01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:58.470
David Schaich (he): number raised to the K power is again another

743
01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:02.090
David Schaich (he): avatar of the geometric series

744
01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:04.260
David Schaich (he): that

745
01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.220
David Schaich (he): also popped up in

746
01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:08.319
David Schaich (he): our previous analyses.

747
01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:13.770
David Schaich (he): The complication here is that the sum does not run all the way from 0 to infinity.

748
01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:16.319
David Schaich (he): It was only from

749
01:09:16.930 --> 01:09:21.090
David Schaich (he): 8 equals 0 to some finite number of particles.

750
01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:28.630
David Schaich (he): Counting the finite number of Microsoft that we have. we can

751
01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:32.240
David Schaich (he): do a little mathematical trick to

752
01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:41.130
David Schaich (he): deal with this. my writing this as the difference between 2 over the 5 geometric series.

753
01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:50.649
David Schaich (he): next to the power K, some from a 0 to infinity. and then subtracting all from by turn everything

754
01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:53.920
David Schaich (he): larger than X to the power in.

755
01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:02.100
David Schaich (he): We should always be cautious when rearranging infinite sums.

756
01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:11.770
David Schaich (he): In this way This is one rearrangement that turns out to be legitimate and not cause some problems. Every with the power of X to the

757
01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:16.420
David Schaich (he): and plus one or higher cancels off between these 2 series.

758
01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:18.910
David Schaich (he): and that's what it our target

759
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.070
David Schaich (he): Reading X as

760
01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.720
David Schaich (he): E. To the minus 2 Beta H.

761
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:25.990
David Schaich (he): Which

762
01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:32.030
David Schaich (he): you know, it has

763
01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:44.790
David Schaich (he): magnitude less than one so greater than 0 thinks of properties of that exponential function. In fact, with the temperature and magnetic field

764
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:46.500
David Schaich (he): Positive.

765
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:50.820
David Schaich (he): So this geometric series is the

766
01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.070
David Schaich (he): one over one minus x that we saw before. If we

767
01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:58.620
David Schaich (he): cool out

768
01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:09.750
David Schaich (he): the factor of X to the n plus one that appears in every term. and this expression. So x to the end force one.

769
01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:12.500
David Schaich (he): We can then some

770
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:20.100
David Schaich (he): a power of X to the L. Where L is what is left after pulling out n plus one.

771
01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:24.540
David Schaich (he): So all the self w from 0 to infinity.

772
01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:28.680
David Schaich (he): Another geometric series that gives us

773
01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.830
David Schaich (he): in total one minus x to the n plus one

774
01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.500
David Schaich (he): divided by one minus x.

775
01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:42.970
David Schaich (he): So, plugging this into the partition function.

776
01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:47.210
David Schaich (he): We're x's. The exponential of

777
01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:53.190
David Schaich (he): minus 2 Beta h. We have that overall factor

778
01:11:57.290 --> 01:12:03.550
David Schaich (he): times this ratio. one by the C minus 2 n plus one.

779
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:07.830
David Schaich (he): By the by.

780
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:12.160
David Schaich (he): just that one minus x.

781
01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:15.610
David Schaich (he): Our x is e to the minus 2 beta h

782
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:20.540
David Schaich (he): can be it corresponding

783
01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:26.070
David Schaich (he): hope. It's free energy.

784
01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:32.390
David Schaich (he): It is.

785
01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:37.370
David Schaich (he): You see here.

786
01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:40.560
David Schaich (he): logarithm of this partition function

787
01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:45.400
David Schaich (he): divided by that. So we get 3

788
01:12:46.410 --> 01:12:53.460
David Schaich (he): terms in this logarithm. If you break up that product in the partition function into a sum of the logs.

789
01:12:53.880 --> 01:13:01.200
David Schaich (he): the first is the and then the overall negative sign.

790
01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:05.040
David Schaich (he): It is cancel. and we have an H.

791
01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:11.070
David Schaich (he): Then we pick up the logarithm of that Numerator.

792
01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.570
David Schaich (he): Yeah, one over paid up.

793
01:13:15.150 --> 01:13:17.690
David Schaich (he): It's not cancel. It's his

794
01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:20.340
David Schaich (he): power of n plus one

795
01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:23.560
David Schaich (he): in the exponential

796
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:30.250
David Schaich (he): and the logarithm of one over the function brings in an additional

797
01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:39.510
David Schaich (he): negative negative sign that cancel out the definition of help that's free energy. And this is just the more rhythm

798
01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:49.010
David Schaich (he): of the one minus E to the minus 2 beta h in the denominator. So this is

799
01:13:54.780 --> 01:14:07.410
David Schaich (he): clearly difference compared to the that we can. And in case of the remind you, what's that?

800
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:13.320
David Schaich (he): More than twice the kind of like cosine of Beta H, the overall factor of.

801
01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:16.750
David Schaich (he): and i'll be it over at times, the temperature T.

802
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.620
David Schaich (he): And this in turn

803
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:24.780
David Schaich (he): I need to

804
01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.500
David Schaich (he): different results for

805
01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.260
David Schaich (he): the average internal energy

806
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:35.960
David Schaich (he): and the entropy in the case of indistinguishable spins.

807
01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:39.590
David Schaich (he): which is not on the homework you tomorrow, but will be on the

808
01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:43.620
David Schaich (he): second homework assignment, not due until after the break.

809
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:49.650
David Schaich (he): You may want to start working through this calculation, while

810
01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:57.000
David Schaich (he): the derivation is a question of what we can look at, just to

811
01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:58.880
David Schaich (he): wrap up

812
01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.210
David Schaich (he): this application of the

813
01:15:04.230 --> 01:15:05.720
David Schaich (he): our comparisons

814
01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.670
David Schaich (he): between the

815
01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:14.390
David Schaich (he): energies and entropies, or distinguishable versus indistinguishable spins which

816
01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:25.000
David Schaich (he): it's for clarity. I've now put on to separate obviously solid blue ones are the same distinguishable results that we had

817
01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.410
David Schaich (he): previously, and

818
01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:39.090
David Schaich (he): you will find that the in distributional results do not have overall factors in. but it can't be evenly divided out by in this way.

819
01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:46.900
David Schaich (he): So what's being done in these spots is that in it's being fixed to 4,

820
01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.910
David Schaich (he): so a few things to

821
01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:52.250
David Schaich (he): notes

822
01:15:53.370 --> 01:15:57.100
David Schaich (he): about the behavior of the energy and entropy.

823
01:15:57.540 --> 01:16:09.120
David Schaich (he): Hey, there! These 2 cases with different information, content First of all. yeah limits of both the energy and the entropy

824
01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.800
David Schaich (he): at F 0 temperature are the same.

825
01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.040
David Schaich (he): So this is the case where

826
01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:39.660
David Schaich (he): the ground state is essentially controlling all aspects of the system can do it. The single ground state is the same for

827
01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:44.340
David Schaich (he): both cases of distinguishable, and in the

828
01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:47.500
David Schaich (he): you can also see that

829
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:56.320
David Schaich (he): in both cases there is a faster conversions to that ground state. In the in the sensual case, the red dash down the lines.

830
01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:02.370
David Schaich (he): You so are always smaller than the the similar case that it's just due to

831
01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:07.800
David Schaich (he): the smaller number of microstates that we have on the spins are indistinguishable

832
01:17:10.650 --> 01:17:13.000
David Schaich (he): in the limit of high temperatures.

833
01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:24.780
David Schaich (he): The energy

834
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:29.740
David Schaich (he): always goes to

835
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:33.110
David Schaich (he): 0. As t approaches, infinity

836
01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.000
David Schaich (he): again

837
01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:39.020
David Schaich (he): approaches this more slowly. So

838
01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:40.720
David Schaich (he): that is the

839
01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:42.540
okay sure

840
01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:45.690
David Schaich (he): high temperature limits.

841
01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.080
David Schaich (he): and there's someone

842
01:17:48.270 --> 01:17:51.790
David Schaich (he): quicker approach in the distinguishable case.

843
01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:55.080
David Schaich (he): Then, for the in this single one.

844
01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:03.010
David Schaich (he): and something more interesting happens for the entropy.

845
01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:06.430
David Schaich (he): so

846
01:18:13.050 --> 01:18:13.950
David Schaich (he): that

847
01:18:15.930 --> 01:18:17.770
David Schaich (he): in the high temperature limits

848
01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:23.530
David Schaich (he): the individual entropy. S. I

849
01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.600
David Schaich (he): approaches

850
01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:35.860
David Schaich (he): the board of N plus one, which is the the dashboard line shown here rather than approaching

851
01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:38.290
David Schaich (he): the logarithm of 2;

852
01:18:40.890 --> 01:18:42.230
David Schaich (he): and this is

853
01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.260
David Schaich (he): again

854
01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:50.100
David Schaich (he): in correspondence to the number of microstates that we have in the system

855
01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:53.950
David Schaich (he): compared to the

856
01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:59.130
David Schaich (he): exponentially fewer microstates

857
01:19:02.290 --> 01:19:13.610
David Schaich (he): to some over in the partition function. and plus one in the in this initial case versus 2 to the end which we can't.

858
01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:15.240
David Schaich (he): the exponential

859
01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:18.220
David Schaich (he): of en block 2.

860
01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:23.520
David Schaich (he): So this leads to

861
01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:28.150
David Schaich (he): a clear difference between the entropy

862
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:35.600
David Schaich (he): depending on the pure information content of these systems, which maybe

863
01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:38.350
David Schaich (he): what you had expected, given the

864
01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:46.040
David Schaich (he): sort of way of interpreting entropy as the amount of information

865
01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:47.080
David Schaich (he): that is

866
01:19:47.890 --> 01:19:54.860
David Schaich (he): obtainable without a system, a concept you may well have encountered. If we're taking this module, we just now put that on

867
01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.220
David Schaich (he): you. That medical foundation from the canonical ensemble. There you are

868
01:20:02.650 --> 01:20:11.660
David Schaich (he): an application of probability spaces with fixed temperature and technical number. Maybe more striking. Is that

869
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:15.720
David Schaich (he): the energy itself to something that is

870
01:20:16.230 --> 01:20:20.400
David Schaich (he): alright. a simple and straightforward thing to measure

871
01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:22.490
David Schaich (he): in experiments.

872
01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:23.710
David Schaich (he): Yes.

873
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:27.460
David Schaich (he): clearly difference between

874
01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:35.880
David Schaich (he): these 2 different systems of distinguishable and in the central space. So, even though the 2 systems approach the same 0 temperature limits

875
01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:39.530
David Schaich (he): and the same high temperature limit they go with go to

876
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:43.360
David Schaich (he): 0. As the temperature goes through infinity.

877
01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:47.330
David Schaich (he): They both go to minus one. With this normalization.

878
01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:50.420
David Schaich (he): as the temperature goes to absolute 0.

879
01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:51.950
David Schaich (he): If we were to

880
01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:56.510
David Schaich (he): measure the energies of these systems at any non-zero temperature.

881
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:58.590
David Schaich (he): I would get

882
01:20:58.950 --> 01:21:02.210
David Schaich (he): different results that would actually allow us to

883
01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:07.590
David Schaich (he): determine in principle whether this spin or is it distinguishable or not.

884
01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:10.920
David Schaich (he): It's just to say they're

885
01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:15.450
David Schaich (he): physically measurable effect

886
01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:26.660
David Schaich (he): from the intrinsic information content

887
01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:39.910
David Schaich (he): of the 2 types of students systems we've worked at a measurement of the energy will tell us what is knowable about the screens in principle, even if we

888
01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.400
David Schaich (he): No, no a priori.

889
01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.710
David Schaich (he): Which

890
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:48.960
David Schaich (he): type of system we're looking at, whether the spins are distinguishable or not.

891
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:57.610
David Schaich (he): This is a physical manifestation of pure information remains.

892
01:21:59.070 --> 01:22:05.880
David Schaich (he): hey? Very active field and research. Yeah. let's see. Famous

893
01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:10.470
David Schaich (he): quote by

894
01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:25.920
David Schaich (he): that information. so is physical. informs the foundation for a great deal of physical behavior.

895
01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:29.430
David Schaich (he): So

896
01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:33.930
David Schaich (he): that was that reps up. This

897
01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:40.650
David Schaich (he): first application of the canonical sample. Looking at the physics of the information we got through the

898
01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:52.630
David Schaich (he): in distinguishable case a bit more quickly because you get to do some of the boarding work yourself, turning through the derivatives and the limits to

899
01:22:52.690 --> 01:23:05.850
David Schaich (he): get the predictions that we looked at any questions before we move on to something else, a different application of the canonical ensemble.

900
01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:17.120
David Schaich (he): The next application that

901
01:23:17.570 --> 01:23:21.400
David Schaich (he): we won't wrap up today, and i'll probably continue

902
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:22.760
David Schaich (he): is next week

903
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:27.510
David Schaich (he): is

904
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:32.670
David Schaich (he): here. You are

905
01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:35.610
David Schaich (he): the famous topic that

906
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:39.180
David Schaich (he): you may well have heard about in

907
01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:41.270
David Schaich (he): a levels or other modules.

908
01:23:43.190 --> 01:23:44.880
David Schaich (he): ideal gases.

909
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:51.520
David Schaich (he): and in contrast to the a level where we will be deriving the

910
01:23:51.770 --> 01:24:00.680
David Schaich (he): behavior about real gases, things known as the ideal gas wall from the fundamental microscopic dynamics

911
01:24:01.190 --> 01:24:03.330
David Schaich (he): analyzed with the

912
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:12.120
David Schaich (he): tools of statistical physics that we have developed. and at least for the time being. we will start off. I saw

913
01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:15.330
David Schaich (he): application by considering it

914
01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:19.970
David Schaich (he): a particular sort of ideal gas

915
01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:25.570
David Schaich (he): bicycle

916
01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:30.020
David Schaich (he): Ideal gas is

917
01:24:30.650 --> 01:24:33.430
David Schaich (he): so let's break down what

918
01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:42.220
David Schaich (he): each of these terms meetings and tells us about the system we're going to be looking at the classical one, is

919
01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:57.260
David Schaich (he): it is not quantum. and since I don't expect you to know anything about quantum physics for this module. All this news that you don't have to worry about, that it's a

920
01:24:57.630 --> 01:25:01.760
David Schaich (he): a gas that behaves as we are used to thinking about

921
01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:13.960
David Schaich (he): ever since Newton wrote down his loss of motion 350 years ago. In particular. we can assume that we and it know exactly

922
01:25:14.410 --> 01:25:23.110
David Schaich (he): you both the position and the momentum of every particle and

923
01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:25.930
David Schaich (he): three-dimensional space.

924
01:25:26.650 --> 01:25:30.900
David Schaich (he): So that position is labeled by the next Y and Z

925
01:25:31.770 --> 01:25:40.820
David Schaich (he): in 3 dimensions left, right up, down, forward, backward, and there's a corresponding component of the momentum in each of those 3 directions.

926
01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.220
David Schaich (he): I guess similarly to not having to worry about quantum physics.

927
01:25:46.590 --> 01:25:47.470
David Schaich (he): The

928
01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:52.240
David Schaich (he): that means we don't have to worry about

929
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:57.160
David Schaich (he): relativistic effects. So each particle in these gases

930
01:26:00.210 --> 01:26:11.630
David Schaich (he): alright, go on and you moving slowly we are slowly measured compared to the of what 300 millionmeters per second.

931
01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:22.040
David Schaich (he): so we can ignore the effects of relativity and the energy of each particle in

932
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:24.000
David Schaich (he): It's just going to be

933
01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:36.820
David Schaich (he): usual expression that I suspect you've seen before one over twice the mass of the Particle Times. the square of its momentum. Where this is.

934
01:26:39.630 --> 01:26:44.170
David Schaich (he): you get your product over the free components of that momentum.

935
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:46.040
David Schaich (he): So pn squared.

936
01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:47.900
David Schaich (he): Yes.

937
01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:59.940
David Schaich (he): so of squares. P. X squared plus p y squared

938
01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:05.740
in. Here

939
01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:09.200
David Schaich (he): is the mass of each particle.

940
01:27:12.710 --> 01:27:14.770
David Schaich (he): The final adjective that

941
01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:17.030
David Schaich (he): we have here

942
01:27:18.230 --> 01:27:20.960
David Schaich (he): is dealing with an ideal gas.

943
01:27:21.330 --> 01:27:22.390
David Schaich (he): and this is

944
01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:24.340
David Schaich (he): there. You go

945
01:27:25.050 --> 01:27:28.620
David Schaich (he): even more significant simplification. Because

946
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:34.220
David Schaich (he): what ideal means in this context is that there are no interactions.

947
01:27:37.630 --> 01:27:40.050
David Schaich (he): queen any of the individual particles

948
01:27:41.370 --> 01:27:44.290
David Schaich (he): in the gas, so that people will allergy

949
01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:53.430
David Schaich (he): in micro-states with n particles. It's just given by the sum over the

950
01:27:55.100 --> 01:28:01.550
David Schaich (he): individual energy and squared of each of those and particles all assumed to have

951
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:05.580
David Schaich (he): the same mass, so particles of the same species.

952
01:28:07.330 --> 01:28:10.810
David Schaich (he): the cost of mass, and we can pull out of that. So

953
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:19.680
David Schaich (he): So the setup that we're going to have gets back to the the picture that we

954
01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.280
David Schaich (he): starting off looking at today.

955
01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:32.490
David Schaich (he): Some collection of particles place in the volume at this temperature. and for an ideal gaps

956
01:28:36.130 --> 01:28:42.060
David Schaich (he): turn out to be significant. So we will need to discuss that with some care.

957
01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:42.930
So

958
01:28:44.770 --> 01:28:46.700
David Schaich (he): our usual canonical setup.

959
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:49.620
David Schaich (he): because in particles

960
01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:52.640
David Schaich (he): good for you.

961
01:28:57.810 --> 01:29:01.650
David Schaich (he): It's by that large external, formal reservoir.

962
01:29:06.170 --> 01:29:09.460
David Schaich (he): and to be concrete. you will say that the

963
01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:15.010
David Schaich (he): container that we're putting these end particles up the gas in.

964
01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:18.590
David Schaich (he): He is a cubic box.

965
01:29:23.770 --> 01:29:36.220
David Schaich (he): and it's just 3 powers of in length in each of the 3 mentions of space that we have to deal with. So X. Why, him said. are you changing from

966
01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:37.790
David Schaich (he): 0 to l

967
01:29:41.130 --> 01:29:42.780
David Schaich (he): of that in the alignment.

968
01:29:44.770 --> 01:29:54.550
David Schaich (he): and as always with the to see third time today that we want to start.

969
01:29:58.070 --> 01:30:02.000
David Schaich (he): It's the partition function all right again.

970
01:30:06.710 --> 01:30:10.070
David Schaich (he): because we have a

971
01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.340
David Schaich (he): problem here. We try to think about

972
01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:26.700
David Schaich (he): bicycle ideal gas particle instead. You might have been considering it at the start of today's lecture.

973
01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:31.560
David Schaich (he): This partition function is summing over all microstates.

974
01:30:31.870 --> 01:30:34.740
David Schaich (he): Those microstates are fine

975
01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:38.310
David Schaich (he): by the energy and the energy in turn

976
01:30:40.570 --> 01:30:43.570
David Schaich (he): by the momenta. So yeah.

977
01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:51.380
David Schaich (he): energy ei of each microstates. he's coming problem.

978
01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:54.020
David Schaich (he): And

979
01:30:57.340 --> 01:30:59.660
David Schaich (he): we vector momento. And we

980
01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:05.990
David Schaich (he): would assume in the classical context, just to be continuous real numbers.

981
01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:07.900
David Schaich (he): In other words, there are

982
01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:13.840
David Schaich (he): an uncountably infinite number of momenta, even for a single particle.

983
01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:16.870
David Schaich (he): So how to you

984
01:31:17.170 --> 01:31:23.550
David Schaich (he): terms in this partition function. Assuming that we have a countable number of Microsoft system over is

985
01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.170
David Schaich (he): and ill posed

986
01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:27.450
David Schaich (he): proposition.

987
01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:30.560
David Schaich (he): So

988
01:31:31.730 --> 01:31:33.160
David Schaich (he): the sum here

989
01:31:35.530 --> 01:31:41.310
David Schaich (he): is a problem when we have continuous moments up and uncountably infinite

990
01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:44.290
David Schaich (he): number of microstates to account for.

991
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:55.920
David Schaich (he): and the solution is not necessarily thinking about this. What we need to do

992
01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:00.500
David Schaich (he): handle. This situation

993
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:03.710
David Schaich (he): is a procedure known as regularization.

994
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:19.600
David Schaich (he): So we need to regulate the system and what this means exactly express the system in terms of countable microstates

995
01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:24.060
David Schaich (he): that we and so over

996
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:26.360
David Schaich (he): 2,

997
01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:31.360
David Schaich (he): a well-defined partition function.

998
01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.430
David Schaich (he): And then.

999
01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:45.220
David Schaich (he): after we have that modified partition, function. you take the limits in which the

1000
01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:49.070
David Schaich (he): some can be expressed as

1001
01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:58.170
David Schaich (he): integral over the continuous degrees of freedom that we want to consider it. So what we will do is to

1002
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:02.500
David Schaich (he): declare as a regularization

1003
01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:09.800
David Schaich (he): that only certainly moment so are possible.

1004
01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:19.540
David Schaich (he): So, rather than the momentum for each particle being continuous, real numbers.

1005
01:33:20.850 --> 01:33:21.780
David Schaich (he): you will

1006
01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:25.190
David Schaich (he): the people we allowed

1007
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:27.610
David Schaich (he): moment of the Xq. Line.

1008
01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:30.790
David Schaich (he): he said. Take the form

1009
01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:36.760
David Schaich (he): of some pre-factor. That depends on the length of our volume.

1010
01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:39.790
David Schaich (he): Times is pure numbers

1011
01:33:40.210 --> 01:33:43.520
David Schaich (he): K. X. K. Y. And K. Z.

1012
01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:46.140
David Schaich (he): Where each of these numbers

1013
01:33:48.710 --> 01:33:58.230
David Schaich (he): is a non-negative integer starting from 0, that goes off to infinity. So there is still an infinite number of. But you are obviously

1014
01:33:58.770 --> 01:34:01.760
David Schaich (he): countable because we are accounting them here.

1015
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:17.470
David Schaich (he): It's pre-factor and H. Bar. He is known as the plank it so really less interesting than it looks. All it is is a unit conversion

1016
01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:19.010
David Schaich (he): factor

1017
01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:21.300
David Schaich (he): that's

1018
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:28.300
David Schaich (he): the inverse length one over L on the right hand side of this equation.

1019
01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:32.560
David Schaich (he): The the moments of he that we have on the left hand side.

1020
01:34:34.290 --> 01:34:40.180
David Schaich (he): and this is some. It's something you may have heard about or encountered before.

1021
01:34:40.230 --> 01:34:41.530
David Schaich (he): because we have

1022
01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:47.080
David Schaich (he): chosen a set of

1023
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:50.200
David Schaich (he): discrete momentum that

1024
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:56.000
David Schaich (he): turn out to be similar to those that are realized in nature sometimes call

1025
01:34:57.770 --> 01:34:59.460
David Schaich (he): quantized momenta

1026
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:08.430
David Schaich (he): basis of quantum physics.

1027
01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:18.570
David Schaich (he): However, I should say that here we're not doing anything quantum. What we are doing is just imposing an odds

1028
01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:22.430
David Schaich (he): on what allowed moment to

1029
01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:26.260
David Schaich (he): we have that are accountable. It can give us their efficient function.

1030
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:30.020
And then

1031
01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:35.480
David Schaich (he): the fact that this ons is a physically relevant one is just a nice coincidence

1032
01:35:36.510 --> 01:35:37.640
David Schaich (he): that

1033
01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:44.030
David Schaich (he): we we will revisit later in the Module.

1034
01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:52.870
David Schaich (he): When we do consider autumn gases we are, there is some physics countenance to each on Thomas Momenta.

1035
01:35:55.210 --> 01:35:57.960
David Schaich (he): See the time

1036
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:01.110
David Schaich (he): so

1037
01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:04.390
David Schaich (he): wrap up today with one

1038
01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:06.560
David Schaich (he): final step

1039
01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:08.900
David Schaich (he): at the

1040
01:36:13.390 --> 01:36:18.740
David Schaich (he): the energies that we have based on these discrete momentum

1041
01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:24.400
David Schaich (he): are also discrete and countable.

1042
01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:28.100
David Schaich (he): So we had. Yes.

1043
01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.600
David Schaich (he): the energy for

1044
01:36:35.150 --> 01:36:39.030
David Schaich (he): certain particle was P. Squared over 2 M.

1045
01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:41.070
David Schaich (he): We have

1046
01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:51.880
David Schaich (he): this expression for P. So we can substitute in to get an H bar squared high, squared over 2, and L. Squared

1047
01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:54.900
David Schaich (he): with

1048
01:36:55.940 --> 01:37:08.450
David Schaich (he): from the inner product is some of those 3 numbers K. Eightx squared, plus k is that square which we can call just a constant script. E

1049
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:09.950
David Schaich (he): times.

1050
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:18.530
David Schaich (he): Yes. 3 squared numbers.

1051
01:37:20.210 --> 01:37:21.290
David Schaich (he): So

1052
01:37:23.970 --> 01:37:30.800
David Schaich (he): you see here, we can read off. Hr. Squared high, squared over 2 and L squared. and

1053
01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:34.400
David Schaich (he): we see that the

1054
01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:38.780
David Schaich (he): Lewis energy is again to fall into

1055
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:43.680
David Schaich (he): energy levels similar to what we had with the spin system.

1056
01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:53.390
David Schaich (he): with some differences. save that in terms of the possible numbers. the possible energies that we can have.

1057
01:37:53.750 --> 01:38:00.830
David Schaich (he): So the lowest possible energy when each of a X K. Y. In case that are 0, is just 0.

1058
01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:12.090
David Schaich (he): You can then have. I know, one of those 3. You need one. We need 2 of the 3 being one, so we have one plus one is 2 for free.

1059
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:20.760
David Schaich (he): If one of them is 2 or 2 squared is 4, we could have a 4 plus one plus 0,

1060
01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:23.130
David Schaich (he): 4 plus one plus one.

1061
01:38:24.530 --> 01:38:30.780
David Schaich (he): Then we have to go on to Hello. 2 of them being 2

1062
01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:34.620
David Schaich (he): should be 4 plus 4 plus 0 gives 8.

1063
01:38:35.410 --> 01:38:43.360
David Schaich (he): I One of them is 3, 10, and 11. If all 3 are 2.

1064
01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:57.700
David Schaich (he): If one is 3, and one is 2, we have 9, plus 4, it's 13, yeah, 14 for 9 plus 4 plus one.

1065
01:38:58.250 --> 01:39:01.990
David Schaich (he): Then we jump to 9, plus 4 plus 4, which is

1066
01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:05.800
David Schaich (he): 17, and you can go on from there.

1067
01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:11.770
David Schaich (he): What we know is that in contrast to the spin system

1068
01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:17.070
David Schaich (he): these energies are not all, even in space. There's no cost in energy. J.

1069
01:39:17.630 --> 01:39:19.170
David Schaich (he): We don't have

1070
01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:24.870
David Schaich (he): any way too good step in

1071
01:39:26.610 --> 01:39:28.790
David Schaich (he): 15 and 16 or

1072
01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:37.980
David Schaich (he): I'm sorry. No, it's. You can get 16 from the 4 squared, but we can't get 15,

1073
01:39:38.010 --> 01:39:43.450
David Schaich (he): and there will be similar gaps in the possible energies as we go higher up. So

1074
01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:53.440
David Schaich (he): sorry for a couple of minutes over. That's we're all stop for now. The next call for questions about this and the pick up with the partition function for

1075
01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:58.190
David Schaich (he): ideal gases tomorrow afternoon, not in this room, but back

1076
01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.400
David Schaich (he): next door. I'm told that the

1077
01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:06.660
David Schaich (he): fixed. So we won't. Have a repeat of the issue of last time

1078
01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:16.520
David Schaich (he): the work with the homework at all. See you tomorrow. Yeah.
