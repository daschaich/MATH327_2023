1
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.760
David Schaich (he): Okay, I think we should go ahead and

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.210
David Schaich (he): get started.  I'll

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.350
David Schaich (he): put the code up on the board for any stragglers

4
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.620
David Schaich (he): I'll put it on the projected notes as well before moving on:

7
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.460
David Schaich (he): at 9AM on the twentieth of March, the 6 digit code

8
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.400
David Schaich (he): 2, 4, 9, 9, 0, 8.

9
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.160
David Schaich (he): For those of you dialing in from off campus.

10
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.570
David Schaich (he): And, what do we have for today?

11
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.400
David Schaich (he): First, let's see if there are any questions about what we covered last week

12
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.130
David Schaich (he): and I'll remind you what those topics were. We focused on

13
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.550
David Schaich (he): thermodynamic cycles using pressure--volume diagrams as a tool to analyze those

14
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.100
David Schaich (he): to find their efficiency.

15
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.870
And looking in most detail at the

16
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.500
David Schaich (he): Carnot cycle that realizes the maximum possible efficiency of a heat engine

17
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.280
or refrigerator.

18
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:37.370
David Schaich (he): depending on which way it's run. And then in the tutorial he started looking at the Otto cycle, the exercise for you being to check out its efficiency and compare that with the Carnot cycle.

19
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.860
David Schaich (he): you've been

20
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.530
David Schaich (he): turn to

21
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.010
David Schaich (he): our third statistical ensemble for

22
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.500
David Schaich (he): this module, the grand canonical, unsolvable and going through.

23
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.530
David Schaich (he): Video.

24
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.760
David Schaich (he): Let's see

25
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.170
David Schaich (he): function going through the

26
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.800
David Schaich (he): same replica trick that we use for the canonical on the

27
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.530
David Schaich (he): putting in place a realistic on dots for

28
00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:19.030
David Schaich (he): it's particle reservoir with which the system can exchange. Now both energy and particles. We derived the great economical analog of the partition function.

29
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.510
David Schaich (he): some over all microstates, I, the exponential

30
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.570
David Schaich (he): E, to the minus inverse temperature times, the energy of that microstate minus the chemical potential.

31
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.370
the number of

32
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:43.120
David Schaich (he): so that the corresponding probabilities for microstates, Omega I. Is the generalization of the ultimate factor. We didn't buy it

33
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.090
David Schaich (he): this great canonical partition function.

34
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.900
David Schaich (he): and we will go on today to derive

35
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:57.120
David Schaich (he): large steel properties of great economical systems from this starting point. But before we do, are there any questions about

36
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.350
David Schaich (he): what we saw last week, or what we got up to in our development of the grand canonical ensemble.

37
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.460
David Schaich (he): So the plan for they includes not only derived quantities.

38
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:25.100
David Schaich (he): but also you'll probably get through those pretty quickly and then look into quantum statistics as Yeah.

39
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.240
David Schaich (he): As an intermediate step we're applying the grand canonical partition function to

40
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.960
David Schaich (he): the canonical ensemble to classical ideal gases. So the drives quantities are going to be

41
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.800
David Schaich (he): based on

42
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:58.370
David Schaich (he): partition function. Our starting point for any mathematical analyses of systems for about the energy and particle number is allowed to fluctuate. and these include some of the

43
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.870
David Schaich (he): usual targets, like the entropy. Now, as a function of temperature and chemical potential

44
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.330
David Schaich (he): rather than temperature and

45
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.420
David Schaich (he): particle number or energy particle number. This was the case in the

46
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.550
David Schaich (he): micro canonical ensemble

47
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.180
David Schaich (he): that remains the same sum over microstates of microstate probabilities pi times their water that holds.

48
00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.360
David Schaich (he): or any

49
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.280
David Schaich (he): statistical ensemble. Given the appropriate form of the microstates probabilities.

50
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.680
David Schaich (he): and also.

51
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.640
David Schaich (he): like we did, for

52
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.480
not a cool

53
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:46.280
David Schaich (he): ensemble. We want to consider the expectation value of the internal energy which flexibility fluctuates from Microsoft to Microsoft. It still has a We'll be fine

54
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:59.730
David Schaich (he): and smoothly varying expectations, are you? It also depends on the temperature and chemical potential, and as with all the some of the

55
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:07.690
David Schaich (he): energy 4 inch microstate, with the probability of that Microsoft which we can log in from our work last week.

56
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.370
David Schaich (he): Yes.

57
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.500
David Schaich (he): and the exponential factor

58
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.880
David Schaich (he): weighted by the overall great economical partition function.

59
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:28.030
David Schaich (he): So this looks much the same as the canonical case. Just the addition of the chemical potential and particle number for every microstates.

60
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.430
David Schaich (he): The new

61
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.010
David Schaich (he): is not really sensible in the canonical ones. On what is the particle

62
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.770
number

63
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.410
David Schaich (he): just now

64
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.640
fluctuates just like the energy of and fixed. So it's expectation value.

65
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.680
David Schaich (he): Another function of he.

66
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.530
She'll also be varying

67
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.520
David Schaich (he): also the particle number for each microstate waited by

68
00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:01.350
David Schaich (he): microstate probability. so the same expression as a energy

69
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.420
David Schaich (he): exchange with the particle number in the sum of microstates.

70
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.740
David Schaich (he): and continuing the analogy with economical ensemble.

71
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.330
David Schaich (he): All of these can be related to

72
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.780
David Schaich (he): derivatives. Oh.

73
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.440
David Schaich (he): the water room

74
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.540
David Schaich (he): of the great economical partition function.

75
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.640
David Schaich (he): which. in the grey economical case.

76
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.070
David Schaich (he): quantity.

77
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.460
David Schaich (he): You notice the Grand Canonical potential

78
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:01.960
David Schaich (he): up to you and you. and it's the grand canonical animal of the free energy.

79
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:13.800
David Schaich (he): which is to say. 5 is negative temperature, times water of that screen economical partition function so rearranging

80
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.730
David Schaich (he): that relation. You can express the partition function just as the exponential

81
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.090
minus 5 over t

82
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.140
David Schaich (he): the microstate probabilities from both.

83
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.430
David Schaich (he): and the cast of the 4,

84
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:34.230
the

85
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:46.870
David Schaich (he): single exponential with the one of them. On this bike and positive 5. Mine is Microsoft energy plus New time particle number.

86
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.270
David Schaich (he): all divided by the temperature.

87
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.240
David Schaich (he): and sometimes to

88
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:59.680
David Schaich (he): highlights the similarity between this grand canonical potential and the help of its free energy. This.

89
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:06.650
David Schaich (he): Oh, excuse me you land out free energy.

90
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.510
How is it?

91
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.730
David Schaich (he): Twentieth century?

92
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:16.550
David Schaich (he): Roughly, a 100 years after hell holds and

93
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:27.920
David Schaich (he): making contributions to many areas of physics, including the you're looking at. Possibly this week we definitely

94
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.950
right again.

95
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:36.539
David Schaich (he): and one other into It's putting home disease here.

96
00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:39.860
David Schaich (he): These relations.

97
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.570
David Schaich (he): unlike the general definitions

98
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:51.530
David Schaich (he): about, do assume a thermodynamic equilibrium that we've gone through the process of maximizing the entropy

99
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.220
David Schaich (he): in order to make this relation between

100
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.440
David Schaich (he): the pre economical potential and

101
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.050
David Schaich (he): all these qualities. But that okay said so

102
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.950
David Schaich (he): the claim that these are related. So let's actually see how that

103
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:18.880
David Schaich (he): operates in practice by looking at derivatives of the screen canonical potential which now depends on both temperature and chemical potential.

104
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:23.190
David Schaich (he): If we take the derivative with respect to chemical potential

105
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:29.820
David Schaich (he): when the temperature fixed. then we can pull out that minus t factor.

106
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.190
David Schaich (he): It's for file. It is a minus one over

107
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.360
David Schaich (he): inverse temperature, Beta. And then we have

108
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.470
David Schaich (he): the derivative of the logarithm

109
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:46.250
David Schaich (he): of the grand canonical potential with respect to chemical potential, which

110
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.100
David Schaich (he): whatever is a G factor

111
00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.730
derivative of that G.

112
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.620
David Schaich (he): At some over microstates.

113
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:06.120
David Schaich (he): Derivative With respect to the chemical potential. all of our exponential.

114
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.490
David Schaich (he): a factor depending on both

115
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:25.370
David Schaich (he): energy and particle number. So what this will do is bring down a positive that you're a beta times. and I and they will cancel out the one over data.

116
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.850
David Schaich (he): leaving just

117
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.300
David Schaich (he): hey, you one over. So my

118
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.250
that same

119
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.480
David Schaich (he): exponential factor

120
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:44.990
David Schaich (he): which we can immediately recognize as the microstate probability. We saw it, and making some

121
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:58.610
David Schaich (he): It' be some A. P. I. One of the words see negative expectation, value of the particle number coming from this.

122
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:05.080
David Schaich (he): they really about the grand canonical potential with respect to chemical, potentially.

123
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.020
David Schaich (he): So that is

124
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:15.030
David Schaich (he): the first and simplest relation between some. You derive all the use of interest and

125
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.270
potential.

126
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.370
David Schaich (he): The

127
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.550
David Schaich (he): temperature derivative is

128
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:35.090
David Schaich (he): similar to a bit more complicated, because now we have 2 terms. The first coming from the derivative of you have a share with respect to itself. Maybe just the one, said she, factor.

129
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.750
David Schaich (he): and then

130
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.300
David Schaich (he): temperature

131
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.570
David Schaich (he): That's not one of the

132
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.460
David Schaich (he): so for you Let's pull this off

133
00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.010
David Schaich (he): 2 separate

134
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.870
David Schaich (he): calculation. It is useful to

135
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:15.000
David Schaich (he): swap out the temperature derivative for the derivative. With respect to inverse temperature derivative. Of one over T. With respect to t

136
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.790
David Schaich (he): is minus one over 2 squared, which is minus Beta squared.

137
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:20.740
David Schaich (he): So this to really

138
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:27.760
David Schaich (he): itself it's minus square. The one gives us one over, he said. Gee! And then we have

139
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.270
David Schaich (he): same some of the microstates

140
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.070
David Schaich (he): as before. Now we, derivative with respect to data

141
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.620
David Schaich (he): and this

142
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:51.910
David Schaich (he): a negative sign. Times the combination of it. energy and particle number. The parentheses

143
00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.950
David Schaich (he): minus Beta squared out front

144
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:06.510
David Schaich (he): some of the Microsoft energies. We will still have the exponential factor in the

145
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.390
give us that probability. We solve all.

146
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:10.700
David Schaich (he): and then

147
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.930
David Schaich (he): it's tactic and parentheses on the chemical potential times

148
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.310
David Schaich (he): particle number. With that overall

149
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.000
David Schaich (he): negative sign

150
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.250
we plug this.

151
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.270
David Schaich (he): Thank you

152
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.290
David Schaich (he): for overall expression.

153
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.880
David Schaich (he): You have a negative for the G, which is just

154
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.780
David Schaich (he): the Grand Canonical potential.

155
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.080
David Schaich (he): I'm for sure

156
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.380
David Schaich (he): screen

157
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:58.410
David Schaich (he): and then a minus t factor times. Beta squared is one over t squared.

158
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:11.270
David Schaich (he): and the enumerated the expectation value with the energy minus times the expectation value of the particle number. We're putting everything

159
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.400
David Schaich (he): single expression.

160
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:22.770
David Schaich (he): the free energy minus internal energy. What the portable number.

161
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.980
David Schaich (he): the chemical potential to bring that to

162
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.430
David Schaich (he): units of energy

163
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.760
David Schaich (he): along with everything else in the single factor of the temperature

164
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.180
David Schaich (he): in the denominator.

165
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.690
David Schaich (he): So it relation between

166
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:43.570
David Schaich (he): for you the 4 quantities we have to work with the free energy, internal energy and particle number

167
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:50.450
David Schaich (he): all related to this derivative of the internal. I'm. Sorry the free energy

168
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.830
David Schaich (he): we can make this even more elegant than it already is by

169
00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.340
David Schaich (he): considering the last to live quality

170
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.020
David Schaich (he): in our list, to target the entropy.

171
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.630
David Schaich (he): and much as we did. you acknowledged the case.

172
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.100
David Schaich (he): you know, plug in

173
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:26.380
David Schaich (he): our Microsoft for the arguments to the algorithm and break up that single algorithm of their product into a some of for your algorithms.

174
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.100
David Schaich (he): So P: I was one over. Z. Do we have any

175
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:35.350
David Schaich (he): minus? One? Is a G. Multiply by the exponential of

176
00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.590
David Schaich (he): minus beta time.

177
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.010
David Schaich (he): the internal energy I

178
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.700
David Schaich (he): plus b the U,

179
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.760
David Schaich (he): I'm. And I

180
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:55.550
David Schaich (he): distributing that overall negative sign and carrying out some of the microstates.

181
00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.190
David Schaich (he): is independent of that, some

182
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.760
David Schaich (he): that just comes down, and we get some of her probabilities.

183
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:18.420
David Schaich (he): Yeah. you know 2 negative signs. I see internal energy, expectation, value, and similarly minus you

184
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:30.520
David Schaich (he): particle number, expectation, value. which we can recognize. His negative of the free energy.

185
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.260
David Schaich (he): most internal energy.

186
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.260
David Schaich (he): minus particle number. all with that Beta

187
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.270
David Schaich (he): getting a factor of one of the temperature. which is negative

188
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.750
David Schaich (he): of the free energy. That's

189
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.710
David Schaich (he): so. We now have relations between all 4.

190
00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:03.610
David Schaich (he): All of these we started off with the Grand Canonical potential entropy, internal energy and particle number which we can just collect.

191
00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:05.589
David Schaich (he): I see.

192
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.609
David Schaich (he): And this calculation here

193
00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:18.339
David Schaich (he): relations between the 2 partial derivatives of that

194
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:24.579
David Schaich (he): free energy, the pre economical potential with respect to out of their temperature or chemical potential.

195
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:26.420
the

196
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:35.450
David Schaich (he): an additional relation between the internal energy and the derivative of the logarithm of Zen G.

197
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.080
David Schaich (he): You found this a component

198
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.210
David Schaich (he): up to you.

199
00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.350
David Schaich (he): matter computation of the temperature derivative

200
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.140
just to pull things up.

201
00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.460
We can see you

202
00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:55.080
David Schaich (he): a factor of beta squared time. That expectation value of the energy

203
00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.440
David Schaich (he): minus mute times. Expectation. Value of a number so

204
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.220
David Schaich (he): rearranging, dividing by

205
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:13.400
David Schaich (he): beta squared is equivalent to multiplying by temperature squared. The arguments of

206
00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.470
David Schaich (he): derivative

207
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.840
David Schaich (he): is just the free energy divided by temperature with an overall negative silence.

208
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.630
David Schaich (he): Put out front

209
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:35.070
David Schaich (he): particle number, expectation down to the other side. So that is a another way of writing the relation between

210
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:37.440
I'm. Sure

211
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.010
David Schaich (he): internal.

212
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:47.560
David Schaich (he): similar to what we had in the economical case back when the particle on what was fixed.

213
00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:54.940
David Schaich (he): And finally, we have this relation between all 4 quantities.

214
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.250
David Schaich (he): Free energy

215
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.630
David Schaich (he): is equal to

216
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.890
David Schaich (he): the negative temperature times the entropy.

217
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:05.400
David Schaich (he): and then

218
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.520
David Schaich (he): moving the energy to the other side of the equation.

219
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.550
David Schaich (he): Yeah. bringing through that negative sign

220
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:20.200
David Schaich (he): gives us those other 2 factors

221
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.450
David Schaich (he): free energy to the internal energy and

222
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.140
David Schaich (he): political number.

223
00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.460
David Schaich (he): So these are

224
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:33.160
David Schaich (he): the useful set of relations that we will

225
00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:37.540
David Schaich (he): you, just to apply the grand canonical ensemble to autumn gases

226
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:51.130
David Schaich (he): and extract the large scale behavior from the underlying microstates that we have yet to derive for those particular systems. Are there any questions?

227
00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.440
David Schaich (he): Yeah, what we use going through to get from the grand canonical thing

228
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:56.460
function

229
00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:04.080
David Schaich (he): to all these relations between the microscopic quantities of our economical systems.

230
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:24.700
David Schaich (he): There's one more thing to say about you relations between them

231
00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:33.530
David Schaich (he): which is now to further generalize the first law of thermodynamics to the

232
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.290
it's allowed to fluctuate.

233
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:36.550
David Schaich (he): So

234
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.660
David Schaich (he): if we recall. we started all many weeks ago.

235
00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:58.140
David Schaich (he): like the first law of thermodynamics was simply a conservation of energy and fancy terminology for that hopefully familiar concept. And then.

236
00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:05.410
David Schaich (he): when we moved from the micro canonical ensemble that implemented the conservation of energy directly

237
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:15.800
David Schaich (he): to the canonical ensemble that allowed the internal energy to actually, by exchanging heats or doing work on the environment to our system.

238
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.970
David Schaich (he): ended up generalizing the first of all, 2

239
00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.340
David Schaich (he): case number 5,

240
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:31.140
David Schaich (he): just for slightly more compact notation. Only both the expectation values. And just remember that

241
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.940
David Schaich (he): Yeah, internal energy is

242
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.060
David Schaich (he): the fluctuating quality.

243
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:45.920
David Schaich (he): It's the expectation value that is. we'll define it as a function of

244
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:56.280
David Schaich (he): temperature and particle number of the canonical case. We generalize the first law to this relation the internal energy is allowed to change.

245
00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:00.420
David Schaich (he): but only by exchanging either he

246
00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:10.950
David Schaich (he): temperature times. a change in entropy with the environment. or by having work done on it. We're doing work on this environment. You can see a personal work, theme

247
00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.710
David Schaich (he): the Pressure Times. Any change in the volume of the system.

248
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.810
David Schaich (he): So. keeping this

249
00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.310
David Schaich (he): set up of he

250
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:35.050
David Schaich (he): system in a volume V. And returning to the Grand Canonical case. we still have these possible ways of exchanging energy with the external particle reservoir by the through heat or work.

251
00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.420
David Schaich (he): And

252
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.030
David Schaich (he): now we have the additional possibility.

253
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.250
David Schaich (he): there being a change.

254
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.440
part of it.

255
00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:46.630
David Schaich (he): Number

256
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.720
David Schaich (he): which was not allowed in the canonical framework.

257
00:22:52.110 --> 00:23:03.220
David Schaich (he): So if we consider the entropy as a function of internal energy. volume and particle number, the 3 control parameters that we've

258
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:04.060
have

259
00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.740
David Schaich (he): a generic grand canonical system

260
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.560
for you.

261
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:09.000
David Schaich (he): I can

262
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.870
David Schaich (he): expand, and you change the entropy.

263
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:20.030
David Schaich (he): Yes. some partial where it is with respect to each of those 3 control parameters.

264
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.140
David Schaich (he): 2 or 8 this year for you.

265
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.440
This.

266
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:36.270
David Schaich (he): and also

267
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.210
David Schaich (he): particle number

268
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:43.640
David Schaich (he): we can

269
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:53.140
David Schaich (he): recognize. I'm, all the way back in I'm. Working on the the change in entropy

270
00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.320
number

271
00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.500
David Schaich (he): is that inverse temperature?

272
00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:06.270
David Schaich (he): You, Don't? You have an interpretation of the

273
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:12.680
David Schaich (he): change in the interview with respect to volume, but we also saw just last week.

274
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:20.390
David Schaich (he): at the analogous response to the entropy to a change. A particle number with fixed energy is the

275
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:34.790
David Schaich (he): actually negative chemical potential divided by it. The temperature you went through. Why, that negative sign is there. And yeah, chemical, potential and temperature have

276
00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.410
David Schaich (he): the same units that cancel

277
00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:38.890
David Schaich (he): in this expression.

278
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:52.680
David Schaich (he): So if we focus now on the partial derivative that's like UN evaluated here certain guests. this is this is going to come out to be related to the pressure

279
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:57.050
David Schaich (he): which we can confirm. Thanks to the fact that we fixed the

280
00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.090
David Schaich (he): particle number and the energy

281
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:06.420
David Schaich (he): in this partial, derivative What do you fixed particle number

282
00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:09.660
David Schaich (he): allows us to go back to

283
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.210
David Schaich (he): everything we've

284
00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:18.720
David Schaich (he): derive and work through for the I don't like the ensemble. We consider this partial. And

285
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.910
David Schaich (he): yeah. then we need a snaps.

286
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:30.680
David Schaich (he): The change in the that. We have an economical case given by it. This

287
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:41.020
David Schaich (he): previous generalization of the first law of thermodynamics. Tds minus P. TV, he is

288
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:45.740
David Schaich (he): vanishing for the energy to be fixed, so rearranging this

289
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:46.990
David Schaich (he): consume later.

290
00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.330
David Schaich (he): That

291
00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.970
David Schaich (he): is the ratio on the other side of that equality.

292
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.820
David Schaich (he): So the

293
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:12.010
David Schaich (he): general generalization of the first law of thermodynamics which it's sometimes called. Do you

294
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.830
David Schaich (he): generalized?

295
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:36.340
David Schaich (he): Yeah. the late essentially all of the control parameters at our disposal for your grand canonical system. We rearrange this expansion of the change, the energy multiplying through by

296
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:41.470
David Schaich (he): the temperature that appears in every one of these 3 terms. I'm. Giving you

297
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.370
the same form as the generalized person. On the

298
00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.520
David Schaich (he): In the canonical case

299
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:52.830
David Schaich (he): we have again a temperature of times change in entropy.

300
00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:58.840
David Schaich (he): Pdv. Except a negative sign, and from going on the other side of the equations.

301
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.350
David Schaich (he): and then negative

302
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.690
David Schaich (he): sign on with the chemical potential.

303
00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:21.680
David Schaich (he): And we have a third term that was not possible in the canonical case. but the change in energy is given by it. Temperature, change and entropy. Yeah. minus pressure, time, changing volume plus chemical potential

304
00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.820
David Schaich (he): change the particle number.

305
00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:31.340
David Schaich (he): and this is some. This is final third term.

306
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.480
David Schaich (he): It's referred to as

307
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:40.740
David Schaich (he): the chemical work in analogy to the chemical work, that

308
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.080
to

309
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.830
David Schaich (he): the volume changing that they given pressure

310
00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.870
David Schaich (he): the idea of being that

311
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:55.130
David Schaich (he): a change in particle number particle slowing into our out of the system effectively. It does some work

312
00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:08.270
David Schaich (he): the system with surroundings based on how much energy. How are you? By each of those particles that are flowing into an out of the system. Yeah.

313
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:13.340
David Schaich (he): amount of energy is given by this chemical potential.

314
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:27.850
David Schaich (he): And that may not. The obvious just based on what we've discussed about the chemical potential previously is related to change in entropy. With respect to a change in particle number.

315
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:32.120
David Schaich (he): we can actually extract that from this generalized term of the name.

316
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:33.620
Let me see this

317
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:36.650
David Schaich (he): info.

318
00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:45.620
David Schaich (he): all wrapped up in a compact form in this expression

319
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:52.600
David Schaich (he): extract by simplifying this relation of seeing

320
00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:54.580
David Schaich (he): what comes out of it. So

321
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.380
David Schaich (he): how's it? You

322
00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:59.440
David Schaich (he): 3, for example.

323
00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:03.570
David Schaich (he): fixing the particular number.

324
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:06.060
The volume of the system

325
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:12.220
David Schaich (he): we have at the change in energy is given by just

326
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:26.680
David Schaich (he): T. Times. The change in entropy. the other 2 terms vanish and rearranging this. you calling me one over temperature given by the differential factor of

327
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:29.780
David Schaich (he): entropy in respect to energy

328
00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:37.570
David Schaich (he): right here that the particle, number and volume is fixed which gets us back to

329
00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.570
David Schaich (he): the

330
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.650
micro economical definition of the temperature.

331
00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.870
David Schaich (he): Yeah, we you

332
00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:50.820
David Schaich (he): so many weeks ago and confirmed obes, our physical intuition about heat exchange.

333
00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:51.660
David Schaich (he): and

334
00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.770
David Schaich (he): how the temperature of 2 objects.

335
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.490
David Schaich (he): I better put it to the thermal contact approach.

336
00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.790
Yeah. Sensible temperature in between with you.

337
00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.260
David Schaich (he): So that is

338
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:12.010
David Schaich (he): a send me check that in general.

339
00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.610
David Schaich (he): some of the way we fix

340
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.340
David Schaich (he): another pair of

341
00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:28.560
David Schaich (he): the differential actors in this equation. So in and the entropy.

342
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.270
David Schaich (he): all that is left is that the

343
00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:33.580
David Schaich (he): change in energy is

344
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:40.890
David Schaich (he): the mechanical order minus pressure times. The change in volume and rearranging gives us

345
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.370
David Schaich (he): the definition of the pressure

346
00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.560
David Schaich (he): as a change in energy. With respect to boarding.

347
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:53.920
David Schaich (he): with fixed entropy and particle number.

348
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.500
David Schaich (he): which is precisely the

349
00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:58.470
David Schaich (he): definition that we you

350
00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.310
David Schaich (he): started off with when introducing them.

351
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:08.310
David Schaich (he): The pressure itself and the volume of of an ideal gas as a control parameter

352
00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:12.790
David Schaich (he): in the canonical ensemble that fixes, and by definition.

353
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:19.980
David Schaich (he): yeah. fixed entropy condition was at that point something that

354
00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:22.900
David Schaich (he): we just had to declare.

355
00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:27.320
David Schaich (he): And this is showing how. from the general.

356
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:35.650
David Schaich (he): Why is this as a condition of extracting that pressure from the more general expression?

357
00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.900
David Schaich (he): And there are several other

358
00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.070
David Schaich (he): relations that we can get by choosing any 2 of these.

359
00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:49.870
David Schaich (he): for if it accessible factors to to manage fixing the corresponding qualities.

360
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:52.180
David Schaich (he): just do one more to

361
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.380
David Schaich (he): you. Get a You look at that chemical potential which will

362
00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:01.300
David Schaich (he): elaborate on

363
00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:10.610
David Schaich (he): what I was just saying before this exercise of fixing the entropy and the volume your left

364
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.310
David Schaich (he): any change in energy being

365
00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:22.400
David Schaich (he): Oops chemical potential times to change the number of particles. What we do.

366
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:31.680
David Schaich (he): an alternative expression for the chemical, potentially, not as a response of the entropy to change a part of that.

367
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.950
David Schaich (he): the energy fix as the change in energy into a change of

368
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.720
okay.

369
00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.570
David Schaich (he): the fixed entropy

370
00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.500
David Schaich (he): in a fixed volume.

371
00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:49.470
David Schaich (he): So this. in access to the idea.

372
00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:54.830
David Schaich (he): This you, the intern and the thermodynamic identity, is

373
00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:56.850
David Schaich (he): doing work.

374
00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:03.480
David Schaich (he): It is the amount of energy that has to change in a system.

375
00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:08.240
David Schaich (he): given a change in the particle number such that the entropy

376
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.710
David Schaich (he): remains fixed.

377
00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.690
and from

378
00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.290
David Schaich (he): what we went through

379
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.830
David Schaich (he): last week, just when introducing the chemical potential

380
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:24.960
David Schaich (he): in its alternative form as a change of the entropy with fixed energy. Rather than this other way around.

381
00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:32.800
David Schaich (he): we part of you pass. hey? Increase in the number of particles keeping it

382
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.670
David Schaich (he): energy fixed.

383
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:45.430
David Schaich (he): We can see also from that thermodynamic idea that it would give us back to the usual relation between

384
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:51.800
David Schaich (he): chemical potential and the derivative of entropy. With respect to particle number.

385
00:33:52.620 --> 00:34:06.520
David Schaich (he): All you've had is some exercise for you just to check. We argue that. and natural systems with positive temperature number of microstates that

386
00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:16.739
David Schaich (he): is accessible with a large number of particles, even with fixed energy it is always going to increase when the number of particles increases.

387
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.949
David Schaich (he): So if we. what to keep the

388
00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:33.469
David Schaich (he): entropy fixed when looking at the response of the energy to a change in particle number.

389
00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:35.679
David Schaich (he): this means that we have to

390
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:41.940
David Schaich (he): compensate for this increase in the entropy and for natural systems with

391
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.730
David Schaich (he): positive temperature.

392
00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:54.130
David Schaich (he): since the temperature is the response of the entropy to a change in the energy up there. It supplies that the

393
00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:57.260
David Schaich (he): internal energy has to be reduced

394
00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:09.900
David Schaich (he): in order to keep the entropy fixed. In this relation. the canonical potential again for natural systems with a positive temperature.

395
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.720
David Schaich (he): So what we have is

396
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:21.540
David Schaich (he): a decrease in the energy caused by an increase in the particle number in order to keep that interview. Fix

397
00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.100
David Schaich (he): which means that on you

398
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:28.080
David Schaich (he): it's going to be a negative number

399
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.680
David Schaich (he): to you. It's partial. Derivative

400
00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:36.770
David Schaich (he): used to be less than 0 in order to be consistent with the condition of

401
00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.520
David Schaich (he): house in entropy.

402
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:41.980
David Schaich (he): This is assuming

403
00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:49.070
David Schaich (he): natural systems, where increasing energy, your increasing particle

404
00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:54.570
David Schaich (he): both lead to an increase in the entropy.

405
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:56.690
David Schaich (he): and this, of course, is.

406
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.280
David Schaich (he): and we started off after wrapping up the dynamic cycles, we introduced the chemical potential

407
00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:07.250
David Schaich (he): from It's all part of the form. the negative

408
00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:17.090
David Schaich (he): partial derivative of entropy with respect to particle number. I didn't but bye bye. yeah temperature. And we saw that

409
00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.420
David Schaich (he): this was

410
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:22.210
David Schaich (he): generically negative, so that

411
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:28.500
David Schaich (he): and 2 canonical systems are brought into contact with each other, particles will flow

412
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:32.420
David Schaich (he): for the one that the larger chemical potential, the less negative

413
00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:38.240
David Schaich (he): you to the one with the lower chemical potential, just as keep those from

414
00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:42.000
David Schaich (he): larger temperatures to smaller temperatures.

415
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.750
David Schaich (he): And all of this is now coming from

416
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.060
David Schaich (he): apparently simple one line

417
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:54.520
David Schaich (he): relation to generalize something like identity that connects

418
00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:59.750
of the large scale thermodynamic properties that we have introduced.

419
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:08.070
David Schaich (he): and another way. It gives us another way to make sense of the chemical potential as effectively the unit of

420
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.830
David Schaich (he): work. For me.

421
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.680
the energy exchange

422
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:14.600
David Schaich (he): for a given exchange of particles

423
00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:18.270
David Schaich (he): between the system and it's external particle reservoir.

424
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.840
David Schaich (he): and that is

425
00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:23.730
David Schaich (he): there you

426
00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.190
David Schaich (he): last from the German generic.

427
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.680
David Schaich (he): They have one to say about. I mean

428
00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.200
David Schaich (he): ensemble just at the foundational level

429
00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.720
David Schaich (he): will now change, tax slightly and

430
00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:45.660
David Schaich (he): begin building up to applications of your economic ensemble to

431
00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.140
David Schaich (he): ideal gases and specifically

432
00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.570
David Schaich (he): ideal quantum gases. So I will

433
00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:55.200
David Schaich (he): just pause briefly here and make sure that we're happy with

434
00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.830
David Schaich (he): all of these foundations and

435
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:03.900
David Schaich (he): relations we've been able to derive physical meeting of them all.

436
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:26.290
David Schaich (he): It seems to be the case.

437
00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:34.370
David Schaich (he): So we have a few minutes before taking a brief break

438
00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.610
David Schaich (he): 1 h to the next.

439
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.610
David Schaich (he): which will give us time at least to

440
00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:48.910
David Schaich (he): motivate or recall previously

441
00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:49.730
the

442
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.300
David Schaich (he): context of it. awesome statistics.

443
00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.480
David Schaich (he): and again

444
00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.080
David Schaich (he): introducing at least some of the

445
00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:13.070
David Schaich (he): concepts of of the physics in such a way that she any we functions or awesome stuff like that before, in order to make sense of the

446
00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.360
David Schaich (he): or scale statistical behavior that comes out of them.

447
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:20.250
David Schaich (he): So

448
00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:29.140
David Schaich (he): in good place to start. You know the microphone is beeping because it wasn't like been over the weekend, so

449
00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:33.100
David Schaich (he): you'll see if it holds up for next few minutes.

450
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.850
David Schaich (he): We recall when we introduced ideal gases.

451
00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.360
David Schaich (he): we had to

452
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:46.070
David Schaich (he): regulate the partition function

453
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:51.240
David Schaich (he): by

454
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.020
David Schaich (he): imposing an ons that

455
00:39:56.010 --> 00:40:06.180
David Schaich (he): only a certain countable number of discrete values for the particle momenta, and therefore the particle energy. Well, that

456
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:11.040
David Schaich (he): the

457
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:19.160
David Schaich (he): discreet moments of that defined. he said, I

458
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:21.720
David Schaich (he): energy levels.

459
00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.800
David Schaich (he): And in that context

460
00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.170
David Schaich (he): we were able to argue that by assuming

461
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:42.780
David Schaich (he): classical, nominalistic ideal gases for which the plant costs that appeared in the discrete momentum. it's very small compared to

462
00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:45.260
combination of

463
00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:49.380
David Schaich (he): system science. It's a linear extent l in space

464
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.420
David Schaich (he): and the square root of the mass of the particles in your temperature

465
00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:00.780
David Schaich (he): you were able to turn the resulting some over microstates into

466
00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:04.710
David Schaich (he): and well-defined integral

467
00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:13.040
David Schaich (he): over continuously varying values for those energies.

468
00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.950
David Schaich (he): The first step 2 more.

469
00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:18.870
David Schaich (he): What we call some statistics is to

470
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:24.010
David Schaich (he): retaining the discrete energy levels

471
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:28.980
David Schaich (he): that we briefly introduced

472
00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:35.520
David Schaich (he): a few weeks ago in that classical context. But we will see, yeah.

473
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.910
David Schaich (he): And I think we will get through all this today that

474
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:44.340
David Schaich (he): this is a necessary but not sufficient condition to

475
00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.780
David Schaich (he): get us from classical or non quantum

476
00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:52.360
David Schaich (he): statistics part of the way to quantum physics, but not all the way.

477
00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.090
David Schaich (he): So what this will do

478
00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.450
David Schaich (he): give us a

479
00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:12.720
David Schaich (he): classical set of statistics. Remember that classical is they sitting in for non- and the particular statistics that the wheel

480
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:18.340
David Schaich (he): results from a classical treatment of discrete energy levels is

481
00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.140
David Schaich (he): known as

482
00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:24.980
David Schaich (he): Maxwell

483
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:35.680
David Schaich (he): Distribution. where Maxwell is the same Maxwell as the Demon. We talked about briefly last Thursday

484
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.100
David Schaich (he): first day of the Char.

485
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.980
David Schaich (he): I just want to be founders of

486
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:51.690
David Schaich (he): statistical physics, both working in the 1,800 as well before anyone here any idea that nature was fundamentally quantum.

487
00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:55.790
David Schaich (he): But it will be useful to derive

488
00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:59.880
David Schaich (he): this classical set of statistics, because that will

489
00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:01.950
David Schaich (he): also reveal

490
00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:10.880
David Schaich (he): what is needed for true quantum statistics.

491
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:19.660
David Schaich (he): Google

492
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:30.160
David Schaich (he): see an issue in our derivation. Yeah, addressing which will

493
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:38.390
David Schaich (he): promot those from that classical statistics with discrete energy levels to a truly positive setup, and I should reiterate that

494
00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:50.130
David Schaich (he): not going to go through any proofs or demonstrations that quantum mechanics that we get is

495
00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:56.670
David Schaich (he): surely one is realized in nature that essentially will be an ons for us to work with.

496
00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:04.020
David Schaich (he): that you will be able to look at some experimental data later this week or after the term break

497
00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.150
David Schaich (he): that demonstrates

498
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:07.430
David Schaich (he): that's

499
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:10.700
David Schaich (he): This gives a good description of

500
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:14.740
David Schaich (he): a wide range of physical phenomena. but

501
00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:26.050
David Schaich (he): that will be the second step. Our first step is to derive classical max levels and statistics, and you simplify doing so.

502
00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:29.100
David Schaich (he): So we are retaining discrete energy levels.

503
00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:33.170
David Schaich (he): You want to express everything

504
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:37.480
David Schaich (he): in terms of those, so we will

505
00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.600
David Schaich (he): introduce a convenient label for them.

506
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:50.580
David Schaich (he): We'll call each energy level as a whole the script e. The subscript and for level.

507
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:55.120
David Schaich (he): and we will see that this energy level E of L

508
00:44:56.150 --> 00:45:01.400
David Schaich (he): has a value of the energy. Excuse me, bye. in normal.

509
00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.920
David Schaich (he): subscript out.

510
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:11.800
David Schaich (he): and we will see it is possible to have energy levels

511
00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:22.560
David Schaich (he): that are distinguished by properties other than the value of the energy that they have. So it is

512
00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:30.030
David Schaich (he): entirely possible, and Indeed, we have already seen the example. We are yeah

513
00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.470
David Schaich (he): value of the energy for

514
00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:37.880
David Schaich (he): 2 different energy levels use the same

515
00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.290
David Schaich (he): even for

516
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:54.040
David Schaich (he): sync energy levels. E. M. And E. N. With M. I. Equal to n

517
00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.800
David Schaich (he): an example that we saw was

518
00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:02.840
David Schaich (he): for a single classical non-relativistic particle

519
00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.280
David Schaich (he): momentum.

520
00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:09.520
David Schaich (he): It's one units. I'm not

521
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:13.180
David Schaich (he): h bar pi over l in the X direction

522
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.950
David Schaich (he): she couldn't

523
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.700
yeah

524
00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:22.270
David Schaich (he): units there. That that could be the energy level. and

525
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:24.400
David Schaich (he): the l could be

526
00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.550
David Schaich (he): that same units

527
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:31.710
David Schaich (he): is that direction. We can easily distinguish a particle

528
00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:35.710
David Schaich (he): going in the X direction from then going in the Z direction.

529
00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:43.990
David Schaich (he): But the energies that depend on the inner product. e squared or identical for those 2 different energy levels.

530
00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:49.370
David Schaich (he): So we'll say the situation

531
00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:55.140
David Schaich (he): gives us degenerate energy levels. So some number

532
00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:07.150
David Schaich (he): of energy levels are degenerate if they have the same value of the energy otherwise distinguishable. And we go label

533
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:08.980
David Schaich (he): all of our energy levels

534
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:19.300
David Schaich (he): this labeling. You have the freedom to sort the energy well is. so that

535
00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:24.530
David Schaich (he): the values of the energies themselves increase.

536
00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:31.200
David Schaich (he): As your subscripts increase. So as we go from a smaller label.

537
00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:36.550
David Schaich (he): e sub m to a larger label. You sub n. We get to

538
00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:40.810
David Schaich (he): larger, or at least non decreasing values of the energy itself.

539
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:42.950
David Schaich (he): and without

540
00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:48.740
David Schaich (he): assume that the smallest energy misleading

541
00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:53.260
David Schaich (he): e sub 0 for that ground state that we've seen before

542
00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:56.030
David Schaich (he): is a non-negative

543
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:59.340
David Schaich (he): energy.

544
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:04.610
David Schaich (he): This is something that we are free to

545
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:10.020
David Schaich (he): impose just by shifting our overall definition of the 0 points of the energy

546
00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.740
David Schaich (he): without any loss of generality.

547
00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:23.410
David Schaich (he): So based on this labeling of energy levels, the next step is to

548
00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:28.630
David Schaich (he): compute the generic grand canonical partition function that we have now

549
00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:31.990
David Schaich (he): introduced and related to large scale

550
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:37.240
David Schaich (he): up zoom rules of interest and given the time.

551
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:42.690
David Schaich (he): Let you take a quick break, and we will come back and dive into that

552
00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:55.680
David Schaich (he): or complicated derivation of partition function based on discrete countable energy levels at the top of the hour at 10. Unless there are

553
00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:57.340
David Schaich (he): immediate questions.

554
00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:03.620
David Schaich (he): I'll plug this guy back in and see how long it lasts in the

555
00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.200
David Schaich (he): second half of this morning.

556
00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:16.320
David Schaich (he): Okay, that should be the recording that zoom and

557
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:30.350
David Schaich (he): assuming no questions, have risen during that break charge on the head as promised to compute the grand canonical partition functions of summing over all

558
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:35.510
David Schaich (he): microstates in terms of

559
00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:38.100
David Schaich (he): the

560
00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:43.450
David Schaich (he): energy levels with the discreet and as yet unspecified value of the energy.

561
00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:46.980
David Schaich (he): So what we can do to

562
00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:48.500
David Schaich (he): make this

563
00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:51.470
David Schaich (he): to organize this.

564
00:49:54.140 --> 00:50:04.960
David Schaich (he): it's a range all the Microsoft to some over in terms of the number of particles that they involved.

565
00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:13.790
David Schaich (he): bye the contributions to the grand canonical partition function.

566
00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.300
which is that

567
00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:22.240
David Schaich (he): some over all microstates or generalized it's the fact that it depends on

568
00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:25.910
David Schaich (he): internal energy and particle number.

569
00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:28.390
David Schaich (he): Okay.

570
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:33.120
David Schaich (he): begin by first, considering the subset of microstates that

571
00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:38.390
David Schaich (he): don't you go any particles. it's kind of trivial case.

572
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:45.290
David Schaich (he): Usually, if there are no particles. You will declare there will be no energies in this back. It will just be a single one.

573
00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:53.590
David Schaich (he): Things get more interesting when you have the next of all the Microsoft, in which there is a single particle.

574
00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:56.870
David Schaich (he): This has

575
00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:04.080
David Schaich (he): the single particle energies minus a single factor of the chemical potential.

576
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:13.700
David Schaich (he): With 2 particles. We have the topsy energy minus 2 new.

577
00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:21.330
David Schaich (he): and then so on, for all possible number of particles that our system can have.

578
00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:25.010
David Schaich (he): This is useful if we

579
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:37.940
David Schaich (he): so label this. Your trivial case is a 0 particle canonical partition function. and we can similarly, for

580
00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:46.150
David Schaich (he): the sums over and larger numbers of particles. all that all of the dependence on the chemical potential particle numbers. So here we have

581
00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:51.220
David Schaich (he): the role factor in the possibly you

582
00:51:52.550 --> 00:52:03.720
David Schaich (he): and then just do some over the Bolton factor, either the minus beta times energy for all single particle energy levels.

583
00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.550
David Schaich (he): which

584
00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:09.950
David Schaich (he): is just the single particle canonical partition function.

585
00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:14.100
David Schaich (he): How are you worked with quite a bit the context of

586
00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:20.490
David Schaich (he): spin systems, and similarly. you will pick up 2 factors.

587
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:26.510
David Schaich (he): a pre-factor to a 2 particle canonical partition function.

588
00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:27.820
David Schaich (he): and so on

589
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:42.370
David Schaich (he): which, in general. we can write as a sum over the number of particles in It's fluctuating in a great economical system. But fix each individual term

590
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:50.180
David Schaich (he): we're considering systematically. Okay. E to the n value or equivalent

591
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.810
to be

592
00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:53.290
David Schaich (he): the power in

593
00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.700
David Schaich (he): multiplied by the in political canonical.

594
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:59.190
David Schaich (he): efficient functions at some end.

595
00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:11.150
David Schaich (he): This relation between the

596
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:17.970
David Schaich (he): we economical ensemble and an infinite sum of canonical partition functions

597
00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:23.910
David Schaich (he): is known as the fugacity Expansion. Where this exponential factor

598
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:32.190
David Schaich (he): is what it's called the you sometimes use

599
00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:37.070
David Schaich (he): you to the

600
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.930
David Schaich (he): E to the chemical potential divided by temperature.

601
00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:53.170
David Schaich (he): And this is useful in part because we have it already. A lot of experience with canonical permission functions that we can now

602
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:56.860
David Schaich (he): uses a basis for grand canonical analyses

603
00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:00.900
David Schaich (he): in particular for

604
00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:07.630
David Schaich (he): ideal systems. the degrees of freedom going on it directed.

605
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:15.540
David Schaich (he): If we consider you seem like, it will probably be in particle efficient function. It's just

606
00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:20.850
David Schaich (he): and factors of the single particle partition function

607
00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:24.500
David Schaich (he): and moving to

608
00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.120
to be.

609
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:32.350
David Schaich (he): which is relevant for quantum physics. something that we can take

610
00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:36.780
David Schaich (he): rather than something we will from rigorously here, that just brings in

611
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:43.460
David Schaich (he): this one over n factorial factor. that correct for

612
00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:57.500
David Schaich (he): over counting of all the different possible labelings, there cannot be all the part in the case. Oh. indistinguishable particles!

613
00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:05.690
David Schaich (he): How we are

614
00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:09.560
David Schaich (he): correcting or

615
00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.510
David Schaich (he): over counting the possible microstates

616
00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:19.760
distinguishable particles.

617
00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.520
David Schaich (he): So plenty this in

618
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:33.870
David Schaich (he): yeah pleasant expression for the free economical partition function. some over all

619
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:41.640
David Schaich (he): possible numbers of particles. hey, one over and factorial

620
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:47.060
David Schaich (he): z one to the power in the

621
00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.350
David Schaich (he): By it

622
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:58.340
David Schaich (he): I want to an overall factor of the power end. and we can recognize the infinite zone of.

623
00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:04.760
David Schaich (he): say, X. This quantity in parentheses raise the power in with each term the way to

624
00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:11.420
David Schaich (he): one over end factorial. That's the power series with the exponential function.

625
00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:15.070
David Schaich (he): the

626
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:18.210
David Schaich (he): Times, the single particle partition function.

627
00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:24.260
David Schaich (he): So this is the Maxwell Boltzmann.

628
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:30.060
David Schaich (he): We economical partition function in generic terms. The

629
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.850
David Schaich (he): final step is to

630
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:41.250
David Schaich (he): puts the single particle partition function in terms of the discrete energy levels

631
00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:42.950
to work with.

632
00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:47.760
David Schaich (he): which is easy, because there's only a single particle.

633
00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:52.510
David Schaich (he): Yes. single particle to Canada occupy

634
00:56:53.800 --> 00:57:00.930
David Schaich (he): anyone of the possible energy levels in turn. So

635
00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:07.460
David Schaich (he): most it has chosen the energy level to occupy

636
00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:11.170
David Schaich (he): that completely defines the

637
00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:17.580
David Schaich (he): microstates. There are no other particles to put in any other energy levels. Every energy level

638
00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:21.120
David Schaich (he): can be occupied once per microstate

639
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:29.070
David Schaich (he): to the some of the microstates for a single article. This produces to the sum over energy levels.

640
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:40.190
David Schaich (he): Lower his L. We'll see that there are capital L, so one energy levels where. because i'll take 4 min out of

641
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.560
and a few levels

642
00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.090
David Schaich (he): to be working with.

643
00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:50.750
David Schaich (he): But when the energy is in sorry when the particle is an energy level

644
00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:54.310
David Schaich (he): script, e sub l with energy e to l

645
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:57.660
David Schaich (he): It's economical condition function

646
00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:09.080
David Schaich (he): picks up only yeah. both. In fact, your the exponential minus beta times, the corresponding energy or that energy level.

647
00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:12.130
David Schaich (he): And this gives us

648
00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:20.230
David Schaich (he): partition function that the phones

649
00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:26.230
David Schaich (he): Maxwell postman distribution of maximum statistics

650
00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:33.170
David Schaich (he): plugging this sum into the exponential.

651
00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:38.650
David Schaich (he): we can pull out

652
00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:45.800
David Schaich (he): overall factory that the the the

653
00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:50.020
David Schaich (he): on the energy and some over the energy levels.

654
00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:57.970
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Boltzmann factor for each energy level and then rearrange

655
00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:06.820
David Schaich (he): the exponential factors to pull out to you some getting something that

656
00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:10.910
David Schaich (he): looks a little bit more like the

657
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:16.830
David Schaich (he): exponential factor that appears in the grand canonical partition function itself

658
00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:30.060
David Schaich (he): that we can't an exponential of the sum to a product of explanations. the exponential, the exponential minus P. That times he, l

659
00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:35.420
David Schaich (he): minus mute. taking the product over all of the energy levels.

660
00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:37.420
David Schaich (he): So

661
00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:41.390
David Schaich (he): this defines maximum statistics

662
00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:48.550
David Schaich (he): which has these discrete energy levels. L. My canonical position function is the products of exponential

663
00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:50.310
of exponentials

664
00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:57.270
David Schaich (he): or each energy level with the chemical potential.

665
00:59:58.410 --> 00:59:59.670
David Schaich (he): I mean you

666
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:06.310
David Schaich (he): to counteract the energy out of each energy level.

667
01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:22.010
David Schaich (he): And I made your earlier. That's despite the this could find as energy levels or quantize energy levels. This is not a true quantum result.

668
01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.650
David Schaich (he): but actually classical physics

669
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.080
David Schaich (he): that's

670
01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:35.940
David Schaich (he): simply involves a countable number of energy levels. which, of course, is how maximum Boltzmann would have

671
01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:39.200
David Schaich (he): understood that this sort of thing back in the 18 hundreds.

672
01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:52.420
David Schaich (he): What is means is that in our derivation of the Maxwell has been granted a partition function. There was some assumption of classical or nonprofit physics

673
01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.240
David Schaich (he): that was

674
01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:04.130
David Schaich (he): in one step that seems sensible to to all of you. No one objected to it. You trust me.

675
01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.750
David Schaich (he): They they claim that turns out to why, on

676
01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.110
David Schaich (he): and assumption of the classical physics.

677
01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:19.650
David Schaich (he): and i'll tell you what we assumed.

678
01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:28.050
David Schaich (he): which, without saying so, so there was a hidden assumption that every one of the in the

679
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:32.210
David Schaich (he): was in a different energy level.

680
01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:43.160
David Schaich (he): I did not make this claim explicitly. It was hidden

681
01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.430
David Schaich (he): in the

682
01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:49.150
David Schaich (he): and particle canonical, proficient function

683
01:01:51.090 --> 01:01:52.480
David Schaich (he): that we worked with

684
01:01:52.520 --> 01:02:01.750
David Schaich (he): as and powers of the single particle proficient function with this one over n factorial factor to correct for the over counting

685
01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:06.970
David Schaich (he): of the labeling that we do not have with indistinguishable particles.

686
01:02:09.090 --> 01:02:10.430
David Schaich (he): So we can

687
01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.240
David Schaich (he): see how

688
01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.120
David Schaich (he): this breaks down, depending on

689
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:25.510
David Schaich (he): what energy levels the particle is occupied just by considering a simple case. We are

690
01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.940
David Schaich (he): there are

691
01:02:28.070 --> 01:02:32.020
David Schaich (he): just 2 particles and see a small number of energy levels

692
01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:36.360
David Schaich (he): within to occupy. So we will go through absolutely

693
01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:41.420
David Schaich (he): full detail. The 2 particle partition function

694
01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:58.160
David Schaich (he): with L. A. Plus 4, and the sum over energy levels. So there are our total with 5 energy levels to consider from E. 0 up to V. 4, and you will see that all 5

695
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:03.670
David Schaich (he): how these energy levels are degenerate. So they all have it

696
01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:08.440
David Schaich (he): an energy equal to 0. That is.

697
01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:21.350
David Schaich (he): it'd be me to do, because then our single particle proficient function that some from 0 to 4 E to the minus beta times

698
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:27.610
David Schaich (he): That's just the sum over all of one

699
01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.700
David Schaich (he): which just counts

700
01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:45.100
David Schaich (he): the number of microstates in particular. This generalizes the end particle partition function with all these energy is equal to 0. Similarly, accounts all of the

701
01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:53.030
David Schaich (he): possible microstates with n particles. So this is the same mathematics.

702
01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.250
It is

703
01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:00.200
David Schaich (he): counting the number of ways to

704
01:04:01.930 --> 01:04:04.180
David Schaich (he): place in

705
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:07.890
David Schaich (he): L 1 1 5 boxes.

706
01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:16.630
David Schaich (he): So specifically we have

707
01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.930
David Schaich (he): screen.

708
01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:29.780
David Schaich (he): we can picture. This is 5 energy levels in a row.

709
01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.760
David Schaich (he): We have

710
01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:36.820
David Schaich (he): 2 particles to a place within them. You could

711
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:42.610
David Schaich (he): please those 2 particles in 2 different energy levels.

712
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:46.020
David Schaich (he): for it is also possible to

713
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:51.090
David Schaich (he): place both of them the State energy level.

714
01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:58.340
David Schaich (he): And then we will simply have that energy level account the twice in the

715
01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:03.640
David Schaich (he): contribution to the grand canonical partition function coming from this particular

716
01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:04.830
David Schaich (he): micro-states

717
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:08.200
David Schaich (he): so

718
01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.690
David Schaich (he): next page.

719
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:16.470
David Schaich (he): It's make sure that this setup is clear.

720
01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:18.560
David Schaich (he): So.

721
01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.990
David Schaich (he): looking at first the

722
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.310
David Schaich (he): case where all where both of these 2 particles are distinguishable.

723
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:31.820
David Schaich (he): Yes.

724
01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:37.160
David Schaich (he): let me ask you how many microstates. they all right, so

725
01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:39.400
the 2 particles

726
01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:45.890
David Schaich (he): be distinguishable.

727
01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:48.230
David Schaich (he): This will not be the

728
01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:55.170
David Schaich (he): He's in awesome statistics, but so perfectly well

729
01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:58.510
David Schaich (he): motivated classically, and so

730
01:05:59.310 --> 01:06:00.890
so you have one of those

731
01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.700
David Schaich (he): halls being read.

732
01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.070
David Schaich (he): the other being blue.

733
01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.330
you can keep track of it.

734
01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:16.870
David Schaich (he): Which energy level, the red particle which energy level of the

735
01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:31.030
David Schaich (he): partition function for n equals 2 is then just counting the

736
01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:38.590
David Schaich (he): number of microstates and a number of ways of arranging these 2 particles into 5 energy levels.

737
01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:44.130
David Schaich (he): You want to shout out what number that is.

738
01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:48.640
David Schaich (he): either in the room or remotely connected

739
01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:00.390
David Schaich (he): in zoom.

740
01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:05.260
David Schaich (he): And how do you get that?

741
01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.820
David Schaich (he): It's almost there?

742
01:07:09.830 --> 01:07:16.020
David Schaich (he): What it turns out to be is not to the 5, but 5 to the 2.

743
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:20.690
David Schaich (he): It's for the first particle there are 5 energy levels. It could go in.

744
01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.680
David Schaich (he): and for each of those fires that

745
01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.910
David Schaich (he): the blue particle can go on any of the other 5 energy levels.

746
01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:27.880
David Schaich (he): So

747
01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:30.690
David Schaich (he): almost there just stop

748
01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:33.330
thinking of the spin systems

749
01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:46.940
David Schaich (he): instead of this assignments of particles to boxes. But hmm. good efforts that gives us 25 microstates for this.

750
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:54.940
David Schaich (he): If we then go back to

751
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:59.480
David Schaich (he): you can

752
01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:06.770
David Schaich (he): that we will be interested in for it Quantum particles you would therefore

753
01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:12.050
David Schaich (he): claim, based on that are

754
01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:16.779
David Schaich (he): assumption of over-counting these essential microstates.

755
01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:20.020
David Schaich (he): The next there should be

756
01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:26.250
David Schaich (he): one over. 2 factorial is a half times 25

757
01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:29.479
David Schaich (he): is well and halfways

758
01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:31.770
David Schaich (he): out of

759
01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:38.160
David Schaich (he): putting these calls into the different boxes.

760
01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:47.810
Even that we are

761
01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:59.109
David Schaich (he): counting a discrete number of possibilities. The only sensible results for the partition function as we have set things up is

762
01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:05.770
David Schaich (he): well, there's an integer, number of ways. Just a positive integer that's counting a number of possibilities.

763
01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:13.420
David Schaich (he): It is 12. Point 5, yes. simply cannot be correct.

764
01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.160
David Schaich (he): And

765
01:09:17.109 --> 01:09:20.460
David Schaich (he): to see where we went wrong.

766
01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:21.830
David Schaich (he): We can just

767
01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:25.729
David Schaich (he): looking full detail at all 25

768
01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:30.470
David Schaich (he): of the microstates that are contributing

769
01:09:30.819 --> 01:09:33.689
David Schaich (he): to the

770
01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:35.689
David Schaich (he): So if we

771
01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:44.189
David Schaich (he): see, take these 5 boxes and label the one with the red ball in it by

772
01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:51.100
David Schaich (he): our labeled One with the Blue Ball. It be, you know.

773
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:59.210
David Schaich (he): label the empty boxes by Zeros. We can have

774
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:09.460
David Schaich (he): hopefully 25 possibilities. So let's see what we get with the first box.

775
01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:14.060
David Schaich (he): the Google in some other box.

776
01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:19.930
and then

777
01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.670
David Schaich (he): shift the

778
01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:30.460
David Schaich (he): and shift the Google i'm logging on Youtube. Make sure I don't

779
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:36.110
David Schaich (he): over count any of these possibilities.

780
01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:43.400
David Schaich (he): So I think that's all of the ways for the

781
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:56.190
David Schaich (he): Red ball to come first before the let me just reverse you. And yeah. another set of and possible

782
01:10:57.710 --> 01:10:59.260
David Schaich (he): micro states.

783
01:11:23.230 --> 01:11:24.310
David Schaich (he): and then

784
01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:31.220
David Schaich (he): finally squeezed into the side. Here we have the possibility for both of these particles to

785
01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:34.080
David Schaich (he): occupy the same energy level

786
01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:36.500
label that by a 2,

787
01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:44.130
David Schaich (he): so all to particles in one of these 5

788
01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:53.160
David Schaich (he): energy levels. So yes, we do have 5 columns with 5 rows of the 25 microstates, and we can distinguish the

789
01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:57.030
David Schaich (he): these first 20.

790
01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:10.220
David Schaich (he): You see that it's a set of 10. With that coming first before the new particle. another set of 10 with Lumen red and just reversed.

791
01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:13.820
David Schaich (he): So if we now go to the case of

792
01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:26.740
David Schaich (he): 2 particles being indistinguishable no longer. It was labeled by the one of these 2 sets, the different by labeling that corresponds to

793
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:37.480
David Schaich (he): one factorial sorry. One over 10 factorial is half n equals 2. That correct that over counting as we have with this last column.

794
01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:41.220
David Schaich (he): where the particles are occupying the save energy.

795
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:49.280
David Schaich (he): There was no over accounting in the first place. and no one over end factorial is needed to correct it.

796
01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:54.770
David Schaich (he): So, as I claim to start this off

797
01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:58.150
David Schaich (he): our hidden assumption when plugging in

798
01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:04.390
David Schaich (he): the usual form of the and particle economical partition function was that all of the particles

799
01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.270
David Schaich (he): occupying a different energy levels.

800
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:10.380
David Schaich (he): That's when the labeling

801
01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.730
David Schaich (he): brings in a multiplicative factor

802
01:13:15.150 --> 01:13:16.000
David Schaich (he): for

803
01:13:17.370 --> 01:13:21.460
David Schaich (he): going from distinguishable to in the central particles. and that

804
01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:26.020
David Schaich (he): over counting is not present and should not be corrected

805
01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:36.420
David Schaich (he): when there is any sort of multiple accuracy. So going to large numbers of particles, it doesn't need to be the case that all of them are in the

806
01:13:36.850 --> 01:13:39.710
David Schaich (he): same energy level. It's just that the

807
01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:47.580
David Schaich (he): over counting factor will pick up correct for only cases where some particles are in different energy levels. So we can

808
01:13:48.730 --> 01:13:55.650
David Schaich (he): start to have the impression that if you want to keep track of the over a back over accounting to correct

809
01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:09.710
David Schaich (he): in this case and discrete energy levels. Oh, you're going to some very complicated. We'll keep it to. Do you know your your case is starting from the single party application function

810
01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:16.540
David Schaich (he): and building up from there. So it can be classical case.

811
01:14:17.610 --> 01:14:21.190
David Schaich (he): Where are you just used the

812
01:14:24.330 --> 01:14:28.980
David Schaich (he): discretization of the energy levels as an to regulate the system and give us a

813
01:14:29.190 --> 01:14:31.830
David Schaich (he): partition function.

814
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:37.410
David Schaich (he): usually safe to assume continuously varying. and she is

815
01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:51.960
David Schaich (he): which makes it effectively impossible for 2 particles to have exactly the same energy to an infinite number of decimal places. So that, basically given teams.

816
01:14:54.810 --> 01:15:00.320
David Schaich (he): we all particles all right. different energy levels.

817
01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:06.300
David Schaich (he): and the

818
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:13.760
David Schaich (he): one over n factorial correction for over counting is correct in that classical context.

819
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:16.890
David Schaich (he): If you want to.

820
01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:30.800
David Schaich (he): the more careful and more precise. we should. will benefit us to rearrange this calculation, so that we don't need to keep track of how many microstates have

821
01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:35.220
David Schaich (he): people with different energy levels, and how many have them? The same energy level.

822
01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:37.340
David Schaich (he): What we can do

823
01:15:38.970 --> 01:15:50.540
David Schaich (he): is redefine. The concept of occupation number now not referring to It's like a trick that is. we used to provide the grand canonical

824
01:15:50.770 --> 01:15:56.140
David Schaich (he): partition function. But instead referring to the number of particles

825
01:15:58.530 --> 01:15:59.440
David Schaich (he): and

826
01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.870
David Schaich (he): each

827
01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:09.970
David Schaich (he): energy level, you still at all. and instead of the

828
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:13.850
David Schaich (he): classical approach of considering

829
01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:16.900
David Schaich (he): a single particle partition function

830
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:21.130
David Schaich (he): for each of the n particles.

831
01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.350
combining them

832
01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.140
David Schaich (he): with

833
01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.850
correction for over counting

834
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:34.240
David Schaich (he): quantum statistics, you know, with the energy level

835
01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:40.290
David Schaich (he): in the driver's seat. and so we flip this consideration on its head.

836
01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:45.490
David Schaich (he): So we don't go through each particle, and some of what energies it could have.

837
01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:49.440
David Schaich (he): Quoting statistics.

838
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:53.690
David Schaich (he): We go

839
01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.280
David Schaich (he): over each energy level

840
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:09.540
David Schaich (he): and consider the number of particles that can be occupied. Yet

841
01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:12.490
David Schaich (he): so

842
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:18.970
David Schaich (he): some over the part of the occupation number

843
01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:22.020
David Schaich (he): for each

844
01:17:23.730 --> 01:17:24.850
David Schaich (he): energy level.

845
01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:38.660
David Schaich (he): and also from the simple example that we went through in full detail. we can confirm that we are to do this.

846
01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:42.080
David Schaich (he): We don't end up with this dilemma.

847
01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:55.630
David Schaich (he): possibly over counting states, and then having to correct for that over counting It's some statistics approach. considering each energy level in turn.

848
01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:59.390
David Schaich (he): something over its occupation number.

849
01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:04.430
David Schaich (he): I'm. Sure some of the only accounts the you

850
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:11.920
David Schaich (he): valid or legitimate microstates and don't have to

851
01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.680
David Schaich (he): correct after the backed for

852
01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:16.280
David Schaich (he): okay

853
01:18:17.670 --> 01:18:22.430
David Schaich (he): over counting in the sensible particles that have

854
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:28.600
David Schaich (he): the same microscope to labeling. So I

855
01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:31.270
David Schaich (he): I've gone a bit slowly through this

856
01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:38.200
David Schaich (he): second conceptual step that it's added to the quantized energy levels in order to define calls and statistics

857
01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:48.000
David Schaich (he): just because it is a bit suffer rather than summing over single particle efficient functions. We sum over energy levels

858
01:18:48.010 --> 01:18:49.350
application numbers.

859
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:58.520
David Schaich (he): and we'll see you some examples. I think we have time. Get through them that will hopefully clarify

860
01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:04.040
David Schaich (he): how this goes in practice. In contrast to

861
01:19:04.570 --> 01:19:10.000
David Schaich (he): media procedure that we went through for classical Maxwell statistics.

862
01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.990
David Schaich (he): It has any well check to see

863
01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:21.740
David Schaich (he): if there are questions or objections about this way of rearranging

864
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:23.810
David Schaich (he): all right treatment

865
01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:26.600
David Schaich (he): of the statistical systems.

866
01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:36.570
David Schaich (he): probably good to move straight on to some examples to illustrate

867
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:41.510
David Schaich (he): how this works in the contrast with classical, non-hearted physics.

868
01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:45.140
David Schaich (he): So in order to carry out this sum over

869
01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:53.380
David Schaich (he): all possible occupation numbers for all of the available energy levels. First question we have to ask is.

870
01:19:56.490 --> 01:19:58.590
David Schaich (he): what are those possible

871
01:19:59.590 --> 01:20:01.320
David Schaich (he): occupation numbers

872
01:20:03.690 --> 01:20:09.350
David Schaich (he): in the first place. and just to bring in a

873
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:21.270
David Schaich (he): external information basically facts about the the universe from fall to physics, which we can't consider just an odds.

874
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:32.150
David Schaich (he): So at the level of quantum physics this turns out to be a theorem called it's been proving in 3 dimensions. There are

875
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:39.050
David Schaich (he): actually 2 possible 2 possibilities.

876
01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:48.470
David Schaich (he): at least to 3 spatial dimensions that we live in. and lower dimensional systems like

877
01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:56.100
David Schaich (he): particles that are confined to a surface. There are additional possibilities to

878
01:20:56.510 --> 01:21:02.600
David Schaich (he): arrange things in this way. 2 classifications that probably

879
01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:07.770
yes.

880
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:10.930
David Schaich (he): one class. It's known as both zones.

881
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.380
David Schaich (he): You are named after.

882
01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:13.130
Yeah.

883
01:21:13.210 --> 01:21:24.510
David Schaich (he): Indian physicists. the other my for me, almost named after. and we go for me.

884
01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:28.870
David Schaich (he): and they differ in the occupation numbers

885
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:37.530
David Schaich (he): that each of their microstates can have. So it's on the case. Any non-negative occupation number.

886
01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:43.820
David Schaich (he): It's perfectly fine. The energy level can be unoccupied. It can have

887
01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:47.960
David Schaich (he): one goes on minute to 3 or so on.

888
01:21:48.520 --> 01:22:00.240
David Schaich (he): I'm. Assuming for the moment that we have a system where all the goes on as far completely indistinguishable. which also turns out to be a feature of awesome physics.

889
01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:05.890
David Schaich (he): the underlying quantum field, that what a particle is

890
01:22:06.230 --> 01:22:08.310
the fundamental level again.

891
01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:17.450
David Schaich (he): and not have to worry about providing those sorts of things we consider identical. indistinguishable fermions.

892
01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:29.190
David Schaich (he): There are. there is a more limited, that set of possibilities in particular, the energy level. It either be I'm occupied.

893
01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:35.750
David Schaich (he): or it can be occupied. and multiple occupancy is not

894
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:37.820
David Schaich (he): allowed. There are.

895
01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:43.910
David Schaich (he): There's no way to get more than one for me on in a given energy level.

896
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:50.820
David Schaich (he): I'll mention. Both of these classes of particles

897
01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:53.790
David Schaich (he): are important to

898
01:22:53.970 --> 01:23:00.500
David Schaich (he): everyday life. Some famous Bosons you might have heard of The Higgs goes on

899
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.330
David Schaich (he): quantum particles of light

900
01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:06.870
David Schaich (he): I call photons, which are also bosonic.

901
01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:10.450
David Schaich (he): Yeah. the particle is called high ons.

902
01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:21.190
David Schaich (he): killing 4 atoms or bosons, and many more. How many are everything else in 3 dimensions. So things like

903
01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.310
David Schaich (he): electrons.

904
01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:27.000
David Schaich (he): protons.

905
01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:29.910
David Schaich (he): free particles.

906
01:23:30.850 --> 01:23:32.050
David Schaich (he): and the

907
01:23:33.630 --> 01:23:34.940
David Schaich (he): fact that

908
01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:47.110
David Schaich (he): no more than one for me on can occupy a given energy level is going down in history as something called

909
01:23:49.670 --> 01:23:51.510
David Schaich (he): all the exclusion principle

910
01:23:55.710 --> 01:24:06.710
David Schaich (he): named after Wolfgang. All the who essentially observed this behavior empirically before it was derived mathematically from quantum physics

911
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:14.420
David Schaich (he): share you the derivation of how the succeeding principle arises. Just say that it is

912
01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:27.040
David Schaich (he): thanks to this exclusion principle that chemistry exists, and life can be formed. and it is a

913
01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:30.180
David Schaich (he): fundamental feature of

914
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:33.820
David Schaich (he): quantum physics.

915
01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:47.360
David Schaich (he): We can go through the rough arguments that establishes why this is the case, and why the 3 dimensional particles break up, and these 2 possibilities

916
01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.110
I only do that.

917
01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:57.090
David Schaich (he): I request, because of his getting a bit more. We can't excited things as opposed to statistical physics.

918
01:24:58.750 --> 01:25:04.080
David Schaich (he): Sometimes there is a mistaken impression that this exclusion principle is due to

919
01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:15.050
David Schaich (he): some sort of physical repulsion between Birmingham, that they can't occupy the same space, and that's why they can't occupy the same energy level. Hit up against the shelter. and that is

920
01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:22.010
David Schaich (he): what I want to clarify. Is I'm not actually the case, there's no

921
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:30.570
David Schaich (he): physical repulsion between multiple fermions in a single energy level. It is actually

922
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:38.750
David Schaich (he): underlying feature of quantum physics at not hearing a request for details, I will be

923
01:25:39.370 --> 01:25:41.310
David Schaich (he): unexplained and just.

924
01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:45.700
David Schaich (he): You can as and aside

925
01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:51.650
David Schaich (he): to make sure that you have

926
01:25:52.290 --> 01:25:58.730
David Schaich (he): the correct view of. even if you Haven't seen.

927
01:25:59.490 --> 01:26:02.190
David Schaich (he): That's a classification previously.

928
01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:17.690
David Schaich (he): So instead of

929
01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:20.670
David Schaich (he): any more about

930
01:26:21.150 --> 01:26:25.270
David Schaich (he): quantum physics and the exclusion principle let's

931
01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.400
David Schaich (he): to step back to that

932
01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:43.860
David Schaich (he): very simple example. We had 2 particles with. I am degenerate energy level 0 through 4. And you went through

933
01:26:43.930 --> 01:26:47.420
David Schaich (he): this full calculation up here. Oh.

934
01:26:48.090 --> 01:26:50.580
a number of microsces for distinguishable.

935
01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:53.170
David Schaich (he): And in this usual particles.

936
01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.600
David Schaich (he): Maybe i'll ask you now how many

937
01:26:58.990 --> 01:27:00.860
David Schaich (he): microstates do we have

938
01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:06.980
David Schaich (he): if those indescentral particles are

939
01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:10.540
David Schaich (he): bosonic.

940
01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:21.740
David Schaich (he): That's right.

941
01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:29.990
David Schaich (he): Just quickly label them all as you did before.

942
01:27:34.130 --> 01:27:34.770
David Schaich (he): So

943
01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:51.890
David Schaich (he): there are 10 min microstates with a single particle in

944
01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:55.040
David Schaich (he): different combinations of energy levels.

945
01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:59.480
David Schaich (he): 5 with the occupancy

946
01:28:02.670 --> 01:28:12.240
David Schaich (he): and the last of these you can guess. The next question is going to be how many you? There are 4.

947
01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.980
It's 15 proposals.

948
01:28:21.450 --> 01:28:24.820
David Schaich (he): You don't need to shut that out, or you see that

949
01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:31.900
David Schaich (he): fermions we do not have this occupation number greater than one. So it is only these 2 columns.

950
01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:33.750
you 10,

951
01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:37.010
David Schaich (he): these 10 microstates

952
01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:42.440
David Schaich (he): for me on this. So

953
01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:46.900
David Schaich (he): both of these quantum possibilities are

954
01:28:47.150 --> 01:28:49.530
David Schaich (he): different from the

955
01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.510
David Schaich (he): bicycle

956
01:28:58.230 --> 01:28:59.730
David Schaich (he): results that

957
01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:10.010
David Schaich (he): probably and half microstates.

958
01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:14.040
David Schaich (he): Oh, thank you. That led to Maxwell's and statistics.

959
01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:15.730
David Schaich (he): But

960
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:22.680
David Schaich (he): I don't think, to notice that

961
01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:27.590
David Schaich (he): Well, both are different from the classical case or the

962
01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:32.700
David Schaich (he): one over n Factorial over counting factor is the

963
01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:38.250
David Schaich (he): is a correct or reliable approximation.

964
01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:40.810
We can assume that

965
01:29:40.930 --> 01:29:43.340
David Schaich (he): all particles are in different energy levels.

966
01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:47.670
David Schaich (he): It both on the and on, in cases, are clearly different from each other

967
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:49.430
exactly.

968
01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:53.280
David Schaich (he): There are different microstates

969
01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.330
David Schaich (he): in those 2 cases

970
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:02.360
David Schaich (he): means that there

971
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:03.980
David Schaich (he): statistics

972
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:08.230
David Schaich (he): are going to be different from each other

973
01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:11.870
David Schaich (he): as well as

974
01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:16.480
David Schaich (he): classical maximum case.

975
01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:23.630
David Schaich (he): So

976
01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:34.600
David Schaich (he): you shouldn't have enough time to go through at least one, and possibly both of these possibilities. So we'll start with

977
01:30:35.610 --> 01:30:38.210
David Schaich (he): Bosons. We're

978
01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:44.460
David Schaich (he): The resulting statistics is known as the

979
01:30:45.650 --> 01:30:49.600
David Schaich (he): It was Einstein in that distribution, with those on the side

980
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.160
David Schaich (he): statistics where

981
01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:07.120
David Schaich (he): so just to get a concrete illustration of the generic and possibly subtle procedure that

982
01:31:08.190 --> 01:31:12.450
David Schaich (he): we talked about it before introducing.

983
01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:17.510
David Schaich (he): So, computing a single particle microstate

984
01:31:17.670 --> 01:31:19.910
David Schaich (he): and raising it to

985
01:31:22.150 --> 01:31:23.200
David Schaich (he): you, want to.

986
01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:25.670
David Schaich (he): So

987
01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.180
David Schaich (he): over the energy levels

988
01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:32.590
David Schaich (he): and then

989
01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.890
David Schaich (he): over the possible occupation numbers

990
01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:41.250
David Schaich (he): for each of those under 2 levels.

991
01:31:42.810 --> 01:31:55.090
David Schaich (he): it is still useful to consider the simple case. the single possibility. So now this is rather than just a single particle

992
01:31:55.140 --> 01:32:05.150
David Schaich (he): partition function. This is a system. the single energy level. So the ground state is the only state.

993
01:32:06.710 --> 01:32:17.650
David Schaich (he): The corresponding energy is that capital block capital with me sub 0, and the microstates are

994
01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:24.880
David Schaich (he): completely specified, and it could not be specified. My.

995
01:32:26.230 --> 01:32:27.500
David Schaich (he): both the

996
01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:32.040
David Schaich (he): occupation number for this single energy level. So n 0,

997
01:32:36.810 --> 01:32:40.760
David Schaich (he): which determines the total energy

998
01:32:41.010 --> 01:32:43.180
David Schaich (he): of the system that goes into

999
01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:46.230
correct, not partition functions.

1000
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:49.350
David Schaich (he): Micro state energy is the

1001
01:32:49.840 --> 01:33:01.310
David Schaich (he): number of particles times the energy of the single allowed energy level. Let's see occupation number times that energy, level energy.

1002
01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:06.700
David Schaich (he): I apologize for reusing capital 8 in 2 different ways.

1003
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:13.240
David Schaich (he): Wasn't able to see a way to avoid that. Given the number of different energies that we have to worry about.

1004
01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:23.590
David Schaich (he): and it is the soft script I for microstates and L for energy levels that will help to distinguish those so

1005
01:33:25.530 --> 01:33:26.870
David Schaich (he): pre economical

1006
01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:31.780
David Schaich (he): partition function with a single energy level.

1007
01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:42.310
David Schaich (he): It's given by and some over occupation that we're from 0 to infinity of the exponential factor of

1008
01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:46.460
David Schaich (he): E to the minus inverse temperature times.

1009
01:33:46.670 --> 01:33:49.690
David Schaich (he): Microsoft

1010
01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:52.530
David Schaich (he): occupation number of times.

1011
01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:59.870
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Energy from this energy level. minus mu times, the number of particles

1012
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:01.950
David Schaich (he): in the

1013
01:34:02.630 --> 01:34:06.800
David Schaich (he): system, in the microstates, which is also that

1014
01:34:06.970 --> 01:34:08.190
David Schaich (he): single particle number.

1015
01:34:10.130 --> 01:34:23.620
David Schaich (he): We can pull out this overall factor of the occupation number in the so we have some over all. and 0, the exponential factor.

1016
01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:31.920
David Schaich (he): you, the minus V, that E 0 minus chemical potential. all raised the power and 0,

1017
01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:34.860
David Schaich (he): which is the

1018
01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.100
David Schaich (he): geometric series

1019
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:39.170
David Schaich (he): that

1020
01:34:41.170 --> 01:34:47.070
David Schaich (he): sums to one over one minus X. Where X is this exponential factor?

1021
01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:53.940
David Schaich (he): We'll put it out.

1022
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:55.950
David Schaich (he): maybe

1023
01:34:59.070 --> 01:35:00.890
David Schaich (he): concerned with the

1024
01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.410
David Schaich (he): geometric series only converges

1025
01:35:07.930 --> 01:35:13.400
David Schaich (he): with him. It's expansion. Parameter X is less than one, so that's this exponential factor

1026
01:35:15.170 --> 01:35:17.670
David Schaich (he): used to be less than one.

1027
01:35:18.010 --> 01:35:21.050
David Schaich (he): Assuming a natural positive temperature.

1028
01:35:22.090 --> 01:35:25.740
David Schaich (he): we have this exponential being less than one.

1029
01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:30.180
David Schaich (he): We need the factor in this use also to be positive.

1030
01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:40.420
David Schaich (he): Let's see difference between the energy and chemical potential quickly energy.

1031
01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:43.670
David Schaich (he): These, for all of these

1032
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:47.570
David Schaich (he): microstates in the those are all the energy levels.

1033
01:35:47.690 --> 01:35:58.830
David Schaich (he): even though here we have only a single energy level in general. in order for a geometric series to encourage the energy level will have to be greater than the chemical potential.

1034
01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.680
David Schaich (he): Given that we've.

1035
01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:06.320
David Schaich (he): They will assume that well in generality, that

1036
01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.570
David Schaich (he): every energy for

1037
01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:10.540
David Schaich (he): the energy of this polymer.

1038
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:14.560
David Schaich (he): all the natural chemical potential is negative.

1039
01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:17.470
David Schaich (he): This inequality is automatically satisfied.

1040
01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:20.200
David Schaich (he): That is one of those natural systems

1041
01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:25.670
David Schaich (he): and the last 2 min.

1042
01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:38.480
David Schaich (he): We will generalize this single particle partition function to the end particle. I'm sorry. generalize the single energy level partition function to

1043
01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:40.140
David Schaich (he): the case of

1044
01:36:41.150 --> 01:36:42.800
David Schaich (he): arbitrary number of

1045
01:36:44.050 --> 01:36:50.800
David Schaich (he): energy levels from 0 up to a capital L that could be taken to

1046
01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:58.340
David Schaich (he): just as the single energy, level occupation, number, define

1047
01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:01.070
number of particles for each microstate.

1048
01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:04.780
as well as the energy.

1049
01:37:05.190 --> 01:37:10.430
David Schaich (he): the set of all capital L plus one occupation numbers.

1050
01:37:12.630 --> 01:37:16.620
David Schaich (he): but the Microsoft Energy and article number and yeah

1051
01:37:18.130 --> 01:37:21.190
David Schaich (he): microstate as a whole.

1052
01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:28.110
David Schaich (he): And since we are assuming. not interacting.

1053
01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:29.860
you know, particles.

1054
01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:34.580
David Schaich (he): simple expressions for the internal energy.

1055
01:37:37.210 --> 01:37:37.950
Okay.

1056
01:37:45.190 --> 01:37:48.810
David Schaich (he): some over all microstates, occupation number

1057
01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:51.310
the energy for that microstate

1058
01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:56.330
David Schaich (he): article. Numbers simply some of the occupation numbers

1059
01:37:57.870 --> 01:38:01.190
David Schaich (he): to be an economical partition function. All right there

1060
01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:03.210
David Schaich (he): quickly and out.

1061
01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:09.960
David Schaich (he): Much of the we have a commentary. Now it has to some

1062
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:19.140
David Schaich (he): occupation numbers. For all of these energy levels you have

1063
01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:25.460
David Schaich (he): the same exponential factor, each the minus Beta Times

1064
01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:38.510
David Schaich (he): micro, State energy, the sum over energy levels minus the chemical potential, new type, c. Powerful number also be some for energy levels.

1065
01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:45.220
David Schaich (he): pull out the common factor of it.

1066
01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:50.440
David Schaich (he): And so at the end of that sum. and then

1067
01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:53.200
David Schaich (he): break up

1068
01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:56.210
David Schaich (he): the

1069
01:38:56.740 --> 01:39:06.210
David Schaich (he): exponential of the sum into a product of exponentials, each of which will depend only on a given N. 0 and one, and so on up to Ml.

1070
01:39:09.190 --> 01:39:11.040
David Schaich (he): So this is the same sort of

1071
01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:15.440
factorization. So it factorizes

1072
01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:17.610
David Schaich (he): into a product of

1073
01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:22.110
David Schaich (he): sounds of exponential factors.

1074
01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:27.860
David Schaich (he): one for the first energy level that's on the occupation number.

1075
01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:33.740
David Schaich (he): The first energy level, and so on

1076
01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:41.410
David Schaich (he): all the way up to the final. And if you love what you have.

1077
01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:45.500
David Schaich (he): so we can

1078
01:39:47.970 --> 01:39:49.740
David Schaich (he): rewrite this product.

1079
01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:53.030
David Schaich (he): Everything is the same up to the labeling of

1080
01:39:54.740 --> 01:40:05.470
David Schaich (he): the occupation number and the energy it comes in that energy level. It's just the product over L. Times. All of these geometric sounds.

1081
01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:17.060
David Schaich (he): So for you. same convergence criteria, that we had the single energy level case as well

1082
01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:21.500
David Schaich (he): generalized to give us a product of geometric series

1083
01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:24.190
David Schaich (he): that any more.

1084
01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:30.780
David Schaich (he): It's up in this room. Yeah, yeah.

1085
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:33.840
David Schaich (he): I'm grabbing up now. Okay. So

1086
01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:41.110
David Schaich (he): I'm: wrapping up the lecture now. But we are in 2 min.

1087
01:40:42.570 --> 01:40:48.380
David Schaich (he): and with that I think we all wrapped up a lot of our questions. This was the result. To get to

1088
01:40:48.450 --> 01:40:51.290
David Schaich (he): what we can see about it is that

1089
01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:59.080
David Schaich (he): there is a similar product to what we had in the classical case. So we're

1090
01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:03.960
David Schaich (he): we're dealing with single article, position, function 2.

1091
01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:17.720
David Schaich (he): The power of the number of particles. but we have no over counting from this quality approach of something over There's energy levels and then occupation numbers. so there's no need to worry about any

1092
01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:21.580
David Schaich (he): factors of n factorial to correct for that. But we're counting

1093
01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:29.480
David Schaich (he): so tomorrow i'll probably reiterate this because I want to pick quickly at the end. We will contrast this with all right.

1094
01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:32.990
David Schaich (he): and see how both of them

1095
01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:45.220
David Schaich (he): return to the Maxwell distribution of classical particles in the classical limits. and define what that classical of it is. That's all. For today.

1096
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:55.580
David Schaich (he): I'm given the need to get the exam set up. I'll just start setting things down right. Now get that recording stuff.
