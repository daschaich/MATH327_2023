00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.090
David Schaich (he): Okay, everything seems to be

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:09.240
David Schaich (he): up and running, and in focus.  We have some folks online, some in the room.

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.400
David Schaich (he): So let's get underway with

4
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.190
David Schaich (he): the Tuesday-afternoon

5
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.670
David Schaich (he): lecture, for

6
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.330
David Schaich (he): which I have a 6-digit code for you:

7
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.570
David Schaich (he): 7,

8
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.950
David Schaich (he): 3, 6,

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.060
David Schaich (he): 1, 2, 7.

10
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.430
David Schaich (he): I can't seem to turn that bar off,

11
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.340
David Schaich (he): but hopefully it will go away at some point.

12
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.780
David Schaich (he): What we've been doing so far this week,

13
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.870
after

14
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.040
David Schaich (he): looking at the basic results for ideal gases yesterday, we introduced the mixing entropy

15
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.650
David Schaich (he): that's related to reversible and irreversible processes.

16
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.120
David Schaich (he): We will look at that a bit more in the

17
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.950
David Schaich (he): tutorial on Thursday morning. Be able to

18
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.680
David Schaich (he): a simplified calculation of

19
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:32.430
David Schaich (he): the entropy of the final system. I will see the system after it's been re separated and confirmed the second.

20
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.730
David Schaich (he): We just you have a possibility argument for that yesterday

21
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.990
David Schaich (he): actually carry out that calculation

22
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.970
David Schaich (he): as the tutorial activity for this week. And then.

23
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.380
David Schaich (he): when we wrapped up yesterday was introducing the for sure.

24
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.570
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Statistical system and

25
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:09.830
David Schaich (he): negative of the responses control internal energy. We change in the world if they constant entropy and then connecting that to

26
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.320
mechanical work.

27
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.590
David Schaich (he): I can me that

28
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.070
David Schaich (he): to such a change in the volume all the way.

29
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.360
David Schaich (he): see this illustration that what? That's a

30
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.650
David Schaich (he): external force that changes the volume in which an ideal gas is being held.

31
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:44.430
David Schaich (he): Change that volume is negative Times. The area of the side of the container that moves it's considered a piston that can be moved by.

32
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:53.840
David Schaich (he): and the what yes is done by this is the in a product of yeah force

33
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.050
David Schaich (he): homes. The

34
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.040
David Schaich (he): displacement change.

35
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.640
the location that this

36
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.770
David Schaich (he): at times deal to X.

37
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.950
David Schaich (he): And this is then, we

38
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.260
David Schaich (he): resulting change in the energy.

39
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.600
David Schaich (he): the internal energy, specifically of this statistical system due to

40
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.510
David Schaich (he): the application of the sport. So we saw in this example.

41
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:37.040
David Schaich (he): The pressure is that negative change? Yeah. Internal. divided by the A. Delta X. So getting back to just

42
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.470
David Schaich (he): the usual force per unit area. You may well have it seen before.

43
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.370
David Schaich (he): which

44
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.140
David Schaich (he): also, right

45
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.030
David Schaich (he): hopefully, the microscopic change in volume. So that's

46
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.480
David Schaich (he): where we at

47
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.940
David Schaich (he): wrapped up yesterday morning. Are there any questions about

48
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.460
David Schaich (he): the ideal gas? It's mixing entropy? What

49
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.740
David Schaich (he): we got to with the pressure before we go on.

50
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.090
David Schaich (he): how this pressure can be used to do work for

51
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:31.250
David Schaich (he): not seeing any. Let's go ahead. And this rearrange this expression that we have here from simple consideration i'm back in.

52
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.600
David Schaich (he): You're on.

53
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.940
David Schaich (he): So here

54
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.820
David Schaich (he): the work does that change?

55
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.180
David Schaich (he): You control energy.

56
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.750
David Schaich (he): and also given by the negative of Pressure Times

57
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.170
David Schaich (he): a change in the volume where

58
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.860
David Schaich (he): we have assume the

59
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.730
David Schaich (he): take this, derivative giving us the pressure.

60
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.190
David Schaich (he): energy response with a cost of entropy.

61
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.180
David Schaich (he): It is also possible for this internal energy. You change

62
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.260
David Schaich (he): you to a change in the entropy.

63
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.700
David Schaich (he): so that in general

64
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.000
David Schaich (he): it's going to be the work that is done that due to some external force. What

65
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.290
David Schaich (he): other possible contributions turn to consider into course.

66
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.220
David Schaich (he): for now you can make the point that

67
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.410
David Schaich (he): this expression here work is the change in energy. It was only when the entropy

68
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.390
David Schaich (he): it's.

69
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.280
David Schaich (he): whereas the remainder of the employee.

70
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.460
David Schaich (he): even though we derive from the special case, it turns out to be in general results

71
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.560
David Schaich (he): that the identification of the work, as the negative of the pressure at times

72
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.540
David Schaich (he): change in the volume

73
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.990
David Schaich (he): is a relation that holds whether or not the entropy is fixed.

74
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.050
David Schaich (he): Go on and change that Delta volume to

75
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.690
David Schaich (he): so the

76
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.480
David Schaich (he): So this is

77
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.670
David Schaich (he): response which we can generalize

78
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.070
David Schaich (he): to a

79
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:08.810
David Schaich (he): relation governing the amount of work that corresponds to some macroscopic change

80
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.720
David Schaich (he): in the volume

81
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:18.390
David Schaich (he): so integrated from some initial value of the volume to some

82
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.740
David Schaich (he): okay

83
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.480
David Schaich (he): negative Pressure Times

84
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.790
accessible volume element.

85
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:32.690
David Schaich (he): We have to note that the pressure. Here. you shouldn't

86
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.070
David Schaich (he): think of it in general as a function of that home.

87
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.740
David Schaich (he): Let me know if you clear out the 3. It gets too bad as the

88
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.450
David Schaich (he): all right at the moment.

89
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:58.340
David Schaich (he): If we recall here equation of state for ideal gas. we also derive yesterday. Thank you.

90
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.030
David Schaich (he): An expression for yeah.

91
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:16.600
David Schaich (he): Pressure is the number of particles times their temperature divided by the volume. So, as the one changes along this integral, the pressure itself can be expected to change in jail.

92
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.900
David Schaich (he): One other aspect of this

93
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.940
David Schaich (he): work that we've defined here in the context of a statistical system that we should notice is

94
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:34.100
David Schaich (he): at negative sign. You actually so in the context of this. just an example that I want to zoom out to

95
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:34.840
that on

96
00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.320
David Schaich (he): reject it. that

97
00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:42.140
David Schaich (he): an increase in energy correspond to a decrease in the volume.

98
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.320
David Schaich (he): So that is

99
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.730
David Schaich (he): a way to remember it. That negative sign out from. and more generally.

100
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.290
David Schaich (he): when the work is positive.

101
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.350
David Schaich (he): That means that it is

102
00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:03.100
David Schaich (he): corresponding to some process that increases the eternal energy of the so it is being done.

103
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.460
David Schaich (he): i'm. On the gas, so on the system

104
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.910
David Schaich (he): by the rest of the university surroundings

105
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.560
David Schaich (he): of that system. This

106
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.750
David Schaich (he): raises the energy

107
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:25.900
David Schaich (he): internal energy specifically. and in the opposite case we have

108
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:33.350
David Schaich (he): a amount of work that is less than 0. For instance, the change in volume is positive, the gas is expanding.

109
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.850
David Schaich (he): and that corresponds to

110
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.760
David Schaich (he): by the gas

111
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.480
David Schaich (he): which reduces the

112
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.500
David Schaich (he): i'm out of internal energy

113
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.280
David Schaich (he): being sorted in that guess.

114
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:01.430
David Schaich (he): There's a we can turn now to the more

115
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.960
David Schaich (he): part of possible

116
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:12.810
David Schaich (he): ways to change the internal energy. In addition to just doing work and changing the volume by applying

117
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.990
David Schaich (he): okay. extracting an external force.

118
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.970
David Schaich (he): So for you

119
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.570
David Schaich (he): consider how

120
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.150
David Schaich (he): internal energy of the gas

121
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:47.660
David Schaich (he): you want to set this up by keeping the rolling constant That's guarantees that

122
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.160
David Schaich (he): no work is going to be done, that next to you

123
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:58.880
David Schaich (he): our results relating the work to integral. Okay. the change in the volume.

124
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:07.650
David Schaich (he): And with this constant for you, if we change the temperature of the gas.

125
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.990
David Schaich (he): recall that

126
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:25.580
David Schaich (he): the expression we derived from the internal energy. Whether or not the particles in this ideal gas, or distinguishable

127
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.560
David Schaich (he): that control energy.

128
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:35.420
David Schaich (he): it's 3 halves. It's another. Probably those times the temperature. If we change the temperature by some

129
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.110
David Schaich (he): you're going to test all about it. This gives us

130
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.180
David Schaich (he): you change in the internal energy

131
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:48.130
David Schaich (he): 3,000 time that change in temperature. and

132
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.470
David Schaich (he): gives us a way to

133
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:58.420
David Schaich (he): get the non-work contributions to the changing

134
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:03.670
David Schaich (he): energy. One that aspect of this. Yes.

135
00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:12.860
David Schaich (he): there was just a brief comment. And I. You know we're debating about. Raise this issue yesterday or not

136
00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:15.740
David Schaich (he): not for you.

137
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:23.850
David Schaich (he): but useful to understand what's going on in this context of applications of the

138
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:30.770
David Schaich (he): you may well object in your mind. Yes.

139
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.340
David Schaich (he): the starting point of all these analyses is

140
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.390
in particular

141
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:50.720
David Schaich (he): realization of statistical

142
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:55.190
David Schaich (he): demands. A fixed temperature as a starting point for analysis.

143
00:12:55.430 --> 00:13:02.530
David Schaich (he): So what does it mean to change the temperature and analyzing things in the context of

144
00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.450
David Schaich (he): So this.

145
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:11.430
David Schaich (he): if we go through it carefully, turns out not to be an issue.

146
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.300
David Schaich (he): It does mean that the process of going through things carefully.

147
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.860
David Schaich (he): so

148
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.700
David Schaich (he): terms of language that will be easier just to

149
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:29.680
David Schaich (he): take you to give it, and then talk in terms of changing the temperature in the canonical ensemble. What we're really doing is.

150
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.980
David Schaich (he): consider right here.

151
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.240
David Schaich (he): Different canonical systems with

152
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.980
David Schaich (he): different temperatures.

153
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.410
David Schaich (he): Each of these

154
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.130
David Schaich (he): it's going to be in that

155
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:57.600
David Schaich (he): he always assume this module

156
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.530
in the canonical approach

157
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.080
David Schaich (he): The temperature is fixed by

158
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:08.780
David Schaich (he): yeah

159
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.560
David Schaich (he): reservoir.

160
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:16.660
David Schaich (he): So I,

161
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:22.110
David Schaich (he): moving from one canonical system in contact with

162
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:29.990
David Schaich (he): a particular thermal reservoir. It's an initial temperature to a different canonical system in contact with a different

163
00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.220
your final temperature.

164
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.550
David Schaich (he): You can realize It's changing temperature

165
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:46.120
David Schaich (he): in your way that he's allowed by the the fires you fixed temperature at the start of the point.

166
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.360
David Schaich (he): and with this

167
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:54.340
David Schaich (he): conceptually understood. Then we don't have to talk about the process of

168
00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:01.360
David Schaich (he): fixing the the final temperature, fixing the initial temperature.

169
00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.980
David Schaich (he): We can just talk about changing the temperature. Keep in mind that

170
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:10.340
David Schaich (he): this is the blue is what we mean. If we speak about it.

171
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.930
David Schaich (he): it's faster and easier to say.

172
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.610
David Schaich (he): And this is what happens, going from

173
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.300
initial temperature to the final temperature.

174
00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.400
David Schaich (he): So is that

175
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.680
David Schaich (he): nothing in confusion or possibly

176
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.180
potential confusion that

177
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:33.340
David Schaich (he): the way we are able to change the temperature. We're talking about canonical systems.

178
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.400
David Schaich (he): You don't see entirely happy

179
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:45.680
David Schaich (he): the

180
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.770
David Schaich (he): Yeah. This. So 3 over 2 will be actually encountered this time last week.

181
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.120
David Schaich (he): Hey, how we doing that?

182
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.820
David Schaich (he): This is a reminder.

183
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:10.550
David Schaich (he): So this is coming from the derivative of the helpful free energy for an ideal gas.

184
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:17.080
David Schaich (he): Let's see this yesterday. Here is

185
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.290
David Schaich (he): last week

186
00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.050
David Schaich (he): for you an aspect of this looks.

187
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:35.370
David Schaich (he): I know you're from last week that

188
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:43.260
David Schaich (he): the internal energy of the gas here indistinguishable particles.

189
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:45.030
I guess so

190
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.380
David Schaich (he): is this

191
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:54.260
David Schaich (he): and perspective, the temperature. this 3 houses coming from

192
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.720
pretty much power of the temperature related to that.

193
00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.820
David Schaich (he): So everything else is independent of the temperature, it comes up

194
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:09.730
David Schaich (he): that fairly simple result which actually turns out to be the same for the

195
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:11.970
David Schaich (he): so

196
00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:19.950
David Schaich (he): that that's too

197
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:24.270
David Schaich (he): remind you where that 3 have came from. There we say

198
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:26.680
David Schaich (he): question here.

199
00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.640
David Schaich (he): Yeah, there is that

200
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.310
David Schaich (he): attendance code. Briefly. 7 3 6,

201
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.940
David Schaich (he): 1, 2 like 7.

202
00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.210
David Schaich (he): And

203
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:48.260
David Schaich (he): if that was the main question about. I was going through about formal way of thinking about.

204
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.250
David Schaich (he): You can charge ahead

205
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:54.690
David Schaich (he): and

206
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.230
David Schaich (he): and the page to get back to

207
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.180
David Schaich (he): the simple way of talking.

208
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:16.400
David Schaich (he): So we had you change the internal energy. 3 halves. and from last week the Times, the change in the temperature. And because

209
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.290
David Schaich (he): this is a contribution to

210
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:25.050
David Schaich (he): the energy that is not coming from the work. and because the work correspond to

211
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.090
David Schaich (he): enforcing concepts. Entropy.

212
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:34.200
David Schaich (he): i'm. Taking the derivative, with respect to the volume.

213
00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:40.050
David Schaich (he): We can expect this to require

214
00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.930
David Schaich (he): in corresponding change

215
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.500
David Schaich (he): in the entrepreneur

216
00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.160
David Schaich (he): of our system.

217
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:57.010
David Schaich (he): And this change in entropy is the reason there's not caught in that constant entropy derivative. That gave us the work.

218
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:59.470
David Schaich (he): So what we

219
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.020
David Schaich (he): the call with the

220
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:03.970
David Schaich (he): entropy is.

221
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:07.530
David Schaich (he): and the

222
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:18.160
David Schaich (he): or both. You could express this in the form. Okay? And yeah.

223
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.090
David Schaich (he): plus about you.

224
00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.510
David Schaich (he): temperature, independent pieces that differ

225
00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:33.620
David Schaich (he): depending on whether the partners in the gas are at the

226
00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:40.020
David Schaich (he): Oh, the temperature is hiding in that term that will relate that will be wavelength

227
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.130
which

228
00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:45.100
David Schaich (he): disproportionate to you one over the square root of the temperature.

229
00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.890
David Schaich (he): So this here

230
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.500
David Schaich (he): that minus 3. This becomes

231
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:51.810
David Schaich (he): same.

232
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.170
David Schaich (he): We have

233
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.780
what we were seeing earlier

234
00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:01.180
David Schaich (he): temperature, independent stuff to the site.

235
00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.450
David Schaich (he): and then consider it

236
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.530
David Schaich (he): what change in this entropy we should expect to result

237
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:19.460
David Schaich (he): from expected, of course, all to this sort of change in the temperature. from

238
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:26.150
David Schaich (he): moving from one canonical system to the next at different temperatures. So

239
00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.490
David Schaich (he): this change is going to be the change

240
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.420
David Schaich (he): if we have, and it's

241
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.610
David Schaich (he): over to here from the

242
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:55.340
David Schaich (he): differentiation of that one on the differential. it all there, and because 3 half, and she is the energy. This is you change

243
00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.100
David Schaich (he): in that internal energy divided by the temperature.

244
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:02.650
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

245
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:08.310
David Schaich (he): rearranging you now have a new expression for the change in

246
00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.970
David Schaich (he): the internal energy.

247
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.890
David Schaich (he): Let's see.

248
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.470
Yeah.

249
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:20.530
David Schaich (he): is just the temperature of times, the change in the entropy.

250
00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:27.460
David Schaich (he): And this he is. Yeah, it's an additional contribution

251
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:53.160
David Schaich (he): constant volume, so that there's no work, and also a constant number of particles. As usual. you define this

252
00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.250
David Schaich (he): to the

253
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.530
David Schaich (he): that is transferred.

254
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:04.730
David Schaich (he): transferred between the system and the surroundings of the use.

255
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:11.180
David Schaich (he): What is the simple queue? The heat exchange is

256
00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.920
David Schaich (he): temperature, times, the change in the entropy of the gas.

257
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.420
David Schaich (he): which we can again generalize

258
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:23.720
David Schaich (he): to the integral from some initial entropy.

259
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.480
David Schaich (he): Oh. T. Ds.

260
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.200
David Schaich (he): That temperature they will depend on the entropy

261
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.000
David Schaich (he): on your cell. I'm. Assuming here that

262
00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:45.130
David Schaich (he): as a function of temperature in the canonical ensemble. or you have

263
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.850
David Schaich (he): that we had a favor, is

264
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.220
David Schaich (he): which is

265
00:22:54.530 --> 00:23:06.730
David Schaich (he): going to be the case for all of these ideal, all interacting systems, the only time this could become problematic is the presence of what a couple of things transition something we will get to after the

266
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.290
David Schaich (he): spring break later on in this term.

267
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:15.480
David Schaich (he): So

268
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:30.010
David Schaich (he): there is one more conceptual order to make That's

269
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.400
David Schaich (he): heat and work. So

270
00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.630
David Schaich (he): in this context with no work.

271
00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:49.300
David Schaich (he): and they change. The internal interview is just given by the.

272
00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:54.950
David Schaich (he): And maybe I should have said earlier on, when introducing these changes in

273
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:58.410
David Schaich (he): energy. In the first place. good help you.

274
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:09.900
David Schaich (he): The energy and entropy are not being created with a stroll. What's going on is

275
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:13.050
David Schaich (he): shift it.

276
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.030
David Schaich (he): The queen

277
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:31.810
David Schaich (he): system, the ideal gas particles that we're considering, and that surrounding that was fixing his temperature.

278
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.440
David Schaich (he): I'll say that energy and interview are flowing.

279
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:42.920
David Schaich (he): and your 2 work problem, your system in exchange with these surroundings. and I will also

280
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:51.930
David Schaich (he): say that all we're going to consider here are cases in which this energy, electricity, flow

281
00:24:53.190 --> 00:25:03.150
David Schaich (he): is reversible, so that the full amount of entropy in the combined system awesome surroundings is

282
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.560
David Schaich (he): not.

283
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:14.550
David Schaich (he): in addition to the energy not changing in accordance with the first of all to one dynamics.

284
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.590
David Schaich (he): the overall entropy of the universe.

285
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:25.330
David Schaich (he): You can see them is not being changed by it.

286
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:29.960
David Schaich (he): Any of these processes that are shifting energy back and forth

287
00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.160
David Schaich (he): in the system.

288
00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:46.700
David Schaich (he): So

289
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:54.660
David Schaich (he): before I go on further, this might be good place to check in. See if there any questions about

290
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.180
David Schaich (he): definition of he as I was to work with.

291
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.900
Yeah.

292
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.850
David Schaich (he): they fit together.

293
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.100
David Schaich (he): not seeing any.

294
00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.970
David Schaich (he): We'll define one more piece of terminology.

295
00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:25.740
David Schaich (he): So. just having said that we will

296
00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.480
David Schaich (he): assume reversible processes where

297
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.200
David Schaich (he): no entropy is.

298
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.010
David Schaich (he): I've created

299
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:36.630
David Schaich (he): through this stuff

300
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.830
David Schaich (he): to the manipulations that we are doing to our ideal system.

301
00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.530
David Schaich (he): We call it

302
00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.100
David Schaich (he): that

303
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.280
David Schaich (he): it is possible to consider cases in which

304
00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:06.660
David Schaich (he): there is no heat transfer, but the overall amount of energy in this compile system and surroundings

305
00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.510
David Schaich (he): is increasing.

306
00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.740
David Schaich (he): So there are 2

307
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.670
David Schaich (he): different pieces of terminology, one of which we've already encountered

308
00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:23.200
David Schaich (he): yesterday, or possibly last week, so we can recall that

309
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:31.640
David Schaich (he): we talked about is in there processes. Yes. leave the amount of entropy. Be cool.

310
00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.750
David Schaich (he): so they have.

311
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:38.620
David Schaich (he): We change the entropy of being 0,

312
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:44.400
David Schaich (he): and necessarily then lead to

313
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.780
David Schaich (he): no heat being exchanged between the system and the 3 on this

314
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.880
David Schaich (he): more generally.

315
00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:55.570
David Schaich (he): What are you?

316
00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.920
David Schaich (he): Have processes with? No, you transfer

317
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.060
David Schaich (he): so Q. Equals to 0.

318
00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:18.080
David Schaich (he): It's possible to have no key transfer with creation of entropy.

319
00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.540
David Schaich (he): The process is not necessarily isentropic.

320
00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:22.790
David Schaich (he): Let me see

321
00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.790
David Schaich (he): that the process.

322
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.200
David Schaich (he): There's no heat transfer that is.

323
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.240
David Schaich (he): we're

324
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:43.910
David Schaich (he): things and tropical processes

325
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:53.600
David Schaich (he): and reversible. So our assumption that we're only going to be talking about the

326
00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:59.080
David Schaich (he): in this module means that we can use Adiabatic and isotropic interchangeably.

327
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:00.490
David Schaich (he): especially if you

328
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.760
David Schaich (he): look into some of the other.

329
00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:10.540
David Schaich (he): It's good to keep in mind that there is this distinction between them. that's all.

330
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.310
and trouble processes

331
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:16.230
David Schaich (he): in addition to any of the

332
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:21.260
David Schaich (he): if we think about

333
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:29.170
David Schaich (he): actually carrying out physical experiments that carry out this sort of process with no transfer.

334
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:38.460
David Schaich (he): we talked earlier in the context of the microeconomic on something about how difficult it is in practice

335
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.330
David Schaich (he): to

336
00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:46.240
David Schaich (he): prevent heat exchange for the isolate system, so that the micro canonical ensemble applies

337
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:53.950
David Schaich (he): the way to carry out a process so that no keep in exchange between the system and the surroundings

338
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:58.110
David Schaich (he): is to make sure that's

339
00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:00.930
David Schaich (he): the process occurs

340
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:13.310
David Schaich (he): quickly enough. so there's not time for any energy to be exchanged in this form of heat. So an idiomatic process in general is one that occurs quickly.

341
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:17.790
David Schaich (he): No time for

342
00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.640
David Schaich (he): this sort of heat exchange

343
00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.210
David Schaich (he): to actually occur

344
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.200
David Schaich (he): the other extreme. We have

345
00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.830
David Schaich (he): very slow processes.

346
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:38.010
David Schaich (he): This

347
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:46.630
David Schaich (he): you'll allow all possible heat exchange to be accomplished.

348
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:54.480
David Schaich (he): and what this heat exchange does in the context of the canonical ensemble is keep the temperature.

349
00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:59.690
David Schaich (he): I'll be here. System of the ideal gas

350
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.590
David Schaich (he): in equilibrium with this external reservoir

351
00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.070
David Schaich (he): in the report fixed.

352
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.160
David Schaich (he): Yes. it's starting Value

353
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.310
David Schaich (he): fancy term for these sorts of processes

354
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:33.870
David Schaich (he): use for the next. We because we go through through dynamic cycles. That this is an is a thermal process

355
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.620
David Schaich (he): just like is in tropic. We have.

356
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.280
David Schaich (he): I saw it meeting equal. all right.

357
00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:41.460
The temperature

358
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:51.780
David Schaich (he): and it In real physics experience real processes are going to live

359
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.720
David Schaich (he): in between these 2 extremes of

360
00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:59.320
David Schaich (he): past idiomatic offices and slow

361
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.030
David Schaich (he): I some thermal ones, but usually

362
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.500
David Schaich (he): things that we do day to day

363
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:15.550
David Schaich (he): happen to be carried out quickly enough. They are closer to you. Do that.

364
00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.150
David Schaich (he): then.

365
00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.430
David Schaich (he): So

366
00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:39.380
David Schaich (he): that was a bit of terminology that will be useful. As for you. go on to do more interesting things with this. So we know. put together all that we have in terms of ways for

367
00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.350
David Schaich (he): energy

368
00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:50.560
David Schaich (he): ideal. You get us to change both due to work and you to heat exchange.

369
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.760
David Schaich (he): It will be useful to

370
00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.440
David Schaich (he): first to do that in aversion

371
00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:11.270
David Schaich (he): you mentioned. So rather than talking about the entropy as a function of Yeah, and the temperature of the volume

372
00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.820
David Schaich (he): temperature as a function of

373
00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:18.600
David Schaich (he): just

374
00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:25.640
David Schaich (he): fix the number of particles, as usual, for the worry about anything

375
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.190
David Schaich (he): non-trivial happening on that side of things. So

376
00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:34.880
David Schaich (he): with this change of variables, the internal energy

377
00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:36.190
David Schaich (he): use

378
00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:39.690
David Schaich (he): no longer a function of temperature

379
00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:44.200
David Schaich (he): that turns into one. Okay.

380
00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.300
David Schaich (he): And if we you able to expand

381
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.240
David Schaich (he): the change in internal

382
00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:54.800
David Schaich (he): yes.

383
00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:12.489
David Schaich (he): the internal energy at the end of that change. It's something i'm sure it value of Yes, and entropy and volume it's going to be equal to.

384
00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.820
David Schaich (he): That's not

385
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:30.980
David Schaich (he): plus scale expansion in each of these Independent. That's my that's not times derivative of that internal energy. With respect

386
00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:32.210
David Schaich (he): to S.

387
00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:43.860
David Schaich (he): The responsibility. energy to the interview next.

388
00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:48.800
David Schaich (he): and then with higher order, terms that we can neglect if we

389
00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.650
David Schaich (he): focus on infinitesimal changes. So moving

390
00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.370
David Schaich (he): you, starting, going to the other side.

391
00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:00.120
David Schaich (he): rub it.

392
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:08.620
David Schaich (he): The energy at the end of the process, and this the energy at the beginning being just the symptoms of change, the energy

393
00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:14.430
David Schaich (he): and change in the entropy we will also make, even if accessible.

394
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:15.680
we can

395
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:23.400
David Schaich (he): recall that we're back working in terms of energy and attribute. Yes. micro canonical relation

396
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:30.630
David Schaich (he): between entropy and energy with a fixed particle number.

397
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:43.800
David Schaich (he): It's just related to one over the temperature. So inverting it that relation and considering the response of the energy, yeah. with respect to the change in the entropy

398
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:48.190
David Schaich (he): just gives us the inverse of the inverse temperature of the temperature itself.

399
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:52.080
David Schaich (he): The final term.

400
00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.450
David Schaich (he): It's an accessible change in all of you.

401
00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:08.390
David Schaich (he): Multiply by precisely yeah response to the energy and a fixed entropy that we defined to be the pressure. We come up with a

402
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:11.710
David Schaich (he): very simple expression for

403
00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:15.600
David Schaich (he): the general change in internal energy

404
00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:16.680
David Schaich (he): you have to make it.

405
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:18.270
The assumptions out

406
00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.140
David Schaich (he): volume is fixed when the interview is fixed.

407
00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:26.260
David Schaich (he): Anything else. There are 2 Chinese

408
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:32.930
David Schaich (he): Tdf. Minus Pdd: so temperature times change in entropy.

409
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:35.010
David Schaich (he): This pressure has changed

410
00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:39.630
David Schaich (he): which are exactly Oh, yeah.

411
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.890
David Schaich (he): have to find earlier today to be the heat

412
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:48.700
David Schaich (he): and the work. So this relation, in fact, is a

413
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:52.940
David Schaich (he): generalization

414
00:36:55.050 --> 00:37:03.380
David Schaich (he): of the first law. Let's go, and we can expressing words say that

415
00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:11.960
David Schaich (he): right? So when we introduced the first one we just said it was calculated conservation. There you're working with the

416
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:16.490
David Schaich (he): if the energy is fixed.

417
00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:25.040
David Schaich (he): This is generalizing that to economical ensemble, where energy can be exchanged between the system and the surroundings.

418
00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.050
David Schaich (he): The any such change.

419
00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:32.180
David Schaich (he): the systems, internal energy.

420
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.620
22.

421
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.970
David Schaich (he): This equation must be matched

422
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:46.110
David Schaich (he): by a corresponding transfer of he.

423
00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.800
David Schaich (he): So a heat exchange.

424
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:56.900
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

425
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.710
David Schaich (he): As they're on the surroundings

426
00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.130
on the system.

427
00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:05.940
David Schaich (he): we're both.

428
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:14.380
David Schaich (he): So the conservation of energy is now generalized to allow the energy in the system to change

429
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:28.230
David Schaich (he): diversity of the 2 ways. We've introduced changing energy. Okay. moving a shift to energy around in between the system and its

430
00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.440
David Schaich (he): so. This generalized first law is

431
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:39.450
David Schaich (he): key equations for ideal gases.

432
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:46.400
David Schaich (he): Now begin not applying to

433
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:53.730
David Schaich (he): systems of dynamic cycles, key engines and refrigerators.

434
00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:00.260
David Schaich (he): Yes, equation. So it joins.

435
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:08.610
David Schaich (he): So people's keep plus work

436
00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:12.320
David Schaich (he): is one key equation

437
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:22.290
David Schaich (he): relation between internal energy and temperature. The fact that the entropy is always proportionable. Too bad

438
00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.760
David Schaich (he): Volume times T to the 3 half power.

439
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.300
David Schaich (he): which means that

440
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:39.980
David Schaich (he): the condition of Council of Entropy that is relevant for determining the work

441
00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:49.200
David Schaich (he): from the pressure is going to require just keeping this particular combination of temperature and volume constant. you don't have to.

442
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:50.050
What about

443
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:52.850
David Schaich (he): the other pieces of the

444
00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:58.320
David Schaich (he): one of these? And finally, we have the

445
00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.870
David Schaich (he): equation of things

446
00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:09.790
David Schaich (he): that relates all 4 of these macroscopic, or through dynamic quantities, pressure of all the

447
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:12.700
David Schaich (he): particle number and temperature

448
00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:14.700
David Schaich (he): and

449
00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:21.840
David Schaich (he): 4 equations pretty small.

450
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:24.390
David Schaich (he): I the question of 6

451
00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:28.260
David Schaich (he): and result for energy and entropy

452
00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:30.950
David Schaich (he): are going to

453
00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:36.460
David Schaich (he): thermodynamic systems behavior when we carry out any possible manipulations of.

454
00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.040
David Schaich (he): So we started all

455
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:41.740
David Schaich (he): discussion, or he's in work by thinking about

456
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:56.680
David Schaich (he): applying a force to change the volume of the gas. You can't do that. either decreasing the volume. Pushing this piston in to the container, we can pull the piston out, increase the volume

457
00:40:56.990 --> 00:41:03.920
David Schaich (he): in both directions. You can go quickly, make an Adiabatic process, or you can go slowly and keep things isothermal.

458
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:07.540
David Schaich (he): or we can just to fix that

459
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:20.180
David Schaich (he): and feed them. Huge 5 increase in temperature reservoir around the system. Or you probably take you away. I

460
00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:24.070
David Schaich (he): No.

461
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.750
David Schaich (he): All of those processes and generalizations help them

462
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:29.770
things that we can imagine

463
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:36.030
David Schaich (he): doing to an ideal gas. and as we do them. Applying

464
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.900
David Schaich (he): this set of equations, these key equations will

465
00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:44.160
David Schaich (he): tell us how that gas behaves and give us that. Now

466
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:45.320
predictions

467
00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:46.360
David Schaich (he): for

468
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.670
David Schaich (he): how that

469
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:56.410
David Schaich (he): on the behavior of the large scale to dynamic companies. All that gas

470
00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.010
captured mathematically.

471
00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.320
David Schaich (he): It will be particularly

472
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:06.390
David Schaich (he): interested in. carry out some sequence

473
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:08.860
David Schaich (he): of manipulations for

474
00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:12.400
David Schaich (he): these sorts of processes and changing the gas

475
00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:26.260
David Schaich (he): That's after we carry out this full sequence. we take end up with the ideal gas system back in its initial

476
00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:30.180
David Schaich (he): States in particular.

477
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:41.800
David Schaich (he): through a dynamic State or Macro State, rather than the micro State. That depends on it. the disposition of every single particle

478
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:45.190
David Schaich (he): in the gas. So this macro stages

479
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:52.420
David Schaich (he): characterized by it. This macroscopic quality is like pressure, flowing temperature, internal energy.

480
00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.970
David Schaich (he): Such a sequence

481
00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:00.820
David Schaich (he): that gets back to the starting point is.

482
00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:04.200
David Schaich (he): I should

483
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:08.070
David Schaich (he): use the same terminology as

484
00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:13.800
David Schaich (he): cycle

485
00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.260
David Schaich (he): repeated it.

486
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:28.240
David Schaich (he): Arbitrary number of in order to do things like

487
00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:37.940
David Schaich (he): move energy around, to do work. How many environments or you work to

488
00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:44.220
David Schaich (he): for one

489
00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:49.070
David Schaich (he): reservoir to another, or generalizations there up.

490
00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:56.070
David Schaich (he): If we have a thermodynamic cycle, some repeatable sequence of these processes that does work

491
00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:01.530
David Schaich (he): defines an engine transfer, he

492
00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.440
David Schaich (he): refrigerator. and we will now see

493
00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.110
David Schaich (he): how to analyze

494
00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:18.500
David Schaich (he): these sorts of practical devices, like engines and refrigerators on the basis of statistical physics.

495
00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:19.910
David Schaich (he): I think there's

496
00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:25.110
David Schaich (he): just enough time to introduce one useful tool

497
00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.870
David Schaich (he): in those sorts of analyses.

498
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.920
David Schaich (he): so

499
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.090
we space here to do so.

500
00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.240
David Schaich (he): So because we have

501
00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.380
David Schaich (he): fixed number of particles.

502
00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:49.280
David Schaich (he): All right. Equations.

503
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:52.760
Why, yes.

504
00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.550
David Schaich (he): all information about it.

505
00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:58.920
David Schaich (he): Dynamic macro stage

506
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:02.000
David Schaich (he): is

507
00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:06.650
David Schaich (he): provided

508
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:10.640
David Schaich (he): in terms of 2 variables

509
00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.630
David Schaich (he): which we can't choose

510
00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:17.220
David Schaich (he): to be the pressure and the volume

511
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:21.740
David Schaich (he): from the I do guess Well.

512
00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.680
David Schaich (he): temperature in terms of

513
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.090
David Schaich (he): the internal energy is that

514
00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:44.960
David Schaich (he): we have 10 times the temperature over. We have. I was pressured and boarding from the ideal gas law and the the Times.

515
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:50.800
David Schaich (he): This team we some power of 3 halves.

516
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:54.000
David Schaich (he): so a useful tool

517
00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:00.230
David Schaich (he): he is representing that.

518
00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.300
David Schaich (he): hey?

519
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:07.960
David Schaich (he): I was really Macro State

520
00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.980
David Schaich (he): is your point. my plane.

521
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.960
David Schaich (he): one axis of the planes, the pressure.

522
00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.440
David Schaich (he): and the other.

523
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.610
David Schaich (he): So

524
00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:34.940
David Schaich (he): this defines what is known as a pressure volume. diagram

525
00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:49.600
David Schaich (he): the plane volume, one access pressure on the other. any given macro states.

526
00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:01.860
David Schaich (he): And if we carry out any of the processes that we described.

527
00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:07.880
David Schaich (he): Those will respond to you lines

528
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:15.720
David Schaich (he): in this diagram. and if we connect a sequence of those processes together to

529
00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:26.580
David Schaich (he): complete one of those repeatable cycles over and over again. The it has to correspond

530
00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:32.080
David Schaich (he): to a close path. So we have some sequence of processes

531
00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.840
David Schaich (he): just going down there, up there.

532
00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:40.210
David Schaich (he): around and over. I think it's the system back

533
00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:42.560
David Schaich (he): exactly to its initial state.

534
00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:52.950
David Schaich (he): This is defining a sequence of processes and microstates at the end of each call that gets back around to the starting point.

535
00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:58.200
David Schaich (he): and can be repeated. not occurring a number of times

536
00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:03.530
David Schaich (he): for this purposes of running a mentioned on the refrigerator, and so on.

537
00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:05.730
David Schaich (he): So we will

538
00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:11.000
David Schaich (he): next week. We have examples of

539
00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:15.180
David Schaich (he): particular processes and cycles in terms of these.

540
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:20.720
David Schaich (he): and see how the mathematics of the cycle, of course.

541
00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.540
on to

542
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:24.250
David Schaich (he): this visual representation there of

543
00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:29.660
David Schaich (he): and before then tomorrow, tomorrow, Thursday morning.

544
00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:39.110
David Schaich (he): Step back just a bit to looking more like that mixing entropy, and also for over

545
00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:45.940
David Schaich (he): topics we discussed in last week's tutorial. That was on the entropy that came up yesterday

546
00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:46.940
David Schaich (he): as well as

547
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:53.670
David Schaich (he): and even before that tomorrow I should be

548
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:59.270
David Schaich (he): through marking the remaining computer project submission. So it'll get back to you on the

549
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:04.650
David Schaich (he): a couple of left, so it'll just take me a few more hours over the next.

550
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:06.400
David Schaich (he): Yeah, so

551
00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:10.520
David Schaich (he): i'll do that after I get that back to you

552
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:12.390
with that

553
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:18.610
David Schaich (he): questions before I' you to enjoy the rest of your afternoon get back to you

554
00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.720
David Schaich (he): to work on that market.

555
00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.050
David Schaich (he): I want to see you

556
00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:31.270
David Schaich (he): Thursday morning when a tutorial, and then next week, for

557
00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:33.300
David Schaich (he): it's still a dynamic.

558
00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:50.420
David Schaich (he): There, you see.
