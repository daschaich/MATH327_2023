1
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.910
David Schaich (he): Okay, that should be the recording underway on a seasonal Monday morning in Liverpool.

2
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.510
I'm not surprised that

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.580
David Schaich (he): a few people have

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.980
David Schaich (he): decided not to brave the weather, and just sign in remotely.  But

5
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.350
David Schaich (he): do be sure to

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.180
David Schaich (he): speak up if there are questions, if the audio's not clear, things like that.

7
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.830
David Schaich (he): Let's quickly

8
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.600
David Schaich (he): pick up with the

9
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.080
David Schaich (he): recap of what we were looking at last week. It's been

10
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.000
David Schaich (he): most of a week since we dealt with the lecture material, though

11
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.110
David Schaich (he): the activities in the tutorial on Thursday will be

12
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.010
David Schaich (he): useful just a few minutes.

13
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.350
David Schaich (he): So what we've been looking at are

14
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:13.120
David Schaich (he): applications of the canonical ensemble that fixes the particle number and temperature in a statistical ensemble --- a collection of particles evolving through time

15
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:21.360
David Schaich (he): and probabilistically sampling all accessible microstates.  And before I go into all of that

16
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.070
David Schaich (he): I should remember to give you the 6-digit code:

17
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.580
David Schaich (he): code. 3, 6, 6, 3, 1, 3.

18
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:42.310
David Schaich (he): The specific example that we focus on last week, after considering the very simple spin system and seeing how its information content

19
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.740
David Schaich (he): had observable physical effects in terms of the internal energy as well as the

20
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.020
David Schaich (he): entropy, we looked at

21
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.610
David Schaich (he): the classica, non-relativistic, non-interacting or ideal gas,

22
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.910
David Schaich (he): where the energies of the micro-states depend on continuously varying quantities: The momenta of the particles.

23
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.810
David Schaich (he): This required that

24
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.140
David Schaich (he): the usual some of the microstates that we have defining the partition function

25
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.570
David Schaich (he): of the system

26
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:29.580
David Schaich (he): needs to be regulated, made sensible. So take the limit. We're only discrete moment to our economics that we discrete them into our accessible, and then the limit where those become continuous.

27
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.900
David Schaich (he): that partition function. or

28
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.070
David Schaich (he): equivalently it's more on the

29
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.010
David Schaich (he): is our starting point. It becomes

30
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.460
David Schaich (he): an integral over those

31
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.080
David Schaich (he): continuous momentum.

32
00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:00.270
David Schaich (he): If the energy is dependent on other variables, like position as well, so we have some traffic potential or external electric field that

33
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:11.860
David Schaich (he): I gave a position dependent energy to the particles we would have to integrate over positions as well as and from the partition function, or almost 300. The starting point

34
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.940
David Schaich (he): we we're able to derive the internal energies

35
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.950
David Schaich (he): in entropy

36
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.450
David Schaich (he): for

37
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.470
David Schaich (he): both cases of

38
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:40.280
David Schaich (he): distinguishable and indistinguishable particles in the gas. and we will pick up right now, Bye. looking in detail or more detail at

39
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:50.640
David Schaich (he): what the what the results we survived really me, or amount to of content, and then move on to look at

40
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.570
David Schaich (he): It's called the mixing entropy.

41
00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:06.370
David Schaich (he): and then start looking at thermodynamic cycles, which is something that's all you may. Well, I've seen before I yieldcast all. I come to a cycle here. instead of just introducing these as

42
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.680
David Schaich (he): think this is coming out of nowhere for it as knowledge. We are

43
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.980
David Schaich (he): providing them and building them up from the microscopic dynamics of the many degrees of freedom in our statistical system. So

44
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.780
David Schaich (he): any questions about where we are plan for where we are headed

45
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.420
David Schaich (he): about your community. What's just go on to recall what we found.

46
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.510
David Schaich (he): How are you

47
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.810
David Schaich (he): internal interviews for

48
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.360
David Schaich (he): the case of both distinguishable? Yeah, I think, December, what particles oil down to

49
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.660
David Schaich (he): a very simple expression just 3 half times number of particles times the temperature

50
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.390
David Schaich (he): so. and here there is

51
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.570
David Schaich (he): no dependence on the information that we have about these particles

52
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.250
David Schaich (he): in this case, whether we can

53
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.960
David Schaich (he): label them and tell them apart, as they are bouncing around in the container in which we define

54
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.820
David Schaich (he): this gas. And

55
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.740
David Schaich (he): this is in contrast to

56
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:38.880
David Schaich (he): spin system that we looked at last week where there was a clear difference. And

57
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.330
David Schaich (he): just briefly, I mentioned something that you might want to convince yourself of. The reason for. This

58
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:57.930
David Schaich (he): is because the difference in the number of microstates between distinguishable and indistinguishable cases. For an ideal gas is

59
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:06.020
David Schaich (he): just that factor of one over n factorial. The number of different ways that particles can be enabled if they are.

60
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.540
David Schaich (he): See what your goal

61
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.100
David Schaich (he): and this one over N Factorial is

62
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.640
David Schaich (he): in the same

63
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.580
David Schaich (he): for all the energies or all the

64
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:35.590
David Schaich (he): which. if you look back to the work on spin systems was not the same. In that case the number of microstates for a given energy varied, depending on that energy.

65
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.880
David Schaich (he): And here difference between the distinguishable and indistinguishable internal energies

66
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.640
David Schaich (he): was different as a consequence

67
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.170
David Schaich (he): also mentioned in passing.

68
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.800
David Schaich (he): But this is also independent of the

69
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.750
David Schaich (he): volume which we will come back to when we get to the

70
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.640
David Schaich (he): I know gas law and the pressure

71
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.500
David Schaich (he): at the moment. We still have a few more derive results.

72
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.720
David Schaich (he): for we're coming from last week

73
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.130
David Schaich (he): where we looked at the entropy.

74
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.140
David Schaich (he): and we saw with those

75
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.260
David Schaich (he): did differ, and also depended on the volume

76
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.680
David Schaich (he): screen. So.

77
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:41.480
David Schaich (he): And you can an extra factor of. and in the denominator of this logarithm.

78
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:47.320
David Schaich (he): where that lambda th is the thermal double the wavelength

79
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.130
David Schaich (he): we can think of as

80
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:59.100
David Schaich (he): sort of volume that is occupied by each particle. But before going into that interpretation

81
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.840
David Schaich (he): it's interesting to ask

82
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.220
David Schaich (he): which of these entropies

83
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:15.250
David Schaich (he): is the larger one they'll give you away few seconds to consider that, and see if you are

84
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.680
David Schaich (he): willing to ship it out.

85
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.760
David Schaich (he): There you are an answer.

86
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.880
David Schaich (he): It is not immediately obvious just to look at them.

87
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.500
David Schaich (he): because there are 2 places where

88
00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:04.440
David Schaich (he): these entropies differ in the costing factor on that first term proportional to N. As well as the factor of n that sneaks into the logarithmic term

89
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:09.030
David Schaich (he): question is, which of those winds, or do they go in the same direction

90
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.840
David Schaich (he): for large in?

91
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.460
David Schaich (he): And if we

92
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:20.780
David Schaich (he): consider the difference between them. the indistinguishable entropy minus the distinguishable entropy.

93
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.560
David Schaich (he): Then 3 half of those 5 pads cancel off. We just one factor of 10,

94
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.520
David Schaich (he): and then everything but the year

95
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:35.680
David Schaich (he): and log one over N. And S. I cancels it out with the logarithmic factories.

96
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.150
David Schaich (he): The and I can pull out an overall negative sign to make that.

97
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.990
David Schaich (he): and then we can

98
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.710
David Schaich (he): recognize as

99
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:53.710
David Schaich (he): the negative of the startling, this approximation which we apply to get things into this form.

100
00:09:54.450 --> 00:10:03.150
David Schaich (he): which is in the less than 0 approximation wide on that, and much greater than one as always. So

101
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:10.540
David Schaich (he): we are managing this. Yes, I it's less than Sd. and that

102
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.810
David Schaich (he): it reflects the extra information

103
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.020
David Schaich (he): that the

104
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.060
David Schaich (he): gives us. There's more that is knowable in principle about

105
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.090
David Schaich (he): There's more that's noble in principle, without the same triple particles

106
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:37.700
David Schaich (he): in the indistinguishable case where we don't have the option of labeling them

107
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.810
David Schaich (he): to stay

108
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.560
David Schaich (he): a couple more comments about the entropy use which I

109
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.040
David Schaich (he): started getting into before

110
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.210
David Schaich (he): asking this question, about which is larger.

111
00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.960
David Schaich (he): So you can see that

112
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:10.550
David Schaich (he): depend on the volume quite clearly in that model with the connector.

113
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:16.580
David Schaich (he): and even more than that, they both depend on the specific combination

114
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:22.290
David Schaich (he): volume, time system will definitely wavelength to the minus third power.

115
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.770
David Schaich (he): which

116
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:35.980
David Schaich (he): break that up into the linear length of the volume that we defined last week, divided by that we've mine. you and

117
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:43.180
David Schaich (he): the set up of a classical non-relativistic chaos

118
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:48.960
David Schaich (he): demands that this factor. The length of the volume, compared to the thermal wavelength

119
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.840
David Schaich (he): of particles, is much larger than what.

120
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.050
David Schaich (he): So I mentioned that so

121
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.400
David Schaich (he): you can think

122
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.360
David Schaich (he): this cube of the thermal wave life

123
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.730
David Schaich (he): as

124
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:18.610
David Schaich (he): occupied volume of the particles. and from the entropy we can see that

125
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:30.920
David Schaich (he): things get dangerous when that occupied large or comparable to this total volume of the system. What do I mean? Dangerous

126
00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.770
David Schaich (he): I to

127
00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.500
David Schaich (he): It's Entropy's are still visible. Consider it.

128
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.520
David Schaich (he): If that

129
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.350
David Schaich (he): thermal volume

130
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:57.130
David Schaich (he): comparable to, or even larger than the physical volume

131
00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:02.880
David Schaich (he): in which our canonical system is maintained. Then it is

132
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:09.680
David Schaich (he): large enough. The factor in these logarithms becomes less than one. The longer. Those themselves become negative.

133
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.680
David Schaich (he): and

134
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.910
David Schaich (he): at least in the limits where that's

135
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:26.090
David Schaich (he): longer than become as it's. Argument goes to 0, the algorithm diverges to negative infinity. So at some point it will overwhelm that pre-factor and lead to

136
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.030
David Schaich (he): a negative entropy.

137
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.530
David Schaich (he): which

138
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.980
David Schaich (he): you should

139
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:40.640
David Schaich (he): be able to see is actually nonsensical. and

140
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.280
David Schaich (he): I can't see that just

141
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:51.490
David Schaich (he): from the general definition of the energy, something over all, like an entropy, something over a microstate with that negative sign

142
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.480
David Schaich (he): the probability Pi times the log of pi.

143
00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.950
David Schaich (he): all of those pi's are less than, or equal to one

144
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.220
David Schaich (he): greater than or equal to 0. So

145
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.320
David Schaich (he): and in general, you know, we can only have a probability equals one. Where there's a single micro state.

146
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:16.820
David Schaich (he): In general the probabilities are less than one, so that logarithm is negative, cancel out the overall negative.

147
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:23.520
David Schaich (he): we have a sum of strictly positive quantities. So a negative entropy is not

148
00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.440
David Schaich (he): physical.

149
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.420
David Schaich (he): And what has happened here is that

150
00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.750
David Schaich (he): our assumption of working with the classical.

151
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.740
David Schaich (he): And all this the guess broken down.

152
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.380
David Schaich (he): And

153
00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.640
David Schaich (he): you recall that this

154
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:54.140
David Schaich (he): Beverly wavelengths and all consider the square case to get rid of it media

155
00:14:55.410 --> 00:15:06.230
David Schaich (he): square root that we have on the way. This is pranks constant squared times, pi squared over twice the mass times the temperature.

156
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:16.610
David Schaich (he): and when this becomes large is what either the mass or the temperature become small compared to H bar squared.

157
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.700
David Schaich (he): so

158
00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:22.230
David Schaich (he): break down, either in a little bit of small mass which

159
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.420
David Schaich (he): it's, it's become important. or, in particular.

160
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.410
David Schaich (he): if we have low temperatures

161
00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.760
David Schaich (he): that would lead to that, each part

162
00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.860
David Schaich (he): squared, times high squared, being

163
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:50.930
David Schaich (he): larger than, or even comparable to too high. Sorry to Mt. There's also an L squared

164
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.370
David Schaich (he): coming into the comparison

165
00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.550
David Schaich (he): between

166
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.640
David Schaich (he): the volume and this occupied.

167
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:04.870
David Schaich (he): so you will see in a few weeks after we're done. Applying the

168
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.730
David Schaich (he): canonical ensemble to

169
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:14.340
David Schaich (he): equations of states and thermodynamic cycles. When we consider low temperatures, you will have to

170
00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:23.150
David Schaich (he): adapt some of our assumptions, and in particular introduce quantum effects which I emphasize You don't need to be familiar with it all. I'm going to.

171
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.670
David Schaich (he): I

172
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.150
David Schaich (he): introduce all aspects of it. Awesome physics like will develop within that low temperature regime.

173
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.630
David Schaich (he): So that is the

174
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:45.500
David Schaich (he): main physical performance and comparisons between the distinguishable and indistinguishable

175
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.440
David Schaich (he): cases of ideal gases that we

176
00:16:48.450 --> 00:17:00.590
David Schaich (he): ran out of time for last Tuesday. and just pause to check for any questions that this might have inspired before moving on to

177
00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:06.000
David Schaich (he): the next aspect of ideal gases we will consider

178
00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.990
David Schaich (he): I'll seem happy with yeah

179
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:20.319
David Schaich (he): conceptual lessons extracted from those a mathematical calculations.

180
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.020
David Schaich (he): So let's

181
00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.890
David Schaich (he): to generalize the economical ensemble, set up just a bit kind of like we did with

182
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:36.260
David Schaich (he): the microcanical ensemble when we introduced the temperature and looked at heat exchange

183
00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.980
David Schaich (he): to check that that temperature behaved sensibly.

184
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:48.450
David Schaich (he): Zoom all the way out there. To get to this illustration on the screen.

185
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:57.510
David Schaich (he): you will consider a an analogous 3 stage process involving 2 canonical subsystems now.

186
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.050
David Schaich (he): where you initially have them.

187
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:02.970
David Schaich (he): just for simplicity, with the same

188
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.680
David Schaich (he): temperature, the same number of particles.

189
00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:15.200
David Schaich (he): We have 2 canonical systems. We'll make it a and Omega B. Which have

190
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:22.370
David Schaich (he): some number of particles in a given volume that will also keep to be the same between those 2 systems for simplicity.

191
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.750
David Schaich (he): And then we say that those

192
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:33.130
David Schaich (he): 2 systems share a wall that we can remove allow

193
00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:46.110
David Schaich (he): particles to shift from one side of the system to the other. and then, after some time the system has re thermalized. We will reinsert that walls. We get a

194
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:56.240
David Schaich (he): combined system, Omega, c. And then, re inserting the wall. We get back to some omega, a prime. you know, make a B prime.

195
00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:03.450
David Schaich (he): which again have well. The temperature is always the same as an intensive quality.

196
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.070
these thermal equilibrium systems

197
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:15.050
David Schaich (he): in the combined system. We need to analyze things in terms of twice the number of particles

198
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.220
David Schaich (he): that can freely explore

199
00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.990
David Schaich (he): twice the volume

200
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:26.190
David Schaich (he): of those 2 systems combined. and then we, the Wall. gets us back to

201
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.770
David Schaich (he): just one factor of the volume. Each of these re separated systems

202
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:36.210
David Schaich (he): and some number of particles on each side, and the question is.

203
00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.270
okay.

204
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:42.040
David Schaich (he): pretty drawn here in blue. What happens to the entropy as we

205
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:49.540
David Schaich (he): go through these steps, allow the system to evolve the time in this way, and we want to see that

206
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:56.080
David Schaich (he): our mathematical description of particles in terms of the economic.

207
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.260
David Schaich (he): the second ball from dynamics

208
00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:03.340
David Schaich (he): that we derive a similar consideration a few weeks ago.

209
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.910
David Schaich (he): so that we haven't gone off the rails

210
00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:12.350
David Schaich (he): in the way that we are analyzing things. Yeah. yeah.

211
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.240
David Schaich (he): We heard this as

212
00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:25.180
David Schaich (he): mixing these particles in these 2 different systems zoom back in

213
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.390
David Schaich (he): to make a bit more legible on the screen

214
00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.760
David Schaich (he): if it focuses.

215
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:49.160
David Schaich (he): So this is actually just the the question that was

216
00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:57.330
David Schaich (he): on the screen at the start of the class which most of you on zoom may only have seen for a measures. So once I remember, to

217
00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.690
David Schaich (he): share screen.

218
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.410
David Schaich (he): and that

219
00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:19.670
David Schaich (he): running down the setup gives you a chance to think about. Consider that question.

220
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.150
David Schaich (he): So what happens

221
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:30.110
David Schaich (he): from? We have those 2 canonical systems, both in from equilibrium with the same temperature? T.

222
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:37.520
David Schaich (he): You combine them to get that overall combined system, and then

223
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.980
David Schaich (he): we separate them into

224
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:47.940
David Schaich (he): systems will make a a prime, and they'll make a B prime. And the entropy

225
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:56.500
David Schaich (he): that we have in each case is an extensive quantity, so just adds across those subsystems when they are not combined.

226
00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:01.310
David Schaich (he): that goes to the combined entropy. And then we have an essay crime

227
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:05.810
David Schaich (he): plus Sv. Prime, adding across that we separated systems.

228
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:08.300
David Schaich (he): So

229
00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.820
David Schaich (he): we first consider the case of indistinguishable particles.

230
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.340
David Schaich (he): and then we can compute

231
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.650
David Schaich (he): at least a few of these entropies

232
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:30.840
David Schaich (he): just based on the what we did last Tuesday, and just reviewed in the last few minutes.

233
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:33.950
David Schaich (he): So

234
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.560
David Schaich (he): s a. And Sv. Because

235
00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:42.210
David Schaich (he): for simplicity, we gave them the same volume in the same number of particles.

236
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.300
David Schaich (he): That is all that the

237
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.970
David Schaich (he): and the same temperature that goes into the

238
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:53.850
David Schaich (he): thermal wavelength. Those 3 quantities are all that

239
00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.700
David Schaich (he): the individual entropy

240
00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:01.520
David Schaich (he): depends on it. It's a reminder. This was 5 haves

241
00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:13.080
David Schaich (he): and plus n log of the following name over end. Times. The thermal way of life that depends on the temperature. which is easy map to

242
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.880
David Schaich (he): It's distributed that factor of 2 across those 2 terms.

243
00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:29.600
David Schaich (he): And that's similarly we have only a single system of individual articles. but there are 2 end of them.

244
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:35.200
David Schaich (he): and twice the volume. Still at the same temperature we get to the

245
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.620
David Schaich (he): middle stage

246
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.180
David Schaich (he): of this process.

247
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.920
David Schaich (he): and

248
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.980
David Schaich (he): this gives us

249
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:48.830
David Schaich (he): that 5 has times 2, and that

250
00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:52.790
David Schaich (he): plus that 2 N. Logan

251
00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:56.910
David Schaich (he): twice the volume over

252
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.830
David Schaich (he): to N. Wavelength cube.

253
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:15.810
David Schaich (he): which again we split up into that cancel all into 5 and plus 2, and boy to this cancel the over. And

254
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.520
David Schaich (he): so

255
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:23.070
David Schaich (he): you see that upon

256
00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:27.810
David Schaich (he): removing the wall between those 2 initial systems a and B.

257
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:33.420
David Schaich (he): Nothing happens in terms of the entropy. It just stays the same as it was.

258
00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:39.170
David Schaich (he): So this is consistent with the

259
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:46.680
David Schaich (he): second law of thermodynamics. The entropy has not decreased.

260
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:53.450
David Schaich (he): even though it has not increased. The second law allows the entropy to stay the same as time goes on.

261
00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:06.670
David Schaich (he): Perhaps a sharper question now is. what happens to the entropy when we re inserted that all in reset rates the systems.

262
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:11.440
David Schaich (he): So

263
00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:32.830
David Schaich (he): the complication at this stage that makes things a bit more interesting is that even though I draw on that in the systems a prime at B point here at the end.

264
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:37.460
David Schaich (he): the same number of particles on each side that we started off with.

265
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:38.720
David Schaich (he): Initially.

266
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:48.350
David Schaich (he): there's no guarantee that that actually happens when we re insert a wall with a fixed position. As those particles are bouncing around the larger combined volume.

267
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:57.420
David Schaich (he): It's entirely possible that different numbers of particles could end up on either side of the wall. Just in the same way, in the

268
00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.920
David Schaich (he): heat exchange example of the micro canonical system, we saw

269
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:04.100
David Schaich (he): the possibility of different amounts of energy.

270
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:05.420
David Schaich (he): and they go

271
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:12.510
David Schaich (he): in either of the micro canonical systems. I'll say where we separated after being put in the thermal contact and the latitude

272
00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.630
David Schaich (he): exchange energy.

273
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.690
David Schaich (he): So

274
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:23.210
David Schaich (he): if we want to compute the entropy of those re separated systems.

275
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.330
David Schaich (he): we need it

276
00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.920
David Schaich (he): some over all possible

277
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.020
David Schaich (he): particle divisions.

278
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:41.200
David Schaich (he): I'll say that if we have new particles.

279
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.920
David Schaich (he): and that system essay prime

280
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.840
David Schaich (he): on the left.

281
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:57.190
David Schaich (he): Then there must be 2 in minus new particles in the other system on the right.

282
00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:03.240
David Schaich (he): so that the total which is conserved throughout this whole process remains to

283
00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.460
David Schaich (he): and

284
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:21.560
David Schaich (he): one. But if we again think back to the heated shape example. when we combine the systems. We asked about the number of microstates, and then from that we got the entropy for a microcanonical system in thermal equilibrium.

285
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.720
David Schaich (he): Now, with the canonical system. We have to start with the partition function.

286
00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.500
David Schaich (he): And you need to do this

287
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:34.360
David Schaich (he): when computing

288
00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.510
David Schaich (he): the partition function.

289
00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.810
David Schaich (he): that from which we then

290
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:43.910
David Schaich (he): derive

291
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.620
David Schaich (he): that final entropy of the re separated systems.

292
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:54.640
David Schaich (he): And as for that micro canonical case

293
00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:03.100
David Schaich (he): where the number of microstates in the combined system was the product of the possible microstates. In each of the 2 subsystems

294
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.260
David Schaich (he): the efficient function, the overall system

295
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:12.890
David Schaich (he): is going to be the product

296
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:14.980
David Schaich (he): of

297
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.710
David Schaich (he): the partition functions for

298
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.170
David Schaich (he): each of those 2 subsystems.

299
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.370
David Schaich (he): Is it a prime with new particles?

300
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:29.500
David Schaich (he): It's multiplied by so P. Prime with 2 N. Minus new particles.

301
00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.050
David Schaich (he): This partition function is

302
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:38.180
David Schaich (he): something that we computed last Tuesday. We can just

303
00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.390
David Schaich (he): plug in that result.

304
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.940
David Schaich (he): and

305
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:52.660
David Schaich (he): the call that we are working with interesting from our articles, at least for the moment.

306
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:59.370
David Schaich (he): One has new particles. temperature to you.

307
00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.030
David Schaich (he): You know there is

308
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.700
David Schaich (he): 2 and minus new and the same willing that temperature.

309
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:19.830
David Schaich (he): So that is one over new factorial. because we cannot distinguish between the different labeling of those new particles. The single particle partition function was just

310
00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:27.760
David Schaich (he): the volume of the system over its occupied, for you raised to the power of the number of particles.

311
00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.260
David Schaich (he): and then we have exactly the same factors

312
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:35.520
David Schaich (he): for 2, and minus new particles.

313
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:50.270
David Schaich (he): in place of just the new particles from the other system. So this is really easy to combine. You have a new factorial to N. Minus new factorial.

314
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.490
David Schaich (he): And then

315
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:57.690
David Schaich (he): this volume ratio to the factor to the power new, and this is off with a minus

316
00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:58.980
David Schaich (he): and only

317
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.610
David Schaich (he): lambda cube to the power to n is left.

318
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:15.000
David Schaich (he): Now, that's for a single division of particles to do on one side to and

319
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:17.410
David Schaich (he): and

320
00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.540
David Schaich (he): out this.

321
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:20.710
David Schaich (he): so

322
00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.040
David Schaich (he): that you said it was necessary

323
00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.450
David Schaich (he): going to give us

324
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.870
David Schaich (he): that final combined system.

325
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:37.840
David Schaich (he): maybe a. For something to be some over all possible values that we could have

326
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:44.010
David Schaich (he): no particles at all in the right hand side of all. Sorry in the left hand side, all of them right

327
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:52.280
David Schaich (he): going all the way through the other extreme, where all the particles are on the left, and none of them are in the right, so you equals to end.

328
00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:57.880
David Schaich (he): There is

329
00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.980
David Schaich (he): the expression we need to sum over

330
00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:06.930
David Schaich (he): this: the over Lambda queue

331
00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:14.480
David Schaich (he): power to end is independence of new. What gets left in the some

332
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.510
David Schaich (he): is that

333
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:34.910
David Schaich (he): combination of factorials which actually looks a bit like we would get from a binomial coefficients. You recall that the binomial coefficient. So if we choose any particles out of 2 and total.

334
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.290
David Schaich (he): that is

335
00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.050
David Schaich (he): 2 and factorial over you, factorial

336
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.540
David Schaich (he): to n minus new factorial.

337
00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.210
David Schaich (he): So we can rearrange this, pull out our

338
00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:58.870
David Schaich (he): substitute that I know your coefficients into this expression. Yeah, they

339
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:13.730
David Schaich (he): difference of one over 2 n factorial and then some over new from 0 to 2, and of those binomial coefficients 2, and choose new.

340
00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.320
David Schaich (he): that some is Sol. You can give an expression for it.

341
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:21.960
David Schaich (he): And if we

342
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:31.200
David Schaich (he): just leave things as they are right now, and it look at the

343
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.460
David Schaich (he): resulting entropy

344
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.880
David Schaich (he): s prime, which is that some of the

345
00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:50.240
David Schaich (he): what SSD. Prime. This is the derivative with respect to the temperature of the negative.

346
00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:54.150
David Schaich (he): it's you

347
00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.340
David Schaich (he): Z. Prime

348
00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.310
David Schaich (he): in the year

349
00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:01.600
David Schaich (he): as the function whose derivative we need to take, because the entropy.

350
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.270
David Schaich (he): and

351
00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:17.070
David Schaich (he): breaking up that logarithm of these 3 factors being multiplied together into the sum or difference of

352
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:18.770
David Schaich (he): 3 logarithms.

353
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:23.710
David Schaich (he): we have a 2, and coming down

354
00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:28.150
David Schaich (he): you derivative of at

355
00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.320
David Schaich (he): Boy the over.

356
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:46.020
David Schaich (he): Then the queued. We need to remember that that Lambda cube has a factor of the temperature within it. It's not just a constant, so it's not trivial

357
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.770
David Schaich (he): derivative in there.

358
00:33:50.940 --> 00:34:00.940
David Schaich (he): The other terms are independent of the temperature, so we can take the derivative that just gets rid of that overall factor of temperature that comes in the definition of the entropy.

359
00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:06.540
David Schaich (he): We have one over 2 n factorial

360
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.280
David Schaich (he): much we can.

361
00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:22.830
David Schaich (he): This is the log of 2 n factorial with negative sign. And then, finally, this one help the complicated some over new of the binomial coefficients

362
00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:26.820
David Schaich (he): to and choose new. So this is

363
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:37.699
David Schaich (he): kind of a awkward expression. complicated logarithm of

364
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.800
David Schaich (he): which is hard to compare with

365
00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:47.110
David Schaich (he): the entropy that we had when we first 2 stages. This is just n plus a Pm. Again

366
00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:48.230
David Schaich (he): term.

367
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:59.110
David Schaich (he): and what we can do is bring to bear some of the work we did in the tutorial last Thursday, where we

368
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.930
David Schaich (he): consider these sorts of entropies problem. 2 systems that were combined.

369
00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.830
David Schaich (he): and we saw.

370
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:18.840
David Schaich (he): and there, in that context, on Thursday we were looking at micro canonical systems.

371
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.600
David Schaich (he): but it also holds for canonical systems.

372
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:29.610
David Schaich (he): It's counting the number of microstates going into here, the partition function and the results and energy.

373
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.900
David Schaich (he): It is a general

374
00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.580
David Schaich (he): result from the work that we did in the tutorial.

375
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.310
David Schaich (he): That's

376
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:46.720
David Schaich (he): essentially all i'll be in for you.

377
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.310
David Schaich (he): He's accounted for

378
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:51.260
David Schaich (he): from

379
00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:54.180
David Schaich (he): the even division

380
00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.100
David Schaich (he): of the degrees of freedom

381
00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:01.110
David Schaich (he): between the 2 subsystems. So

382
00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:11.030
David Schaich (he): whether we're looking at a distribution of energies from last Thursday, or the distribution of particles that we have here we have and a

383
00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.190
David Schaich (he): equals, and the

384
00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:20.450
David Schaich (he): which is equal to the end we started off with that is much larger than one. and

385
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:28.790
David Schaich (he): just this option, for the division of particles is going to dominate the entropy

386
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:33.370
David Schaich (he): of this final system, and that is actually the reason why

387
00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:40.990
David Schaich (he): I went ahead and drew that sort of case here, even though the 6 particles being considered here, are not exactly

388
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:49.850
David Schaich (he): a very large number, we can imagine the usual tend to be power 23, where we saw that the

389
00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.220
David Schaich (he): that one's on the entropy.

390
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:58.720
David Schaich (he): I mean from this sort of approximation we're accurate to

391
00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:05.180
David Schaich (he): roughly one part of 10 to the 20. For all practical purposes it is the exact result

392
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.620
David Schaich (he): that the entropy is given

393
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.050
David Schaich (he): Bye. This specific case

394
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:20.150
David Schaich (he): out of the full sum over new. We just have to consider that case of new equals and half of the total number of 2 and particles.

395
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.140
David Schaich (he): and this approximation.

396
00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:30.340
David Schaich (he): So this is an approximation

397
00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:38.680
David Schaich (he): that's one that becomes exact in the so called aerodynamic limit, with the number of degrees of freedom

398
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:43.020
David Schaich (he): goes to infinity, and it immediately tells us that

399
00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:52.910
David Schaich (he): this final system just involves the same number of individual particles in the same volume at the same temperature.

400
00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:00.180
David Schaich (he): So we can just write down

401
00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.820
David Schaich (he): the

402
00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:10.200
David Schaich (he): final entropy and recognize that it is the same. Yes. the initial entropy.

403
00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:14.410
David Schaich (he): and V, and T all the same. So we again get that

404
00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:18.740
David Schaich (he): 5 n plus 2 n log V. Or N lay in the queue

405
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:22.320
David Schaich (he): which was equal to the interview of the combined system.

406
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:25.430
David Schaich (he): So

407
00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:31.230
David Schaich (he): we see in this three-stage, process, that, at least in terms of the energy in terms of the entropy.

408
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:42.170
David Schaich (he): There is essentially nothing dramatic happening. We can freely remove the whole separating these 2 containers. and then we insert it

409
00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.980
David Schaich (he): and the entropy, the State is the same.

410
00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.660
David Schaich (he): So this is

411
00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.550
David Schaich (he): maybe the answer you came up with

412
00:38:53.580 --> 00:39:00.150
David Schaich (he): before we got going today, when considering what would happen if we treated the air in this room

413
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.380
David Schaich (he): in the area of the hall. It's 2 canonical systems with

414
00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.940
David Schaich (he): 10 to the power, 25 particles or so.

415
00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:13.790
David Schaich (he): If we over the door between the hall of the room. nothing very dramatic happens. If we close it again

416
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:19.190
David Schaich (he): again. Nothing dramatic happens. We can previously

417
00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:25.000
David Schaich (he): carry out that process of opening the door.

418
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:29.360
David Schaich (he): and just as freely close again

419
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:31.720
David Schaich (he): without

420
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.610
David Schaich (he): making a big change to

421
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:46.650
David Schaich (he): the overall entropy of the universe. So this sort of process where

422
00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:54.120
David Schaich (he): we can reverse it. we

423
00:39:59.050 --> 00:39:59.970
David Schaich (he): is

424
00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:10.700
David Schaich (he): formally referred to as a reversible process for obvious reasons, and the course models in this case for the entropy of the process. The process does not change the entropy

425
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.650
David Schaich (he): of the systems that we have before it. After being analyzed

426
00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:19.350
David Schaich (he): through the canonical ensemble or statistical.

427
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.530
David Schaich (he): so I may as well do the same

428
00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.040
David Schaich (he): exercise for the

429
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.790
David Schaich (he): A, some distinguishable particles.

430
00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.620
David Schaich (he): So

431
00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:40.180
David Schaich (he): here we go back to our illustration of this process. We imagine that we can

432
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:45.320
David Schaich (he): each of these particles labels ABC.

433
00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:50.040
David Schaich (he): The E. And F. And keep track of how they

434
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:56.950
David Schaich (he): Which of these particles is, which, as they balance around it' be because over there

435
00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:01.110
David Schaich (he): is over there. F is over there. and

436
00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.740
David Schaich (he): once we re insert the wall, it will.

437
00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:15.130
David Schaich (he): we will re insert it at just a certain time, where you can expect a similar number of particles to be

438
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:17.620
David Schaich (he): on either side of them all to be reinforced.

439
00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:21.240
David Schaich (he): But there's no need for any of the labels to

440
00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.670
that.

441
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.120
David Schaich (he): And now we on different size.

442
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:35.780
David Schaich (he): So what entropies do we get in this case?

443
00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:41.650
David Schaich (he): Going through the similar sort of calculation now with

444
00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:48.600
David Schaich (he): do you distinguishable entropy

445
00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:52.160
David Schaich (he): coming in it' be in the same for one

446
00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:56.380
David Schaich (he): We got a factor of 3 halves and the 2 cancelling off.

447
00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:08.050
David Schaich (he): and then 2 and i'm the one of we over the landing cube. It's no factor in the log rhythm

448
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:11.300
David Schaich (he): in the combined system.

449
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:17.120
David Schaich (he): We have just a single with

450
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:24.520
David Schaich (he): 2 n and 2 be particles at the same temperature. So 3 halves times 2, and

451
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:28.630
David Schaich (he): plus that 2 n times the of 2 V

452
00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:33.670
David Schaich (he): over. cute it. and if we

453
00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:37.460
David Schaich (he): and i'll take the difference of those 2 expressions

454
00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:50.010
David Schaich (he): going by the entropy later in time. minus the initial entropy. we started off with the 3 ends cancel. and

455
00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:57.420
David Schaich (he): we can break out that log into a sum of logs, and all of those will cancel, except for that log of 2

456
00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:04.590
David Schaich (he): that we have in the case of Fc. But not in the case of

457
00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.700
David Schaich (he): so

458
00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:14.090
David Schaich (he): the difference between the entropy, as time goes on is now non-zero level.

459
00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:23.770
David Schaich (he): and, in fact, it is strictly positive, and it grows linearly with the number of particles and this becomes a very large number like 10 to the power 23

460
00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.420
David Schaich (he): systems, with that

461
00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.920
David Schaich (he): reasonable number of degrees of freedom. And

462
00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:40.230
David Schaich (he): you refer to this non-zero difference between the combined entropy

463
00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:47.450
David Schaich (he): at the interview of the initial set as this mixing energy mixing entropy.

464
00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:53.260
David Schaich (he): don't say S. Some mix, and this, of course, is also

465
00:43:54.780 --> 00:44:00.800
David Schaich (he): consistent with the second ball. In fact, it's maybe the what we

466
00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:09.190
David Schaich (he): with an expected. Without doing the calculation we expect the entropy to increase this time goes on, except in very special

467
00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:13.520
David Schaich (he): circumstances that involve those reversible processes.

468
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:34.760
David Schaich (he): Now, if we go back to the exercise of separating things. we, you take that same approximation that the entropy will be effectively all accounting for by.

469
00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:39.480
David Schaich (he): and a prime equal to. and B prime.

470
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:46.040
David Schaich (he): But even number of particles on either side of the role in the we separated the system

471
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:48.380
David Schaich (he): that gives us, as above.

472
00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:54.360
David Schaich (he): the final entropy. s a prime plus Sb. Prime, which was equal to

473
00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:57.100
David Schaich (he): the initial entropy, and

474
00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.890
David Schaich (he): therefore less than the entropy of the combined system.

475
00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:05.870
David Schaich (he): So

476
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:16.510
David Schaich (he): this argument is violating the second law of thermodynamics. It appears that the entropy has

477
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:19.190
David Schaich (he): decreased, as time is going on.

478
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:25.610
David Schaich (he): entropy in the final state s to be prime plus a prime. It's less than

479
00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:30.470
David Schaich (he): that in the middle stage of this 3 stage process.

480
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:36.830
David Schaich (he): and this observation

481
00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:43.440
David Schaich (he): it was under the name of the gives paradox.

482
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:53.350
David Schaich (he): Why is this analysis giving us a violation of the second law of thermodynamics? Can say, this? Is it

483
00:45:55.710 --> 00:46:00.130
David Schaich (he): hope that gives paradox gives himself Not confused about this, he actually explained

484
00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:02.940
David Schaich (he): why there is no paradox, and

485
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:12.620
David Schaich (he): we'll get to that explanation after a usual break pick up in 10 min, just a minute or 2 before

486
00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:16.060
David Schaich (he): the hour the check. Before I pause the

487
00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:28.130
David Schaich (he): recording. You stretch your legs whether they're all right. Any questions about we mixing entropy the calculations you go through the

488
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:31.750
David Schaich (he): second half of the first half of today's lecture.

489
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:51.710
David Schaich (he): not seeing any. I'll get that. Okay, I think we can he's going again and resume with the

490
00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:54.260
David Schaich (he): resolution of this

491
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:57.070
David Schaich (he): a parent paradox. And

492
00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.510
David Schaich (he): so I already gave away the

493
00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:08.400
David Schaich (he): key piece of information right going through this picture of the 3 stage process. and

494
00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:14.360
David Schaich (he): showing how the

495
00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:20.910
David Schaich (he): labels that we now have on the distinguishable particles can shift around and differ

496
00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:27.480
David Schaich (he): in the final. We separated systems compared to the original ones that we started off.

497
00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:32.850
David Schaich (he): So the key that you could see from that

498
00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.940
David Schaich (he): is that at least in the case

499
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:38.200
David Schaich (he): of distinguishable particles

500
00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:45.250
David Schaich (he): in any given distribution of particles. We have

501
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:51.430
David Schaich (he): more information. then just the

502
00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:54.350
David Schaich (he): article number in a.

503
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.830
David Schaich (he): and then be from. We do expect.

504
00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:00.950
David Schaich (he): based on les. There's this tutorial

505
00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:06.090
David Schaich (he): n a prime, and it be prime to be roughly equal and equal to N.

506
00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:17.750
David Schaich (he): That's dominates the number of possible microstates that we have. but for each of those distributions of particles and even number on

507
00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.270
David Schaich (he): you saw it.

508
00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:24.150
David Schaich (he): There are many ways of distributing the labels.

509
00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:29.550
David Schaich (he): in addition to just the number of particles. and it's a stable that we have

510
00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:32.240
David Schaich (he): only in the

511
00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:37.980
David Schaich (he): and not be in the sociable one. so that gives us many more

512
00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:42.160
David Schaich (he): microstates

513
00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:47.580
David Schaich (he): with different labels.

514
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:55.000
David Schaich (he): and when I say more, i'm responding to more compared to

515
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.810
David Schaich (he): the initial cell

516
00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.620
David Schaich (he): that the system

517
00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:08.170
David Schaich (he): a plus b, that we had at first, where there was a particular labeling ABC. Dvds in that figure.

518
00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.370
David Schaich (he): and it was a number of microstates.

519
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:16.750
David Schaich (he): as we've seen, both micro canonically and canonically

520
00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:21.180
David Schaich (he): gives us larger entropy

521
00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.570
David Schaich (he): s a prime

522
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:29.330
David Schaich (he): plus sv prime. At the end of this process

523
00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:31.690
David Schaich (he): he is greater than S. A.

524
00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:38.420
David Schaich (he): That is a certainly a necessary

525
00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:43.520
David Schaich (he): mission, or the second law of thermodynamics to hold as we go through all stages.

526
00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:48.070
David Schaich (he): it's not sufficient. We also need to check that.

527
00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:54.770
David Schaich (he): It would be a Sav. S. A prime plus S. B. Prime. is

528
00:49:56.100 --> 00:50:01.900
David Schaich (he): greater than the interview of the combined system. Sc. So that's

529
00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:08.470
David Schaich (he): in accordance with the second of all, the entropy keeps increasing through each stage of this process as time goes on.

530
00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:17.090
David Schaich (he): and it is possible to hurry out if you corrected and you were careful population

531
00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:25.490
David Schaich (he): that's ends up, confirming that

532
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:34.770
David Schaich (he): is at least Fc. And possibly larger than.

533
00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:40.300
David Schaich (he): and probably in this week's tutorial. On Thursday morning a few days

534
00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:43.020
David Schaich (he): we will consider the

535
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:48.790
David Schaich (he): simplified case of this calculation.

536
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:53.460
David Schaich (he): where. instead of

537
00:50:53.820 --> 00:51:01.300
David Schaich (he): supposing that all end particles are completely distinguishable from each other, will break up the particles into

538
00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:02.500
David Schaich (he): 2 cents.

539
00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:12.230
David Schaich (he): say one will set it red particles and one set of new particles that can be distinguished across those different sets, but not within each individual set.

540
00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:21.940
David Schaich (he): You can see that the second law of thermodynamics holds, and that there is no paradox in general. Whenever you think you found a paradox.

541
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:25.770
David Schaich (he): and if they sign that they're simply doing something wrong.

542
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:30.790
David Schaich (he): And the question is, what which can be a very interesting way to clarify

543
00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:42.530
David Schaich (he): what the proper way of analyzing these typical situations in terms of that that really is. As I said, you showed how there is no paradox or slightly unfair

544
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:49.560
David Schaich (he): that this is called a gives paradox. What we do see here in this case

545
00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:50.550
David Schaich (he): is.

546
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:57.180
David Schaich (he): yeah, it's due to all of the different labels that we can have in that

547
00:51:57.350 --> 00:52:04.800
David Schaich (he): final setup after we re inserted the role, and we separated systems compared to the original one. Is that

548
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:15.330
David Schaich (he): going through this process with distinguishable particles. there's essentially 0 chance. I'm getting back to

549
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.330
David Schaich (he): yeah

550
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:24.200
David Schaich (he): original. distinguishable system

551
00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.920
David Schaich (he): in which we had

552
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:33.910
David Schaich (he): particular labels on particular signs of those 2 subsystems.

553
00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.210
David Schaich (he): And

554
00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:38.720
David Schaich (he): what this is to say is that

555
00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:48.660
David Schaich (he): this 3 saves process in this case cannot be reversed. We don't get back to where we started, so it's not like opening and closing the door between 2

556
00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:52.940
David Schaich (he): gases of air made up of indistinguishable molecules.

557
00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.740
David Schaich (he): and accordingly, to the irreversibility

558
00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:03.630
David Schaich (he): of this process.

559
00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.930
David Schaich (he): the entropy of the universe

560
00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:15.710
David Schaich (he): for the interview of the system just in isolation which is part of the universe increases

561
00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:28.550
David Schaich (he): as we go through all of these stages. So that is the mixing energy of the gears paradox and its resolution. No. Now move on to

562
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:43.070
David Schaich (he): the ideal gas law and start building up toward thermodynamic cycles. Are there any questions about mixing entropy or this paradox? And some of his information between distinguishable and indistinguishable particles. Before we

563
00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.370
David Schaich (he): change gears slightly.

564
00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:02.190
David Schaich (he): Not seeing any, I'll draw a line under that. and

565
00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:05.750
David Schaich (he): step back to

566
00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:13.450
David Schaich (he): our starting point for all of these analysis in the canonical ensemble.

567
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.020
David Schaich (he): which is the partition function.

568
00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:29.900
David Schaich (he): I'll again go back to the case in this initial articles, which turns out to be a generally in general, the physically more relevant one

569
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:31.030
David Schaich (he): else

570
00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:35.900
David Schaich (he): something that we can tell from the different behavior of

571
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:39.870
David Schaich (he): to or particles that most of it.

572
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:42.870
David Schaich (he): Most statistical systems, like

573
00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.350
David Schaich (he): the air in the room.

574
00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:57.380
David Schaich (he): are made up of particles that turn out to be indistinguishable. There's no way to label the oxygen molecule and distinguish it from any other.

575
00:54:57.850 --> 00:55:05.740
David Schaich (he): So this has that one over factorial accounting factor V. Over Lambda cube to the power in.

576
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:09.360
David Schaich (he): and we remarked that

577
00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:14.890
David Schaich (he): the dependence on the volume that feeds through to the entropy it is

578
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:17.620
David Schaich (he): something new in this

579
00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:30.100
David Schaich (he): context is like, and of an ideal gas formulated in a container that we do not have see or spin systems. and as a piece of general terminology, the volume

580
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:35.580
David Schaich (he): in this expression and the entropy

581
00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.560
David Schaich (he): is No.

582
00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:42.670
David Schaich (he): As a control parameter.

583
00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.180
David Schaich (he): It is introduced into the partition function

584
00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:54.280
David Schaich (he): for all our for the micro state energies.

585
00:55:55.160 --> 00:56:07.680
David Schaich (he): Yes. we declared it had to depend on that volume the possible energies that we could have before taking the limit back to continuously bearing momentum and energies.

586
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.800
David Schaich (he): Another example is

587
00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:15.510
David Schaich (he): the external magnetic field H,

588
00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:23.940
David Schaich (he): which is another example of the control for

589
00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:30.500
David Schaich (he): last week and before.

590
00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:42.520
David Schaich (he): And what this terminology is just saying kind of what it says on the team. Things like the volume of a gas, the external magnetic field that we apply to a spin system.

591
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:44.100
David Schaich (he): our parameters that

592
00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:48.160
David Schaich (he): we imagine, at least in principle, we can't control

593
00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:53.870
David Schaich (he): in an experiment which will allow us to

594
00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:56.760
David Schaich (he): observe the

595
00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:01.300
David Schaich (he): response to the system to changes

596
00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:05.820
David Schaich (he): in these parameters, as we very

597
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:17.410
David Schaich (he): the potential complication to observing a responsible system to changes in parameters that we can control is that

598
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:21.080
David Schaich (he): there tend to be several of these parameters.

599
00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:24.780
David Schaich (he): See the volume temperature external.

600
00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:32.190
David Schaich (he): potentially the number of particles of practice that's a bit harder to control. And

601
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:34.920
David Schaich (he): if we want to

602
00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:49.380
David Schaich (he): this entangle the response to any particular one of these control parameters. So, seeing how we behavior of our thermodynamic system.

603
00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:53.140
David Schaich (he): it depends on a given control parameter

604
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:54.520
David Schaich (he): all the

605
00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:57.640
David Schaich (he): others. So the other control parameters

606
00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:05.000
David Schaich (he): you to be fixed and kept constant, as we

607
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:08.610
David Schaich (he): very the one that we're interested in. And we have already seen

608
00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.270
David Schaich (he): examples

609
00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:17.990
David Schaich (he): on this person. The micro canonical case. when we define the inverse temperature

610
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:21.730
David Schaich (he): to be the change in entropy

611
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:28.620
David Schaich (he): with energy, a micro canonical control parameter the energy we imagine we can adjust

612
00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:35.040
David Schaich (he): you had to fix the other conserved quality in the micro canonical context and number of particles.

613
00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:38.260
David Schaich (he): And similarly.

614
00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:46.820
David Schaich (he): a couple of weeks ago, when we introduced the heat capacity. I mentioned that this subscript to be on the key capacity

615
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:55.310
David Schaich (he): meant that it was the heat capacity at a fixed volume. The change in the average internal entropy, and the

616
00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:58.910
David Schaich (he): as we vary, the control parameter of the temperature

617
00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.400
David Schaich (he): with the control parameter volume capture fixed.

618
00:59:03.690 --> 00:59:04.780
David Schaich (he): and

619
00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:10.230
David Schaich (he): we can define a third quantity of this sort.

620
00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:12.220
David Schaich (he): It will be

621
00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.250
David Schaich (he): very interesting in the context of

622
00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:18.530
David Schaich (he): you want to name it. Cycles.

623
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:24.160
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Response in the energy.

624
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:30.380
David Schaich (he): Specifically, the internal energy and the economic ensemble

625
00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:36.260
David Schaich (he): to a change in volume

626
00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:42.880
David Schaich (he): that defines

627
00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:57.910
David Schaich (he): the pressure of the system. call it it's actually the negative of this change. internal energy. It's the boing changes. and

628
01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.330
David Schaich (he): we actually need to be a bit

629
01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:06.660
David Schaich (he): more cautious here and swap out

630
01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.090
David Schaich (he): the you

631
01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:15.610
David Schaich (he): dependence on other control parameters in and

632
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:19.670
David Schaich (he): T. So the number of particles in the temperature

633
01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.490
David Schaich (he): both show up in the entropy.

634
01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:28.630
David Schaich (he): I've been derived last week, and I've been working with you, for example, today.

635
01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.490
David Schaich (he): So by fixing

636
01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:41.320
David Schaich (he): the entropy we get the formal statistical physics definition of the pressure.

637
01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:46.630
David Schaich (he): So I change in the volume

638
01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:49.360
David Schaich (he): we

639
01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.500
David Schaich (he): entropy fix.

640
01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.110
David Schaich (he): i'll mention in passing. I might use terminology for this

641
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.790
David Schaich (he): only. It is in the tropic

642
01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:03.970
David Schaich (he): process. Here

643
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:12.770
David Schaich (he): the entropy goes into the isotropic part of that. and Isos is coming from the Greek word for equal. It was

644
01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:19.270
David Schaich (he): the process that takes us between 2 canonical systems with a different volume, but equal entropy

645
01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:28.810
David Schaich (he): and 4, you know, gases we're currently focusing on. We have seen

646
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.710
David Schaich (he): that the entropy s depends on

647
01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.550
David Schaich (he): the combination

648
01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:43.330
David Schaich (he): of the volume. Times. This thermal definitely the minus 3 power.

649
01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:48.980
David Schaich (he): which is volume times temperature to the 3 halves.

650
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:51.690
David Schaich (he): Just next to

651
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:53.920
David Schaich (he): do you

652
01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.790
David Schaich (he): Dependence of

653
01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.700
David Schaich (he): the

654
01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:11.370
David Schaich (he): it was like one over the square root of the temperature. so rearranging that.

655
01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:18.360
David Schaich (he): or, you know, gases the condition of constant entropy

656
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:25.050
David Schaich (he): just requires this constant relation

657
01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.850
David Schaich (he): between the volume of the system and

658
01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:33.820
David Schaich (he): the 3 have power.

659
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:36.950
David Schaich (he): Oh, it's temperature.

660
01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.780
David Schaich (he): So if we

661
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:58.070
David Schaich (he): improve this. you say that B times t to the 3 over 2 is equal to some constant. and

662
01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:03.680
David Schaich (he): if I told you what to come, I would call this constant c. To the power free has.

663
01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:04.710
David Schaich (he): then

664
01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.950
David Schaich (he): I can rearrange this to find

665
01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:16.090
David Schaich (he): how the temperature has to change. As we carry out this change in the control parameter of the volume and look at the response

666
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:18.230
David Schaich (he): of the average internal entropy.

667
01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:21.960
David Schaich (he): So average internal energy with fixed entropy

668
01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:25.850
David Schaich (he): Okay, so two-thirds power of both sides.

669
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:41.950
David Schaich (he): You saw last week that the average internal energy it's 3 halves, and T, which, if we impose, causes entry for you. means that we have it. Some constants, 3 c. Over 2

670
01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:44.160
David Schaich (he): times env to the power of

671
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:47.710
David Schaich (he): sorry. This is a minus two-thirds.

672
01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:50.470
David Schaich (he): divided by the on both sides

673
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:59.560
David Schaich (he): and b to the power, minus two-thirds. and then taking that derivative after having a pose.

674
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.770
David Schaich (he): the constant entropy condition that gets us

675
01:04:02.890 --> 01:04:05.660
David Schaich (he): the expression for the energy in this form.

676
01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:09.170
David Schaich (he): we have a negative sign from the derivative

677
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:13.250
David Schaich (he): house, and 3 C has comes out as this accounts to end.

678
01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:24.180
David Schaich (he): Yeah derivative of D to the minus two-thirds with respect to that volume is a factor of minus two-thirds. and then

679
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:34.690
David Schaich (he): into the minus 5 thirds. We bring it down on the power of the volume from the derivative rearrange that some of those constants cancel up

680
01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.350
David Schaich (he): we have.

681
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:40.920
David Schaich (he): and over the times that remaining, c.

682
01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:49.580
David Schaich (he): To the power of the the power line is two-thirds. We can recognize as the temperature

683
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:54.460
David Schaich (he): all divided by the so we can

684
01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:00.830
David Schaich (he): rearrange. To put this in a forum.

685
01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.020
David Schaich (he): You may well have seen before

686
01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:10.530
David Schaich (he): That' be pressure of the ideal Gas Times. The volume that it is in

687
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:17.150
David Schaich (he): is equal to the number of particles that is composed of multiplied by their temperature.

688
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:20.010
David Schaich (he): This is known

689
01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:27.000
David Schaich (he): as the hiding the gas law. and we have derived it from

690
01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:31.500
David Schaich (he): our new definition of pressure, as the isotropic response

691
01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.460
David Schaich (he): of the internal energy to a change in the volume

692
01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.810
David Schaich (he): of an ideal.

693
01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:53.350
David Schaich (he): and

694
01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:59.070
David Schaich (he): it's deciding what

695
01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:09.120
David Schaich (he): just whether to make any comments about what it means to change the temperature in economic ensemble. That's something I think we can put off until we get to

696
01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:11.310
David Schaich (he): thermodynamic cycles and just appears

697
01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:17.800
David Schaich (he): Instead, we can generalize this concept of the ideal gas law.

698
01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:28.170
David Schaich (he): This is really an example, or in realization of a more general

699
01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.950
David Schaich (he): concept. what is called

700
01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:36.900
David Schaich (he): an equation of state.

701
01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:43.470
David Schaich (he): So the ideal gas law is the equation of States for

702
01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:48.810
David Schaich (he): a classical, non-relativistic, non-interacting ideal gas

703
01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:52.440
David Schaich (he): and the state

704
01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:55.450
David Schaich (he): and it is being referred to here

705
01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:56.500
David Schaich (he): is

706
01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:01.070
David Schaich (he): not to the microstates that we start at all.

707
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:07.750
David Schaich (he): Our derivation with our analysis is based on yeah behavior of

708
01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:11.640
David Schaich (he): individual particles, microscopic degrees of freedom.

709
01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:20.540
David Schaich (he): From that we are. You have to rise to large scale behavior of these systems what

710
01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:24.870
David Schaich (he): we could call a macro stage rather than a microstate

711
01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:26.100
David Schaich (he): for

712
01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:31.250
David Schaich (he): a thermodynamic state.

713
01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:43.810
David Schaich (he): So what the equations of seeds are in general. It says, we can see in the example of the ideal as well

714
01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:45.480
David Schaich (he): all this

715
01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.910
David Schaich (he): Eos.

716
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.240
David Schaich (he): So equations of State.

717
01:07:57.110 --> 01:08:01.190
David Schaich (he): Our relations between use large scale.

718
01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.530
David Schaich (he): macroscopic properties

719
01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.350
David Schaich (he): of

720
01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:17.180
David Schaich (he): statistical systems which emerge from the underlying dynamics of

721
01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:22.970
David Schaich (he): this enormous number of the reason freedom that we have avoided dealing with explicitly

722
01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:27.069
David Schaich (he): through our

723
01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:32.029
David Schaich (he): the source of properties that we have in mind are things like Oh, that pressure

724
01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:37.450
David Schaich (he): volume that we can see the ideal gas law of

725
01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:41.990
David Schaich (he): the temperature.

726
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.920
David Schaich (he): even the internal energy.

727
01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:52.569
David Schaich (he): So, from the complicated dynamics of

728
01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:54.600
David Schaich (he): an enormous number of

729
01:08:54.609 --> 01:08:58.090
David Schaich (he): degrees of freedom, typically atoms or molecules.

730
01:08:58.149 --> 01:09:04.319
David Schaich (he): we have actually arrived extraordinarily simple relations between

731
01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:08.370
David Schaich (he): these easily observable, easily measurable.

732
01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:11.750
David Schaich (he): or to scale problems. So

733
01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:18.189
David Schaich (he): you've been that sort of situation. It's natural to sort of look at the

734
01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:21.319
David Schaich (he): historical development of

735
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:27.620
David Schaich (he): in the field of physics, aerodynamics, and statistical physics. And

736
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:44.590
David Schaich (he): what you may already be aware of this and historically. these relations described by the equations of things. we're observed empirically

737
01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:48.569
David Schaich (he): the user

738
01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:57.270
David Schaich (he): one before they could be mathematically derived from statistical physics.

739
01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:05.340
David Schaich (he): You know that's the earliest example that

740
01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:16.610
David Schaich (he): at least the last time one of these relations was discovered for the first time was

741
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:22.320
David Schaich (he): Robert Boyle. in the

742
01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:27.160
David Schaich (he): 1,600 sixtys, who carried out experiments

743
01:10:27.230 --> 01:10:28.260
David Schaich (he): where

744
01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:34.540
David Schaich (he): pressure of a gas.

745
01:10:38.010 --> 01:10:44.830
David Schaich (he): keeping its number of particles fixed as well as keeping it temperature fixed.

746
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:47.850
David Schaich (he): And he observed

747
01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.940
David Schaich (he): that the product of Pressure Times volume

748
01:10:56.190 --> 01:11:00.460
David Schaich (he): pressure, changed. You solve the volume changing in the opposite way.

749
01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:07.760
David Schaich (he): Larger pressure produces smaller volume. Less pressure allow the system to expand, producing a larger volume.

750
01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:09.050
David Schaich (he): and

751
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:16.850
David Schaich (he): this relation, which certainly have been discovered by other people in other parts of the world. But

752
01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:25.490
David Schaich (he): it entered the scientific literature that we still have from oil, and eventually became known as boil as well.

753
01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:30.300
David Schaich (he): That's around that, just to recognize that

754
01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:36.350
David Schaich (he): it wasn't something unique to to boil it. Just sort of gets the sort of credit for it

755
01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:43.380
David Schaich (he): whether that's fully deserved or not. These sorts of laws at that time.

756
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:50.840
David Schaich (he): almost 400 years ago. work sort of empirical observations that

757
01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:55.780
David Schaich (he): people were making and recording and cataloging about the natural world.

758
01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:57.500
David Schaich (he): So this is the same

759
01:11:57.510 --> 01:12:01.760
David Schaich (he): sort of wall that the first and second walls of the of the dynamics came from.

760
01:12:02.050 --> 01:12:03.670
David Schaich (he): which we've also been now

761
01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:07.680
David Schaich (he): able to derive from statistical physics analysis.

762
01:12:09.850 --> 01:12:10.920
David Schaich (he): and

763
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:14.010
David Schaich (he): over the

764
01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:19.490
David Schaich (he): following: a few centuries, and especially during the Industrial Revolution.

765
01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.460
David Schaich (he): several similar relations were down.

766
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:28.650
David Schaich (he): Problem similar sorts of experiments.

767
01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.930
David Schaich (he): How are you out and experiments

768
01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:36.990
David Schaich (he): fixing the number of particles and the pressure?

769
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:44.710
David Schaich (he): And if we then vary the temperature, we find that a water gas expands, a cooler gas contracts

770
01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:47.460
David Schaich (he): the ratio of pulling the temperature.

771
01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:50.320
David Schaich (he): Is it constant?

772
01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:52.580
David Schaich (he): Yeah, this

773
01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.060
David Schaich (he): it's called Charles as well.

774
01:12:58.150 --> 01:13:03.790
David Schaich (he): giving credit to a fellow who is working in the right 17 properties.

775
01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:10.370
David Schaich (he): I think we fix the number of particles and the volume that they are in.

776
01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.410
David Schaich (he): and imagine heating it up or cooling it down. Then.

777
01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:17.100
David Schaich (he): if the volume is not allowed to fix it, the pressure that gets

778
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:22.270
David Schaich (he): higher and higher temperatures, the pressure decreases the lower temperatures.

779
01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:26.590
David Schaich (he): This okay, known as

780
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:34.540
David Schaich (he): it's the stop. So i'm not making it a serious attempt to pronounce these names correctly. It was

781
01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.480
David Schaich (he): about 2015 years after Charles as well.

782
01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:43.180
David Schaich (he): and just 10 years after that. people consider fixing the

783
01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:47.910
David Schaich (he): pressure and the temperature, but varying the number of particles.

784
01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:55.300
David Schaich (he): and seeing that the volume they occupied, and they fixed pressure and temperature.

785
01:13:57.450 --> 01:14:00.400
David Schaich (he): varying directly with the number of particles.

786
01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:07.780
David Schaich (he): This is credited historically to

787
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:12.600
David Schaich (he): the same

788
01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:15.160
David Schaich (he): large number is named after.

789
01:14:16.650 --> 01:14:27.930
David Schaich (he): and we can recognize that all of these relations which were initially observed it purely through experiments, are different aspects of

790
01:14:28.150 --> 01:14:31.420
David Schaich (he): our ideal gas law.

791
01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:34.360
David Schaich (he): You, divided by T. Is P. Divided by N.

792
01:14:34.710 --> 01:14:35.930
David Schaich (he): Which was fixed

793
01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:43.900
David Schaich (he): P. Divided by T. Is divided by V, which was fixed. We divided by N. It's. P. Divided by team also fixed.

794
01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:51.080
David Schaich (he): You can. You can make it nice cartoon of this dividing out

795
01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:55.240
David Schaich (he): T. Times in from the Pressure Times volume

796
01:14:55.340 --> 01:15:03.730
David Schaich (he): you get a costing factor. unic aversion factor between units of temperature and energy which we have set equal to each other. So K. B. Equals one.

797
01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:07.920
David Schaich (he): What those law from the 16 hundreds.

798
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:14.330
David Schaich (he): What's that? Pressure Times volume is a constant when temperature particle number is fixed.

799
01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:18.080
David Schaich (he): and the other 3 laws

800
01:15:18.130 --> 01:15:23.890
David Schaich (he): all right. Other combinations of these 4 parameters that are related

801
01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:27.610
David Schaich (he): by the ideal gas or the equation of State

802
01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:29.910
David Schaich (he): for ideal gases.

803
01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.050
David Schaich (he): and it actually took a

804
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:38.920
David Schaich (he): a few decades for people to look at those

805
01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:43.490
David Schaich (he): 4 or more relations between

806
01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:55.710
David Schaich (he): we, those macroscopic quantities, the pressure going, temperature, and particle number, and actually realize that they could all be expressed as that single relation.

807
01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:59.860
David Schaich (he): So these sorts of empirical walls

808
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:06.850
David Schaich (he): to buy into the ideal cap small

809
01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:11.760
David Schaich (he): in the eighteen-

810
01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:13.830
David Schaich (he): so

811
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:18.380
David Schaich (he): decades or in some cases centuries after they have been initially observed.

812
01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:19.330
David Schaich (he): and

813
01:16:23.690 --> 01:16:26.770
David Schaich (he): you see historical credit for that.

814
01:16:27.570 --> 01:16:33.050
David Schaich (he): But this is still one of these empirical laws at the level of observation rather than

815
01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:37.680
David Schaich (he): fundamental mathematical derivation. and that derivation from

816
01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:40.890
David Schaich (he): statistical physics, showing

817
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:42.980
David Schaich (he): probably ideally as well.

818
01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.900
David Schaich (he): A rose is a consequence of

819
01:16:50.090 --> 01:17:00.190
David Schaich (he): hypothesizing the existence of a large number of atoms or molecules in all of these gases that we're being and and experimentally studied.

820
01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:03.500
David Schaich (he): That was first done.

821
01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:08.080
David Schaich (he): at least in the historical record in the 1850 S. Independently by

822
01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:13.170
David Schaich (he): a couple of folks currently, and I was Yes.

823
01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:22.730
David Schaich (he): and that was one of the initial successes of

824
01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:27.990
David Schaich (he): statistical physics, the atomic hypothesis that these gases that have been

825
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:32.550
David Schaich (he): empirically studied. how many years we're actually made up of

826
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:37.840
David Schaich (he): a large number of independent degrees of freedom called the atoms or molecules

827
01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:43.680
David Schaich (he): can be analyzed the way we have been analyzing them over the past few weeks.

828
01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:47.350
David Schaich (he): The mid 18 hundreds was

829
01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:53.360
David Schaich (he): to the launching points for that whole enterprise of statistical physics. It was not

830
01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:58.460
David Schaich (he): universally accepted as the truth for many years after that, as we discussed

831
01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:02.970
David Schaich (he): just the very first lecture of the term.

832
01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:10.720
David Schaich (he): But it was. This was one of the pieces of evidence showing that there was something

833
01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:16.520
David Schaich (he): significant to the mathematical level in the statistical description.

834
01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:17.740
David Schaich (he): Oh, okay.

835
01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:22.720
David Schaich (he): macroscopic systems in terms of microscopic atomic degrees of freedom.

836
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:25.970
David Schaich (he): But one

837
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:29.170
David Schaich (he): things to know here, before

838
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:35.160
David Schaich (he): you put it into this and move on to the the next topic is

839
01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:40.570
David Schaich (he): that from the initial work from the 16 hundreds.

840
01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:50.480
David Schaich (he): after a sort of long price bill, there was a rapid succession of both theoretical and experimental advances starting

841
01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:59.180
David Schaich (he): in the late 1,700 Isn't, going into the first half of the nineteenth century. which coincided

842
01:19:01.210 --> 01:19:02.440
David Schaich (he): with the

843
01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.630
David Schaich (he): Industrial Revolution.

844
01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:15.090
David Schaich (he): and the fact that

845
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:18.900
David Schaich (he): the pace of

846
01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:26.960
David Schaich (he): advances in understanding of statistical physics and physics in general accelerated during that industrial revolution

847
01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:28.020
David Schaich (he): is

848
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:31.120
David Schaich (he): not a coincidence in.

849
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.720
David Schaich (he): I know this is maybe getting a bit

850
01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:38.130
David Schaich (he): more historical than mathematical at the moment.

851
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:40.810
David Schaich (he): I think it's worth appreciating

852
01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.640
David Schaich (he): the way that mathematical advances

853
01:19:43.770 --> 01:19:45.880
David Schaich (he): and become part

854
01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:49.530
David Schaich (he): of a virtuous cycle of

855
01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:56.960
David Schaich (he): industrial progress, combined with insight into the the mathematics

856
01:19:58.410 --> 01:19:59.730
David Schaich (he): that is

857
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:03.930
David Schaich (he): underlying, or at the heart of all of the

858
01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:09.390
David Schaich (he): applications, that. or driving the economy.

859
01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:22.100
David Schaich (he): And this is a virtuous cycle that continues today in different forms. Many of them centered around computing data science. It was like you explored in that computer project

860
01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.960
David Schaich (he): back in the 18 hundreds that was

861
01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:28.150
David Schaich (he): not always under consideration.

862
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:35.150
David Schaich (he): You might know that one of the drivers of industrial progress.

863
01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:38.200
David Schaich (he): the automation and construction of factories

864
01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:43.390
David Schaich (he): and replacement of human labor. With machine labor was the development of

865
01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:50.820
David Schaich (he): various sorts of efficient engines that could convert

866
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:58.140
David Schaich (he): if they could do productive things, productive work out of

867
01:20:59.890 --> 01:21:00.930
David Schaich (he): energy.

868
01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:08.200
David Schaich (he): So it's connecting to some of the topics that we have been discussing, and will, in fact, be

869
01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:12.980
David Schaich (he): our next major application of economical ensemble to

870
01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:17.840
David Schaich (he): key engines. thermodynamic cycles that can take

871
01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:22.110
David Schaich (he): keep to internal energy and use it to do work

872
01:21:22.190 --> 01:21:28.050
David Schaich (he): on the surroundings. So you have Yeah, another

873
01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:35.140
David Schaich (he): 1015 min today to get started building up toward the thermodynamic cycles of heat engines.

874
01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:41.110
David Schaich (he): Before doing so i'll pause briefly to see if there are questions about the ideal gas law.

875
01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:46.950
David Schaich (he): or or any of this historical stuff. And one

876
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:52.830
David Schaich (he): consider whether everything is clear. I will say, just be wary that

877
01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:54.900
David Schaich (he): this sort of

878
01:21:56.630 --> 01:21:59.180
David Schaich (he): superficial history is.

879
01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:03.040
David Schaich (he): you know, like gross simplification of what was actually going on.

880
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:05.750
David Schaich (he): The true story is

881
01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:10.270
David Schaich (he): much more complicated and much more interesting, and is reflected by

882
01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:15.800
David Schaich (he): decades, long gaps between a lot of these relations that

883
01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:24.890
David Schaich (he): you know we can see as sort of immediate consequences of statistical physics that we understand today. It was in the process of

884
01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:27.430
David Schaich (he): being figured out. and it

885
01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:31.270
David Schaich (he): I should not get the impression that it was a

886
01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:32.830
David Schaich (he): straightforward

887
01:22:33.150 --> 01:22:38.600
David Schaich (he): marked a trial by the people who I have names here I can get credit for

888
01:22:40.410 --> 01:22:44.590
David Schaich (he): publishing things in their final form, as they've come down to us today.

889
01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:53.330
David Schaich (he): so enough about history, less get back to economical ensemble. and

890
01:22:54.980 --> 01:23:07.760
David Schaich (he): next to me. pressure that we have just to find the isentropic response of the internal energy of a canonical system to a change in this volume.

891
01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:14.410
David Schaich (he): We have this idea from everyday experience of pressure as

892
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:15.440
David Schaich (he): Hey.

893
01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:18.040
David Schaich (he): through the mechanical properties.

894
01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:22.610
David Schaich (he): Okay, alluded to when discussing these past laws.

895
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:28.140
David Schaich (he): So in deriving, I've got those small.

896
01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:34.290
David Schaich (he): Okay. increasing the pressure. Sorry

897
01:23:34.630 --> 01:23:42.650
David Schaich (he): Looking at the socks, and we increase the pressure on a gas. We saw that temperature rose. We have the idea that

898
01:23:42.730 --> 01:23:44.840
David Schaich (he): increasing the pressure.

899
01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:48.950
David Schaich (he): squeezing some application of the force

900
01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:53.440
David Schaich (he): to the system, a mechanical process that we want to

901
01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:59.240
David Schaich (he): ensure that our

902
01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:05.470
David Schaich (he): statistical physics definition in terms of a response function is

903
01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:13.560
David Schaich (he): wide with it, makes sense in terms of the chemical processes that we may be more familiar with in the context of

904
01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:14.530
David Schaich (he): pressure.

905
01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.920
David Schaich (he): So we can do this connection by

906
01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:29.310
David Schaich (he): relate the pressure to the work that is done by a force.

907
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:42.860
David Schaich (he): So i'll call that force. Yeah. say that it is defined at some position are both of those are vectors in three-dimensional space. X, Y. And Z.

908
01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:44.430
David Schaich (he): And

909
01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:54.570
David Schaich (he): the definition of the work that is done by a force calling back to something hopefully. You seen possibly many years ago

910
01:24:55.530 --> 01:24:56.950
David Schaich (he): on that force

911
01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:01.520
David Schaich (he): changes the

912
01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:06.950
David Schaich (he): energy of an object

913
01:25:09.710 --> 01:25:17.830
David Schaich (he): at that position are by just placing it by some small shift

914
01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:30.130
David Schaich (he): which I call. and if it accessible, Dr. And if an accessible 3, vector so at the infinitesimal.

915
01:25:35.550 --> 01:25:41.500
David Schaich (he): and it's definitely the work that is done. the infinitesimal change in energy.

916
01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.570
David Schaich (he): the inner product of

917
01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:45.670
David Schaich (he): 4 times this

918
01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:48.070
David Schaich (he): displacement. So we get a

919
01:25:48.130 --> 01:25:53.480
David Schaich (he): simple number out of the dot product with those 2 vectors

920
01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:55.980
David Schaich (he): and

921
01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:02.760
David Schaich (he): for macroscopic forces and the changes in

922
01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:06.270
David Schaich (he): position this generalizes to

923
01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:12.690
David Schaich (he): the work being equal to the overall change in energy as we integrate

924
01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:22.200
David Schaich (he): along the displacement dotted into the force that is applied as a function of that position.

925
01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:23.720
David Schaich (he): So this is

926
01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:29.950
David Schaich (he): line integral. It traces all Chris's out the path

927
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:40.960
David Schaich (he): of that product. Taking me in inner product. so traces the path of the object, taking the inner product at every point.

928
01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:45.120
David Schaich (he): just to

929
01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:59.270
David Schaich (he): consider it a simple example not connected to statistical physics, but something may well have seen in the past to recall this way of looking at

930
01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:02.300
David Schaich (he): work in force and energy.

931
01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:13.110
David Schaich (he): which is still a set statistical physics assigned for a couple of minutes. And look at the example of a single object.

932
01:27:14.670 --> 01:27:16.230
David Schaich (he): Again, it falls

933
01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:21.660
David Schaich (he): due to the force of gravity

934
01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.430
David Schaich (he): which we can represent as

935
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:33.900
David Schaich (he): a force that is pointing downward in the Z direction

936
01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:44.270
David Schaich (he): equal to the mass of the object times. The gravitational cost 9.8 meters per second squared negative slide, indicating that it's parting downward.

937
01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.550
David Schaich (he): So if we

938
01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:50.750
David Schaich (he): start this object

939
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:53.610
David Schaich (he): at rest, which

940
01:27:53.710 --> 01:28:00.150
David Schaich (he): means that it's initial kinetic energy is just 0.

941
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:03.650
David Schaich (he): I of H.

942
01:28:04.810 --> 01:28:07.510
David Schaich (he): Then the

943
01:28:10.030 --> 01:28:12.920
David Schaich (he): vital energy here that we have

944
01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:26.570
David Schaich (he): it is just going to be equal to that work that is done on the particle by the force of gravity as it falls.

945
01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:30.430
David Schaich (he): Yeah, work. Remember the change in

946
01:28:31.810 --> 01:28:33.430
David Schaich (he): energy. So

947
01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:39.940
David Schaich (he): the final energy minus the initial energy initial energy. Here is 0,

948
01:28:40.030 --> 01:28:41.540
David Schaich (he): and we have it

949
01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:49.650
David Schaich (he): a fairly simple dot product and line integral integral to compute

950
01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:53.630
David Schaich (he): the X and Y components all drop out.

951
01:28:54.420 --> 01:29:00.390
David Schaich (he): We have an energy that an object that starts with some type age. Let it fall. It just drops down

952
01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:04.470
David Schaich (he): to the ground down the height 0,

953
01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:08.220
David Schaich (he): and we pull out a minus

954
01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:10.440
David Schaich (he): Mg. From the force.

955
01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:16.270
David Schaich (he): and then have the integral from height, page down to 0. Just of

956
01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:19.890
David Schaich (he): the are the Z. That direction which is.

957
01:29:21.090 --> 01:29:27.940
David Schaich (he): which is about the simplest integral you can do. There's a negative sign just from the order of integration limits.

958
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:39.060
David Schaich (he): so we find that the final energy is Mass Times Gravitational Constants Times, the initial heights started from, which is a positive number

959
01:29:40.630 --> 01:29:47.990
David Schaich (he): that corresponds to the positive momentum for momentum in the z component

960
01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:53.870
David Schaich (he): that the object has. Once it hits the ground at height, 0. So the energy

961
01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:56.690
David Schaich (he): Mg. H equals

962
01:29:57.990 --> 01:30:05.120
David Schaich (he): momentum squared over 2. You can solve that for the momentum or the velocity

963
01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:09.470
David Schaich (he): that the we'll mention

964
01:30:10.010 --> 01:30:22.540
David Schaich (he): at the end of this process is pointing downward. When we take the square root we get the positive and negative roots. We know that the object is moving downward from the setup.

965
01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:27.030
David Schaich (he): and this minus M Times Twog. H is

966
01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:39.890
David Schaich (he): Hey, you famous results for the momentum of a polling object. Yes. you probably have seen before. You may not be called it after the number of years that have passed.

967
01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:47.000
David Schaich (he): So that is just a reminder of how work and energy are connected.

968
01:30:47.130 --> 01:30:48.090
David Schaich (he): and

969
01:30:49.290 --> 01:30:54.520
David Schaich (he): we will wrapped up by coming back to

970
01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:01.150
David Schaich (he): statistical systems

971
01:31:04.150 --> 01:31:07.640
David Schaich (he): with some large number of particles.

972
01:31:12.130 --> 01:31:15.960
David Schaich (he): We define the work that is done

973
01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:23.150
David Schaich (he): to the change in internal energy that we get

974
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:27.490
David Schaich (he): to be response to that internal energy.

975
01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.440
David Schaich (he): Do

976
01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:35.250
David Schaich (he): 2 Air force.

977
01:31:39.930 --> 01:31:40.960
David Schaich (he): So

978
01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:51.560
David Schaich (he): you've seen a few ways that the internal energy can't change. If we specifically consider applying the force to a statistical system, what that is going to do in general is

979
01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:56.690
David Schaich (he): change. One control parameter in particular

980
01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:08.420
David Schaich (he): force. We can expect to change the volume of the system. and just to illustrate

981
01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:13.100
David Schaich (he): what you have in mind.

982
01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:21.360
David Schaich (he): If we imagine an ideal gas in the container that

983
01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:27.360
David Schaich (he): is, at some number of particles with a fixed temperature team.

984
01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:31.210
David Schaich (he): we let one of the walls of this container the

985
01:32:31.410 --> 01:32:34.260
David Schaich (he): a moveable piston that we apply

986
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:37.860
David Schaich (he): that force F 2. It will shifts

987
01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:42.520
David Schaich (he): over by some amount to the X in that direction.

988
01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:48.600
David Schaich (he): It reduces the volume by the area

989
01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:53.210
David Schaich (he): of that wall which we can call a.

990
01:32:55.530 --> 01:33:00.770
David Schaich (he): So. The change in going in is that area a times change in X.

991
01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:05.890
David Schaich (he): It is negative, because the volume gets smaller. and we assume that this is

992
01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:09.600
David Schaich (he): so isentropically. The entropy is

993
01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:13.490
David Schaich (he): conserved. so that we can connect this to

994
01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:17.500
David Schaich (he): the our definition of the pressure.

995
01:33:17.850 --> 01:33:18.800
David Schaich (he): So.

996
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:30.950
David Schaich (he): pulling these things together, the work that is done by this force changing the volume of this canonical system. That is

997
01:33:33.370 --> 01:33:36.210
David Schaich (he): hmm. The change in

998
01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:43.340
David Schaich (he): the movement of this object. The change in the volume is parallel to the force.

999
01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.090
David Schaich (he): So that's

1000
01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:48.400
David Schaich (he): in your product. Just simplifies to

1001
01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:56.300
David Schaich (he): F. Times Delta. X. We've said that this is a change in the internal energy.

1002
01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:00.190
David Schaich (he): Yeah, it is

1003
01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:02.960
David Schaich (he): greater than 0.

1004
01:34:03.370 --> 01:34:10.430
David Schaich (he): So it greater than 0, because the force and the change in X are parallel. They are online.

1005
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:15.000
David Schaich (he): So what we have is

1006
01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:17.360
David Schaich (he): the internal energy

1007
01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:28.540
David Schaich (he): increasing by the Force Times displacement and the increase in energy It's due to

1008
01:34:29.770 --> 01:34:33.120
David Schaich (he): the volume decreasing in that same process.

1009
01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:37.980
David Schaich (he): So Delta V is

1010
01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:41.240
David Schaich (he): a Delta X with a minus sign.

1011
01:34:42.730 --> 01:34:45.870
David Schaich (he): What we can do is plug that into

1012
01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:59.970
David Schaich (he): our statistical definition of the pressure as a change in energy due to a change in the volume with fixed entropy. Yeah, the overall negative sign. The energy increases

1013
01:35:00.090 --> 01:35:01.950
David Schaich (he): by F. Delta X.

1014
01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:15.030
David Schaich (he): The volume decreases by it. minus in Delta X negative signs, and to access cancel off. And from our statistical physics definition

1015
01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:18.410
David Schaich (he): we I've seen it

1016
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:24.670
David Schaich (he): the result of the pressure. It is the force

1017
01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:28.210
David Schaich (he): per unit area

1018
01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:32.340
David Schaich (he): which is being exerted on

1019
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:38.150
David Schaich (he): the surface of the container. That yes.

1020
01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:47.080
David Schaich (he): so we can

1021
01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:49.220
David Schaich (he): see that

1022
01:35:50.850 --> 01:35:56.230
David Schaich (he): that there is a connection between the work F. Delta X. And the pressure.

1023
01:35:56.260 --> 01:36:08.230
David Schaich (he): I to the Executive here. and we will pick up tomorrow afternoon by rearranging this expression and interpreting pressure in terms of work as it first step forward

1024
01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:12.590
David Schaich (he): studying thermodynamic cycles. Wrap up here for

1025
01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:15.590
David Schaich (he): today just one last call to see if there are

1026
01:36:16.650 --> 01:36:28.140
David Schaich (he): any questions about the initial setup that we have connecting this pressure to it's mechanical idea of work being done by

1027
01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:32.740
David Schaich (he): changing the energy due to applying an external force.

1028
01:36:40.170 --> 01:36:47.930
David Schaich (he): So it looks like this is something you're all happy with. You Have a office hours now, and a chance tomorrow to

1029
01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:51.620
David Schaich (he): about this, if anything appears questionable.

1030
01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:53.580
David Schaich (he): But I will let you go

1031
01:36:53.730 --> 01:36:57.300
David Schaich (he): for now and see you tomorrow afternoon.
