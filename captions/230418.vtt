1
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.780
David Schaich (he): All right, we'll get going now, so that there will still be plenty of

2
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:15.650
David Schaich (he): sun left when we wrap up.  There are some in the room, some online, and some I'm sure enjoying the first warm, sunny day

3
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.430
David Schaich (he): that I can recall.

4
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.380
David Schaich (he): So, we have the afternoon of Tuesday, the 18th of April.

5
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.370
David Schaich (he): I'm just barely able to see what I am writing on the

6
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.200
David Schaich (he): screen, even with the

7
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.690
David Schaich (he): blinds closed.  But I can write down the six-digit code for today: 4, 3, 4, 9, 1, 1.

8
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.070
David Schaich (he): And the plan for today is just to pick up where we left off

9
00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.580
David Schaich (he): yesterday: Wrap up the photon gas and go through a similar sort of exercise for fermions, looking at different limits of behaviour of ideal quantum gases.

10
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.310
David Schaich (he): So, as a reminder, for

11
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.080
David Schaich (he): a photon gas based on

12
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.930
David Schaich (he): the grand-canonical ensemble allowing the particle number and energy

13
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.510
David Schaich (he): to vary with fixed temperature and chemical potential.

14
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.040
David Schaich (he): Trying that to in quantum

15
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.460
David Schaich (he): goes on science, statistics.

16
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.260
David Schaich (he): those phones in which 4 times are

17
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:55.730
David Schaich (he): we certainly, from the read it through the potential you can derive it. Companies of interest. First of all

18
00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.050
David Schaich (he): the average energy density for the protons per UN

19
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:13.030
David Schaich (he): that we wrote. Yes. I need to move over you so called spectral function. That is equally well. A function of angular frequency. Omega.

20
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:26.710
David Schaich (he): you wanna the what you flying for the where this particular spectral function that it's

21
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.890
David Schaich (he): like spectrum you derive. It's 2 forms.

22
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.480
David Schaich (he): It's functions that I the frequency.

23
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.560
David Schaich (he): What a wavelength! In both cases we have

24
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.450
David Schaich (he): some pre-factor with unit conversion factors that

25
00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:04.470
David Schaich (he): the speed of let's see. And then the ratio. In this case of frequency to the exponential actor. the energy divided by the temperature

26
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.940
with you.

27
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.430
David Schaich (he): minus one

28
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.400
David Schaich (he): in terms of wavelength.

29
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.660
We also recall that the

30
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.980
David Schaich (he): wavelength and the angular frequency are related by the speed of the wave, which is the speed of lights for light.

31
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.850
David Schaich (he): So swapping frequency for wavelength in these integrals

32
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.130
David Schaich (he): takes the power of frequency and denominator, and it turns into

33
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.120
David Schaich (he): the nominator, went through the accounting that there are

34
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.580
David Schaich (he): it over 5 h

35
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.890
David Schaich (he): in the usual

36
00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:02.670
David Schaich (he): one over exponential 2 Pi Beta, H. R. C. Over Lambda minus one term. Yeah, we saw that

37
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.980
David Schaich (he): compared to some

38
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:16.200
David Schaich (he): observational data. the sun, stars, and cosmic microwave. All of that data was

39
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.490
David Schaich (he): very well described by the simple functions

40
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.840
David Schaich (he): that are based on

41
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.130
David Schaich (he): derivations. Assuming that non interacting ideal gas, the photons.

42
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.360
David Schaich (he): So the

43
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.250
David Schaich (he): extent to which this ideal gas provides a good description.

44
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.210
David Schaich (he): that sort of observational video you for both

45
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.100
David Schaich (he): objects with temperatures a 1,000 killed, and you

46
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.630
David Schaich (he): just a couple of how about absolute 0

47
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.120
David Schaich (he): use illustrating

48
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:09.120
David Schaich (he): power of statistical physics, even with fairly extreme assumptions about the form of interactions. In this case their absence.

49
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.760
David Schaich (he): So call to see if there are questions about where we got up to

50
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.040
David Schaich (he): yesterday.

51
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.160
David Schaich (he): not seeing any. You can

52
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.560
David Schaich (he): charge ahead with this expression for the energy density in terms of

53
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:37.560
David Schaich (he): with my spectrum. and yes. finish. The conversation might actually carry out

54
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.550
David Schaich (he): this integral

55
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.680
David Schaich (he): for that future, giving me. So i'll put the volume back on

56
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.730
David Schaich (he): the right inside of this expression. It is 20 in that you like spectrum

57
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.310
David Schaich (he): in terms of frequency

58
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.880
David Schaich (he): that has. and

59
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.340
David Schaich (he): very phone.

60
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.940
David Schaich (he): If we change variables to

61
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.030
David Schaich (he): some X's beta h bar omega. So the photon energy divided by temperature

62
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.980
David Schaich (he): you is that

63
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.950
David Schaich (he): over H bar

64
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.660
David Schaich (he): the next. So plugging in

65
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.170
David Schaich (he): this change of variables for the

66
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:45.780
David Schaich (he): 3 powers of frequency. You have the deal, and you get 4 factors of this ratio of temperature

67
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.090
David Schaich (he): over planks. Constant

68
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.620
David Schaich (he): the ratio X to over the X minus one. Dx wish

69
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:07.340
David Schaich (he): is a a little bit too complicated for a smaller going through as a derivation here in now.

70
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.150
David Schaich (he): but it is a famous integral that I see this one off the screen.

71
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.560
David Schaich (he): There is that change of variables.

72
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.410
David Schaich (he): the famous integral, because it has a very delicious spell. It turns out to be

73
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.610
David Schaich (he): work through it your own time, the product of

74
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.890
David Schaich (he): the you have a function of 4 to this

75
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.340
David Schaich (he): 3 factorial or 6 Zeta function.

76
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.830
David Schaich (he): also of 4.

77
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:52.970
David Schaich (he): The remote data function for 4 is 4 powers of pie divided by 90.

78
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.450
So remind me.

79
00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.650
David Schaich (he): yeah.

80
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:04.710
David Schaich (he): end result for the average internal energy.

81
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:10.780
David Schaich (he): That is kind of the fourth over 2 powers of I square

82
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.330
David Schaich (he): 90 over 6 is 15,

83
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.410
and there are

84
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.760
David Schaich (he): 3 h of H bar and 3 h of C left over.

85
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.020
David Schaich (he): because I see, as a

86
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:32.500
David Schaich (he): next combination that has dimensions of energy, times length. Those are the units that

87
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.240
David Schaich (he): those factors.

88
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:46.530
David Schaich (he): and you know, similar to that connection between energy length. We want some lengths on the right hand side we have a volume, and then 4 h

89
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:54.980
David Schaich (he): of the temperature, and that is a small, compact expression for the average internal energy

90
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.680
David Schaich (he): in terms of so the the

91
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.810
David Schaich (he): the fourth power of the temperature.

92
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:04.950
David Schaich (he): you know

93
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:10.470
David Schaich (he): we call that for classical

94
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.280
David Schaich (he): gases

95
00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.040
David Schaich (he): that will be first

96
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.360
David Schaich (he): statistical physics.

97
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:35.190
David Schaich (he): One of the main results we derive is that the

98
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.400
David Schaich (he): it's just 3 half times the number of particles times the temperature.

99
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:50.590
David Schaich (he): if we want to. It's something of a similar form here for a quantum grand canonical relativistic. I feel gas at both phones.

100
00:09:53.390 --> 00:10:02.360
David Schaich (he): We need to do something about that number of particles which was fixed in the canonical case, but fluctuating it.

101
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.730
David Schaich (he): it's another

102
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.890
David Schaich (he): compute from the Grand Canonical partition function.

103
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:19.700
David Schaich (he): Now we started off with yesterday after the break. In particular.

104
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:25.850
David Schaich (he): the expression be right before the break, for the average political number and canonical ensemble

105
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.450
David Schaich (he): was. How are you?

106
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:39.880
David Schaich (he): The grand canonical potential with respect to the chemical potential, You and you I did yesterday that you 40 foot on Jas

107
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:46.030
David Schaich (he): is approximately 0. This photons are easy to create and destroy all the kind of bolding, much energy.

108
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.480
David Schaich (he): So after we take

109
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.680
David Schaich (he): that derivative. Of the

110
00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.330
David Schaich (he): good for you.

111
00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:00.340
David Schaich (he): functional expression for the particle number, we would be able to set the chemical potential to 0

112
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.530
David Schaich (he): to simplify that expression.

113
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.750
David Schaich (he): So let's go ahead and

114
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.450
David Schaich (he): do that.

115
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:16.150
David Schaich (he): The screen economical potential you looked at just yesterday.

116
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.060
David Schaich (he): We'll implicitly rewrite it by.

117
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.950
David Schaich (he): I can get into this expression

118
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.640
David Schaich (he): negative sign out for us

119
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.140
David Schaich (he): Google frequencies

120
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.740
David Schaich (he): from 0 to infinity of the frequency squared. And then.

121
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.350
yeah.

122
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.420
David Schaich (he): that depends on the chemical potential.

123
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.070
David Schaich (he): and

124
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.780
David Schaich (he): will be affected by the derivative

125
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.300
David Schaich (he): So this is not

126
00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:02.610
quite similar to the derivative that we computed to get the energy that state

127
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:12.150
David Schaich (he): in the first place, just taking the derivative with respect to the chemical potential mute instead of the inverse temperature data.

128
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:18.140
David Schaich (he): So what i'm just out of this

129
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.480
David Schaich (he): is the

130
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.540
David Schaich (he): not.

131
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:44.740
David Schaich (he): And then with the chain rule, let me have You'll get a square from before be happy. negative factor of those exponentials.

132
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:54.130
David Schaich (he): And then we bring down the derivative of the exponential factor. With respect to the issues

133
00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.200
David Schaich (he): itself. Steve

134
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.670
David Schaich (he): Beta is going to cancel out with the

135
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:09.360
David Schaich (he): University of the temperature. See negative signs also cancel. and let me know

136
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.840
David Schaich (he): the vanishing chemical, potential

137
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:24.990
David Schaich (he): and simple. I to this usual.

138
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:40.170
David Schaich (he): and then integral over so dividing E to the minus as he enters you integral

139
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.180
David Schaich (he): E to the Beta h bar Omega, minus one in the denominator, and Omega squared

140
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.110
David Schaich (he): the omega

141
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.450
David Schaich (he): in the numerator, which

142
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:58.570
David Schaich (he): actually, if we go back to the planning spectrum. you can see that the up to the factor of the that we.

143
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:07.840
David Schaich (he): this integral differs only by a factor of H. Bar Omega, which is the energy of the photons which

144
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:13.590
David Schaich (he): make some sense. We want the energy of the photon gas. What we need to do is

145
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.560
David Schaich (he): integrate not only over the number, but over the

146
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.350
David Schaich (he): number of hotels

147
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:24.880
David Schaich (he): as a function of frequency weighted by the energy that they carry. H. Bar Omega

148
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.430
David Schaich (he): something that

149
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.520
David Schaich (he): we will make use of when

150
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:39.900
David Schaich (he): you turn to the next. It provides a little trip. Yeah would have allowed us to jump straight from the like spectrum. 2 mis results without

151
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:47.790
David Schaich (he): of the derivative steps at reproduced. That answer we can justify physically

152
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:57.450
David Schaich (he): making the same change of variables as we did when evaluating that planning spectrum we're integrating over it.

153
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.340
David Schaich (he): It's an X equal to

154
00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.370
David Schaich (he): 2 factors when they go times that, do you, Omega?

155
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:17.540
David Schaich (he): We'll combine it to give us to you over H. Calling now to the third rather than forward power

156
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.460
David Schaich (he): integral now x squared

157
00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:26.450
David Schaich (he): i'm. Bringing to the X minus one Gx.

158
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.820
David Schaich (he): Another delicious, integral.

159
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.110
David Schaich (he): quite similar to the one before. And

160
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:41.410
David Schaich (he): there you so all the elegance results. That's again too much of it

161
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.030
David Schaich (he): paying to

162
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.470
David Schaich (he): computes live in this module.

163
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.350
David Schaich (he): This is

164
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.440
David Schaich (he): so 2 factorial 2,

165
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.080
you know, data function

166
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.610
David Schaich (he): the 3, which is an international number about 1 point.

167
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.620
David Schaich (he): 2 0 2

168
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.020
David Schaich (he): so pretty everything together.

169
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.520
David Schaich (he): Average

170
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:25.860
David Schaich (he): volume of that gas times. 3 h of the temperature with another

171
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.430
David Schaich (he): of the other 2.

172
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.290
David Schaich (he): Is it a 3

173
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:39.590
David Schaich (he): high school, really. and then another 3 vectors of Hrc.

174
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.270
David Schaich (he): So now

175
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:57.020
David Schaich (he): we just barely have the 2 results for energy and particle number fitting up the screen at once.

176
00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:01.120
David Schaich (he): and quite nicely. We can see that their functional form

177
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:07.339
David Schaich (he): is what we would have expected from our earlier classical, economical, and not an optimistic idea.

178
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.750
You ask computation.

179
00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:14.210
David Schaich (he): The energy is proportional to the

180
00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:26.910
David Schaich (he): the number particle. Is this proportion of boring types of your cube in a different, only bypass single power of temperature. Really. now it is somewhat more

181
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.610
David Schaich (he): complicated.

182
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:36.360
David Schaich (he): We have. so as

183
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.840
David Schaich (he): in that classical economical case.

184
00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:54.590
David Schaich (he): so the time the S internal energy is proportional to and times T. And the

185
00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:06.100
David Schaich (he): use going to give us a high school over 15.

186
00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.360
David Schaich (he): I squared

187
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.960
David Schaich (he): over 2 from the number density.

188
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:26.820
David Schaich (he): and if we

189
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.470
David Schaich (he): you cancel in terms. and remember where

190
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:48.120
David Schaich (he): numbers like 6 and 2 are coming from the You have a functions okay and factorial. you can. But this, suggested we as

191
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.270
David Schaich (he): 6.

192
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.730
David Schaich (he): Why, that to

193
00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.920
David Schaich (he): Zeta 3, so that 6, over 9 is one over 15.

194
00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:10.830
David Schaich (he): What factors of pie? And this is just the how many of you. You know the functions that we set it off, with

195
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.690
David Schaich (he): which we were to put all that in about 2.7

196
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:22.540
David Schaich (he): in decimal terms. So not quite twice as large as the rehabs

197
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:23.550
David Schaich (he): 4

198
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:29.610
David Schaich (he): a classical, non-relativistic ideal gas and the economic ensemble, still the same

199
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.150
David Schaich (he): order of magnitude. and they

200
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:44.180
David Schaich (he): some combination of really fundamental physical functions, that function.

201
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:53.040
David Schaich (he): So any questions about this result before we go ahead to

202
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.580
David Schaich (he): complete the derivation of the equation of States

203
00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.720
David Schaich (he): for the photon gas

204
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.790
David Schaich (he): again if we pick back to That's

205
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.280
David Schaich (he): classical ideal gas. We did

206
00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:24.310
David Schaich (he): several weeks ago. The equation of state. There is the ideal des off pressure times for you is

207
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:30.110
David Schaich (he): particle number times temperature. So we we'll want to try to

208
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.390
David Schaich (he): produce something similar in particular relating this

209
00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:39.870
David Schaich (he): actor of average particle number of times temperature 2 pressure, and told you

210
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:44.550
David Schaich (he): up to guess which. Of course, the missing piece we don't have yet is

211
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.610
David Schaich (he): the pressure of the proton. Yes. which

212
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.460
David Schaich (he): is call fancy terms the the radiation pressure

213
00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:03.960
David Schaich (he): small enough for that to It's something we don't know this day a day, but. like shining on a surface.

214
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:09.960
David Schaich (he): will actually produce the pressure on that service, exerting the force, pushing it away.

215
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:17.990
David Schaich (he): which. on our usual definition of pressure and statistical physics, is given by

216
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.990
David Schaich (he): the response. The internal energy.

217
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:36.590
David Schaich (he): 2 way changes the volume. the negative signs, and it's more volume secured. What your energies. subject to the screens that the entropy on the

218
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.980
David Schaich (he): so before evaluating it. This derivative

219
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.630
David Schaich (he): of the energy that we have just computed a few months ago.

220
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:52.690
David Schaich (he): I need to make sure that we. the

221
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.580
which is.

222
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.260
David Schaich (he): yeah, one more

223
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.760
David Schaich (he): derive quality that

224
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:02.170
David Schaich (he): Yeah, I would

225
00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:02.820
you.

226
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.270
David Schaich (he): It's very usual malaysia

227
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.890
David Schaich (he): that we derive when the

228
00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.870
David Schaich (he): the entropy is the difference between the internal energy.

229
00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.200
That's great potential

230
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.400
David Schaich (he): the temperature.

231
00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.390
David Schaich (he): Before we computed the internal energy.

232
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:36.410
David Schaich (he): it's easy enough to divide it that result by a factor of temperature missing piece. Here

233
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:39.440
David Schaich (he): is the great economical potential

234
00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.780
David Schaich (he): divided by the temperature which we have in terms

235
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:52.800
David Schaich (he): of the integral over frequencies. the usual omega square, the what is derivative we just took

236
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:57.860
David Schaich (he): or minus E to the Beta H. Bar Omega and Chemical potential.

237
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.160
David Schaich (he): 2 0

238
00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:12.690
David Schaich (he): and making the familiar change of variables. X equals data. H. Bar Omega. you pick up 3 factors of

239
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:15.390
David Schaich (he): you over H bar.

240
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.480
David Schaich (he): and then the Pi square. which for a few C here

241
00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.560
David Schaich (he): integral now for x.

242
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:44.980
David Schaich (he): that's fit on the screen, and it's the same story with this particular integral. It is closely related to

243
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:55.120
David Schaich (he): the ones we deal with before which just came from derivatives of this integrand. so it's not too surprising that it has a

244
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:57.980
David Schaich (he): similar.

245
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.640
David Schaich (he): You know it's very similar results that we yeah

246
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.730
David Schaich (he): look at all 4 States rather than

247
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.970
through

248
00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:11.920
David Schaich (he): now as a negative sign of maybe 2 times 0 over 4.

249
00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:14.320
David Schaich (he): I'm sure with the call. See that

250
00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.700
David Schaich (he): 5. What's over

251
00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.390
David Schaich (he): 25,

252
00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.490
David Schaich (he): So the

253
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.290
David Schaich (he): Yes.

254
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.730
a common factor of

255
00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:36.060
David Schaich (he): me to you.

256
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:44.470
David Schaich (he): Yeah. How's it? From the energy high squared over

257
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.850
David Schaich (he): 15,

258
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.340
David Schaich (he): you can actually note that the

259
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.770
David Schaich (he): I have there.

260
00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:10.020
David Schaich (he): I'll give another a factor of the Pi squared over H. Bar, Q, C. Q. So that's common factor to both terms.

261
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.920
David Schaich (he): and the difference. We just have a

262
00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:21.050
David Schaich (he): one over 15 from the energy, and then minus negative one over 45.

263
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.240
David Schaich (he): So

264
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.670
David Schaich (he): plus one over 45,

265
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:32.620
David Schaich (he): second term there. so that's 3 46, plus 150.

266
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.150
David Schaich (he): What like this?

267
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:46.800
David Schaich (he): Which is a fun factor from combinations of you know, Zeta functions, but

268
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:51.550
David Schaich (he): not what we need to worry about too much.

269
00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:56.020
David Schaich (he): What matters is the condition of the

270
00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.470
David Schaich (he): that

271
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.450
the functional form.

272
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:10.970
David Schaich (he): the combination of has to be fixed to a constant i'm. Taking the derivative to compute radiation pressure.

273
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.610
David Schaich (he): So this go ahead and do that

274
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:23.860
David Schaich (he): once you plug in the what time you guys energy.

275
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.130
David Schaich (he): which has negative sign

276
00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:32.370
David Schaich (he): we just described. I square over 15.

277
00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.030
David Schaich (he): Let me take the

278
00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.800
David Schaich (he): with our temperature.

279
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:46.400
That

280
00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:50.060
David Schaich (he): temperature equals some constant times

281
00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.420
David Schaich (he): into the minus one to the power

282
00:26:55.450 --> 00:27:01.450
David Schaich (he): which enforces the condition of the Council of entropy. That's 18 queued.

283
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.800
David Schaich (he): Is that cost to be.

284
00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:06.850
David Schaich (he): Then the volume Times

285
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:11.600
David Schaich (he): to the fourth gives us you to the 4 power

286
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:16.500
David Schaich (he): times. V. To the minus 4 third plus one.

287
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.810
David Schaich (he): It's back to one-third.

288
00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:23.680
David Schaich (he): which

289
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:30.590
David Schaich (he): brings out a negative sign in the factory of 3

290
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.750
David Schaich (he): no

291
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.200
David Schaich (he): along with a factor of the volume of the derivative

292
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:43.280
David Schaich (he): negative signs with that. Well. that

293
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.600
David Schaich (he): constant factor.

294
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.600
David Schaich (he): you know.

295
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:59.980
David Schaich (he): taking the one over V from derivative out there. So we are back to being to the negative one-third power

296
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:03.870
David Schaich (he): So much as we saw.

297
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:06.670
Yeah.

298
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:14.410
David Schaich (he): case of the classical equation of states. We just get yeah internal energy

299
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.770
David Schaich (he): back out. Again.

300
00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:21.480
David Schaich (he): How do you? Same combination of the

301
00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:22.830
sure he was.

302
00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.590
David Schaich (he): Yeah, in the first place. So.

303
00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.540
David Schaich (he): in other words.

304
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:34.440
David Schaich (he): radiation pressure on the full time they have small. I buy

305
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:37.770
David Schaich (he): It's one good

306
00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:40.960
average internal energy.

307
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:48.130
David Schaich (he): which. if we right one for as 2 over 6,

308
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.190
David Schaich (he): identify it.

309
00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:04.230
David Schaich (he): Another factor of you know, functions to go on with the ratio again, and 0 functions.

310
00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.060
David Schaich (he): Yes.

311
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:15.350
David Schaich (he): we found before 2 number

312
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.810
David Schaich (he): all right. average number of

313
00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.420
David Schaich (he): so those terms all cancel out.

314
00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.840
David Schaich (he): Can we end up just with that ratio of Zeta functions. Now

315
00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.770
David Schaich (he): the 4, this pilot

316
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.440
David Schaich (he): over 90 times the irrational

317
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.590
David Schaich (he): 0 3

318
00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.990
David Schaich (he): times the photon number and temperature. So

319
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.610
David Schaich (he): we have the in the end.

320
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:02.150
David Schaich (he): That's the same

321
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:14.040
David Schaich (he): functional form. Is the it's proportional to M. To you that possible proportionality. It is just change now

322
00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:17.360
David Schaich (he): from one that in the classical case.

323
00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:25.370
David Schaich (he): to this ratio of the functions you might recall that the Zeta function approaches one.

324
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.230
David Schaich (he): Yes, it's argument increases

325
00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.040
David Schaich (he): positive real access.

326
00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:35.740
David Schaich (he): Say the 4. Is there 1 point, one

327
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:40.940
David Schaich (he): data, 3, as I said before, is that 1.2 or 2, so their ratio is

328
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:48.740
David Schaich (he): approximately 4.9 to a few significant figure. It's rather than one. So

329
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.680
David Schaich (he): difference compared to the

330
00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.530
David Schaich (he): I have to go. I It's just absolutely.

331
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.310
David Schaich (he): We're 10% variation.

332
00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:04.400
David Schaich (he): You know

333
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.810
David Schaich (he): the cost of proportionality between pressure times

334
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:11.270
one side compared to

335
00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:16.400
David Schaich (he): average.

336
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:31.530
David Schaich (he): So that is in principle something that we created go through the same source of exercises with thermodynamic cycles and see how does it behave with the I guess the photons.

337
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:44.850
David Schaich (he): yes. even more of thought experience something we would do in practice. So I think we can be content just to declared victory here that the

338
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.820
David Schaich (he): conclusion that the ultimate relativistic

339
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:50.920
David Schaich (he): autumn gas or photons is

340
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:55.130
David Schaich (he): behavior the same as

341
00:31:55.250 --> 00:32:11.080
David Schaich (he): the classical. and we can turn our attention now to something that will have a few more significant differences. You get photons.

342
00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.520
David Schaich (he): so i'll just check to see if there are

343
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:23.190
David Schaich (he): questions or objections to a result cell phone or switching gears and going back to the starting point.

344
00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:46.810
David Schaich (he): not seeing any. We'll charge your head. We are definitely not going to finish talking about

345
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.280
David Schaich (he): knowledge reactive

346
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.080
David Schaich (he): today.

347
00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:59.060
David Schaich (he): We can at least you can start in and take care of the

348
00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:06.960
David Schaich (he): 11 areas as a reminder. Well fermions the occupation numbers for the energy levels that we sell over

349
00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.120
the quantum statistical approach are limited

350
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.380
David Schaich (he): to

351
00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:16.610
David Schaich (he): the energy level being either unoccupied in occupation over a 0.

352
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:24.430
David Schaich (he): We're simply occupied an occupation of one. Everything else is for all the exclusion principle.

353
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:26.050
It was.

354
00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:34.770
David Schaich (he): We economic potential for

355
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.660
David Schaich (he): the negative temperature.

356
00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:50.630
David Schaich (he): I'm. The of the she's right. You saw yesterday. It was a product over energy levels that logarithm towards the product

357
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.410
David Schaich (he): to a

358
00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:01.290
David Schaich (he): one plus the exponential factor

359
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:03.960
David Schaich (he): inverse temperature.

360
00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:05.540
the energy

361
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.060
David Schaich (he): at the

362
00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:10.370
David Schaich (he): and that chemical attention which is no longer

363
00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.550
David Schaich (he): what to be

364
00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.840
David Schaich (he): vanishing in general.

365
00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:22.250
David Schaich (he): Yeah. you can know that the main difference we have here compared to the

366
00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:25.920
David Schaich (he): yes, my economical potential.

367
00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:30.980
David Schaich (he): I just negative signs with the overall negative sign up front

368
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.130
David Schaich (he): and the relative negative sign in that logarithm we have

369
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:37.760
David Schaich (he): some fairly extreme effects

370
00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.590
David Schaich (he): to.

371
00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:49.560
David Schaich (he): Would you see overlap with the photon gas? We just consider, unless return to non-volatistic

372
00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.199
David Schaich (he): energies. So

373
00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:59.040
David Schaich (he): is P. Squared over 2 M. The P. Squared is quantized

374
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.590
David Schaich (he): a call queue

375
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:05.670
David Schaich (he): that brings in like usual

376
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:16.350
David Schaich (he): factors of each bar square. That minus pi squared over 2 ml squared 50, you know. Call that

377
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.560
David Schaich (he): of the integer.

378
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:31.040
David Schaich (he): Well, then, some vector so. and just right. What was that?

379
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.210
David Schaich (he): It is

380
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:38.230
David Schaich (he): a squared in the inner product of that 3, vector where all of these.

381
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.830
David Schaich (he): all the components.

382
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:47.110
David Schaich (he): what this discreet he did, your momentum are strictly positive integers.

383
00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.650
David Schaich (he): So this

384
00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:58.310
David Schaich (he): into the economical potential.

385
00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:03.250
David Schaich (he): A fresh page

386
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.770
David Schaich (he): is

387
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:13.830
David Schaich (he): 3 vectors. K:

388
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:16.140
David Schaich (he): I see. Yeah.

389
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.640
David Schaich (he): one plus

390
00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.800
David Schaich (he): the exponential.

391
00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:23.920
And this

392
00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.640
David Schaich (he): nice council squared, Pi squared

393
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:40.640
David Schaich (he): 2 Ml. Squared times the temperature. whatever temperature is data. And then there is Yes. we issue a chemical potential to I for sure.

394
00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:44.400
David Schaich (he): all inside

395
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:48.040
David Schaich (he): and it

396
00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:55.990
David Schaich (he): I've looked over the gap here because the real that fermions like electrons in

397
00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:58.800
David Schaich (he): video

398
00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.760
David Schaich (he): have an additional factor of 2 double the you ever see.

399
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:12.910
David Schaich (he): For all of the energy laws. We also had a factor of 2 to the photon gas where it was coming from the 2 polarizations

400
00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:20.950
David Schaich (he): something that you can look at, and it's just horrible. On Thursday, if there is demand.

401
00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:30.630
David Schaich (he): in fact, to here is coming from a different source. It's difficult for me on this in everyday materials

402
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:31.470
that phones.

403
00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:33.010
David Schaich (he): Okay.

404
00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:35.900
David Schaich (he): hey?

405
00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:41.010
David Schaich (he): Yes. Here.

406
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.730
David Schaich (he): right

407
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.270
David Schaich (he): with the location marks, because these are not actually spinning

408
00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:48.960
David Schaich (he): just has a

409
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.100
David Schaich (he): In some ways they behave as though they were.

410
00:37:54.340 --> 00:38:03.270
David Schaich (he): It's a, and it's sort of the serious as usual for this module you don't need to have seen before.

411
00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:08.760
David Schaich (he): Give me a calls it back to the 2. Yeah, we will carry through

412
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:25.550
David Schaich (he): the following calculations. But no, every momentum 3 vector is going to have that additional two-fold degeneracy in addition to degeneracy is coming from, say.

413
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:31.020
David Schaich (he): from we're hitting around pretty much of the space so exactly the same in this respect

414
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:37.380
David Schaich (he): as the great economic potential. What are you? Yes.

415
00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:41.070
David Schaich (he): Another similar area that we can do.

416
00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.620
David Schaich (he): One of the simplifications

417
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.210
David Schaich (he): that we have 5 in the

418
00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:59.350
David Schaich (he): Okay. Assume that the what we're dealing with is large compared to

419
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:06.830
David Schaich (he): the characteristic scale. For the particles in question. So this some 3 vectors

420
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:11.600
David Schaich (he): and just become an integral over

421
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:13.930
David Schaich (he): continuous.

422
00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:20.820
David Schaich (he): maybe holes

423
00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.560
David Schaich (he): up here there. K. Squared.

424
00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:29.940
David Schaich (he): Stay out of it

425
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:44.540
David Schaich (he): after, because the argument of the world has only all that scalar inner product. K. Squared. we will benefit again from working in.

426
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:53.590
David Schaich (he): So with this

427
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:57.010
David Schaich (he): simplification.

428
00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:04.080
David Schaich (he): the positive moment to restrict the integral to just one octave of

429
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.940
David Schaich (he): three-dimensional space. That you'll be

430
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.840
David Schaich (he): is 4 pi the total solid angle

431
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.280
David Schaich (he): by 8, which is pi over 2 and 2

432
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:22.710
David Schaich (he): answers that 2 upfronts. So we get

433
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.530
David Schaich (he): minus pi team

434
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:34.650
David Schaich (he): look similar to the the potential for the proton gas.

435
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:40.230
David Schaich (he): A hat squared times that log really

436
00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.560
David Schaich (he): of the same exponential factor. Right?

437
00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:51.980
David Schaich (he): You had it all

438
00:40:55.910 --> 00:41:02.390
David Schaich (he): integrating now over the K hat. the magnitude 3. Vector

439
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:08.000
David Schaich (he): So this is where similarities with the photon gas

440
00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:13.970
David Schaich (he): start to cease just because we have how much different dependence

441
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:16.500
David Schaich (he): all that that will mention. Kate

442
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:21.520
David Schaich (he): got it in this integrand. He said that even the minus Beta h bar omega.

443
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:28.820
David Schaich (he): we have e to the minus beta times. It's not optimistic over the

444
00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:36.150
David Schaich (he): and the easiest way to deal with that is actually to

445
00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.700
David Schaich (he): recognize that it is the energy.

446
00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.830
and she period was

447
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:49.880
David Schaich (he): to work in terms of the energy itself rather than these.

448
00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.750
David Schaich (he): So the energy

449
00:41:54.440 --> 00:42:03.820
David Schaich (he): is this factor here, apart from the K hat squared over 2 Ml. Squared. We you.

450
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:09.350
David Schaich (he): We arrange that to get the

451
00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.270
David Schaich (he): we will have.

452
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.920
David Schaich (he): How over?

453
00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:25.960
David Schaich (he): Hi, h bar.

454
00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:33.300
David Schaich (he): I'm taking the square root of all those factors.

455
00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:38.180
David Schaich (he): and i'll give you a square root of 2, and with the energy itself

456
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:48.060
David Schaich (he): the differential factor. It corresponds to this variable.

457
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:49.460
David Schaich (he): then

458
00:42:53.800 --> 00:43:00.130
David Schaich (he): the derivative of the square root of the energy. It's in a one-half the partial

459
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:05.480
David Schaich (he): how the energy goes down.

460
00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.080
the one I have.

461
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:08.440
David Schaich (he): and then

462
00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:15.610
David Schaich (he): on top. So. putting all of this in.

463
00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:19.160
David Schaich (he): we have

464
00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:24.870
David Schaich (he): minus high times. T we have

465
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:27.000
David Schaich (he): 3 h of.

466
00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:33.100
David Schaich (he): for the K squared Dk

467
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:49.340
David Schaich (he): Limits of integration are still the same as K. Goes to infinity. The energy

468
00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.660
David Schaich (he): Okay, square. You didn't have that

469
00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:58.890
David Schaich (he): £2 of the square root left. So actually, 2

470
00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:04.180
David Schaich (he): times the logarithm of one plus.

471
00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:14.670
David Schaich (he): So that simplification is the reason we changed these variables in the first place.

472
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:19.090
David Schaich (he): and then from the Dk apps we have

473
00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.580
over

474
00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:24.950
David Schaich (he): that square root of 2 E.

475
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:43.230
David Schaich (he): So the 3 powers of L. You can recognize as the usual volume. We still have the power of team that pie cancels out with one of the 3

476
00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:50.870
David Schaich (he): factories that we have the denominator. So it's pi squared each part you. and then

477
00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.650
David Schaich (he): we have a factor of 2 over 2,

478
00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.180
David Schaich (he): 3 h of

479
00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:03.490
David Schaich (he): is the square root of that mass cube.

480
00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:08.360
David Schaich (he): and then integral itself.

481
00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:15.530
David Schaich (he): the usual.

482
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.550
David Schaich (he): the yeah.

483
00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:27.620
David Schaich (he): And again.

484
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:32.830
David Schaich (he): compared to the grand canonical potential for the photon gas.

485
00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:40.580
David Schaich (he): The main difference here is in terms of the signs, the overall negative sign out from. And do you

486
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:45.240
David Schaich (he): the constant one

487
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:48.370
David Schaich (he): exponential factor

488
00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:55.210
David Schaich (he): there is. So this is a

489
00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:58.380
David Schaich (he): so. What

490
00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.680
David Schaich (he): offered integral to deal with

491
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:02.020
David Schaich (he): it

492
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:08.050
David Schaich (he): is sometimes just known as a fairly direct integrals as it arises in.

493
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:16.340
David Schaich (he): and there's a whole machinery. This is our call expansion that

494
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.860
David Schaich (he): exists to simplify and evaluate this

495
00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:31.140
David Schaich (he): on without relying on any modern technology. What we will do, not in the remaining 2 min. but on Monday

496
00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:34.020
David Schaich (he): what has to be

497
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:39.730
David Schaich (he): next? Simplification What comes from

498
00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:44.560
David Schaich (he): considering the behavior? I'll disintegrate

499
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:47.830
David Schaich (he): half the temperatures

500
00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:58.720
David Schaich (he): very far from the classical limits of high temperatures, where. with the

501
00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:08.770
David Schaich (he): both on for me, on and classical statistics, all converge to the same behavior. So, in addition to simplifying the calculation.

502
00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:13.420
David Schaich (he): this low temperature regime is an interesting one to sort of maximize the importance

503
00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:18.100
David Schaich (he): of quantum effects. Yeah. this for me, I guess.

504
00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:20.320
People see him

505
00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:21.590
David Schaich (he): on Monday.

506
00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:25.370
David Schaich (he): How that leads to a simplification

507
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:32.970
David Schaich (he): of our results so far? What do you, grand canonical potential for that for me on gas?

508
00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:41.470
David Schaich (he): It's not going to be the obvious thing to see. So we won't Get into it today. I will wrap up there just with a

509
00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:45.520
David Schaich (he): I'll call 4 am questions or concerns about

510
00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.980
David Schaich (he): what we've done so far this week with these ideal calls and gases.

511
00:47:55.790 --> 00:48:02.570
David Schaich (he): Not seeing any. I'll let you go. Enjoy the sunshine and see you again. Thursday morning.

512
00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.880
David Schaich (he): I'll go into

513
00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:08.540
David Schaich (he): fancy models of sell this kind of reproduce

514
00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:13.320
David Schaich (he): some additional experimental data now coming from smaller scale.

515
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:19.940
David Schaich (he): some stories, and in your cellar space.
