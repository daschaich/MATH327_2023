1
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.740
David Schaich (he): Let's start

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.010
David Schaich (he): getting the tutorial for this week underway.

3
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.610
David Schaich (he): On Thursday morning,

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:24.150
David Schaich (he): sixteenth of March, the magic number for today is

5
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.070
David Schaich (he): 5, 0,

6
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.490
David Schaich (he): 3, 9, 3, 4.

7
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.090
David Schaich (he): And the plan for today is to set aside the

8
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.300
David Schaich (he): new material we saw on Tuesday about the grand-canonical ensemble and

9
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.660
David Schaich (he): step back for a

10
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.780
David Schaich (he): quick wrap-up of the two topics we've been looking at --- the two applications we focused on

11
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.930
David Schaich (he): in the context of the canonical ensemble --- the

12
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.400
David Schaich (he): mixing of ideal gases in this

13
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:15.960
David Schaich (he): activity that was introduced last week, as well as a new activity on thermodynamical cycles going beyond the Carnot cycle from 200 years ago

14
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.000
David Schaich (he): and

15
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.850
David Schaich (he): looking at some cycles with a bit more

16
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:30.270
David Schaich (he): relevance to our everyday life in the twenty-first century. In particular cycles that avoid slow

17
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:41.190
David Schaich (he): isothermal stages that take too long to carry out in practical engines. But before this is opportunity to

18
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.460
David Schaich (he): ask any questions about

19
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:55.680
David Schaich (he): any topic of the module things we've looked at and aren't clear What things, were you? Yeah, I looked at that seem related to.

20
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.510
David Schaich (he): and maybe not

21
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.420
David Schaich (he): ask the question of my over while you consider if you have any of yours. which is

22
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.310
David Schaich (he): how much details you you want to see about

23
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:23.670
David Schaich (he): rapidly through this mixing entropy calculation that was introduced last week in particular. Do any of you want to shout out the

24
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.390
David Schaich (he): results they've got for the mixing entropy in this slightly simplified case, where

25
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.750
David Schaich (he): all the particles are indistinguishable except for

26
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:42.860
David Schaich (he): one, that property, red versus new color that allows 2 sets of particles to be distinguished, one set from the other

27
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:24.790
David Schaich (he): bones here a result for the mixing entropy in this particular case from the where we looked at so indistinguishable fully

28
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.370
David Schaich (he): in the lecture. You know I have an intermediate case, and maybe

29
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.620
David Schaich (he): it might be worthwhile, for

30
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:47.550
David Schaich (he): we need to show it alternative way of carrying out the computation of that mixing entropy that differs from what we went through

31
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.060
David Schaich (he): in class.

32
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:58.380
David Schaich (he): So in particular from the class we would. The procedure will be introduced in classes to start, as always, with the

33
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.470
David Schaich (he): partition function that contains the full information about all of the microstates.

34
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.660
David Schaich (he): all of it

35
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.710
David Schaich (he): our system

36
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.230
David Schaich (he): right, that here, so

37
00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:25.100
David Schaich (he): we have it just 2 factors of whatever n factorial and 2 and actors. all of it

38
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.530
David Schaich (he): to

39
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:39.790
David Schaich (he): particles in that in Volume 2 V. With the usual thermodynamic wavelength. That accounts for the part of those mass and temperature.

40
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.310
David Schaich (he): and

41
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.720
David Schaich (he): we have relations between the entropy and the hell, all free energy coming from the logarithm of this partition function.

42
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.260
David Schaich (he): there is a trick that yes, it is

43
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.260
David Schaich (he): suggested in the activity.

44
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.000
David Schaich (he): And it

45
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:09.230
David Schaich (he): it any of you take this route as it goes to but one that we're 3, 4, one, that we went through in the lecture.

46
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.750
David Schaich (he): shaking heads so

47
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.180
useful to

48
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:26.280
David Schaich (he): consider what we have in terms of so mixing entropy is the difference between interview that combined system minus the entropy, that we started off with the initial system

49
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:39.240
David Schaich (he): before the random group particles are about to mix. And, as I was saying. each of those entropies is the derivative with respect to temperature of the

50
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:49.130
David Schaich (he): free energy. And that's right. The negative, helpful, free energy, which is the positive temperature times, the log of the corresponding partition function.

51
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:56.770
David Schaich (he): So the difference between logs and partition functions in a derivative

52
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.140
David Schaich (he): and property of

53
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:08.770
David Schaich (he): it's a. Of the ratio of partition functions

54
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.950
David Schaich (he): which is useful because in that ratio. There can be many cancellations.

55
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.450
David Schaich (he): So in particular email mixing. And for video

56
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.830
David Schaich (he): here, the one, the expression we have, we can find proficient function just from the activity

57
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.480
David Schaich (he): we can actually carry out. This derivative.

58
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.580
Temperature is once we just get the

59
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.300
David Schaich (he): what was the partition function ratio?

60
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.660
David Schaich (he): We have temperature times

61
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.020
David Schaich (he): of that ratio.

62
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.900
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Given the

63
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.410
David Schaich (he): partition function for 2 separate gases of

64
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.580
David Schaich (he): particles that are indistinguishable on either side of that wall in the initial state. you know that

65
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.610
David Schaich (he): I can write this ratio. is It's repeating it.

66
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.180
David Schaich (he): We add to the left while we're in that

67
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:24.740
David Schaich (he): to be over lamb, the queue, and get to the 2 end. We have 2

68
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.620
David Schaich (he): guesses in the

69
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:41.400
David Schaich (he): each with and particles. So that's the partition function that we get for each one. They multiply because they are independent.

70
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.970
David Schaich (he): and everything

71
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.150
David Schaich (he): cancels off. Once you distribute that square, except for the

72
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:57.790
David Schaich (he): factor of to in the numerator. 2 to 2,

73
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.880
David Schaich (he): which is

74
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.770
David Schaich (he): second term, drops out immediately.

75
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:11.710
David Schaich (he): and the mixing entropy we immediately have It's the logarithm of this ratio to n more 2.

76
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.540
David Schaich (he): Of course, this is also what we can hit by computing that video.

77
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:25.290
David Schaich (he): almost free energy, and this derivative starting from that combined efficient function.

78
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.690
David Schaich (he): It's just

79
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.950
David Schaich (he): the cover way of organizing things that carries out cancellations prior to

80
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:44.430
David Schaich (he): taking derivatives rather than by going through the full process and observing the cancellations monthly and products. One other thing we can note is that

81
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.970
David Schaich (he): this 2 and log 2 with the 2 N.

82
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.510
David Schaich (he): 4 particles that we have

83
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:59.640
David Schaich (he): is actually the same mixing entropy as we had

84
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.980
David Schaich (he): in the case of fully distinguishable particles.

85
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:20.880
David Schaich (he): So this mixing entropy is the same mixing entropy that we. when we had more than just a color to tell particles that we can actually label every individual particle and keep track of them.

86
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.270
David Schaich (he): So in this case there is less information

87
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:37.380
David Schaich (he): about each particle that we can know in principle. But when we mix particles, even if we have 2 sets of otherwise

88
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:45.560
David Schaich (he): indistinguishable particles that different only by this single property. The increase in the entropy that we get from that mix in

89
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.670
David Schaich (he): is the same

90
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.830
David Schaich (he): as if we could label it all.

91
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.980
David Schaich (he): So this is something that is.

92
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.340
David Schaich (he): i'm not obvious, is not something I can really make a.

93
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:05.160
David Schaich (he): and she would have the conceptual physical argument, for it's something that is coming out of the mathematics and telling this

94
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:16.650
David Schaich (he): something very deep and not obvious about properties all the way physical systems. and how their information content

95
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:20.910
David Schaich (he): plays a role

96
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.950
David Schaich (he): as they all in time.

97
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.970
David Schaich (he): So that was the first task from the activity introduced

98
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:38.840
David Schaich (he): last week to be carried out over the the past week. and the second activity was actually the

99
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.500
David Schaich (he): the fun part that was looking at

100
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:47.140
David Schaich (he): this final state where the wall is reinserted in this

101
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.930
David Schaich (he): system. To separate

102
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:56.460
David Schaich (he): the guess is back into 2 separate subsystems.

103
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.760
David Schaich (he): We are now, thanks to

104
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:07.820
David Schaich (he): the mixing stage, we have residues on either side, and we want to check to make sure that the second wall of through dynamics

105
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:12.960
David Schaich (he): is obeyed, and the entropy continues to increase as we re insert

106
00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.020
David Schaich (he): this wall

107
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.450
David Schaich (he): something that we. our view, is the case

108
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.270
David Schaich (he): in the lecture for fully disable particles.

109
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:27.270
David Schaich (he): What's left? This left for this tutorial activity

110
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.890
in order to actually

111
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.950
David Schaich (he): carry out the calculation

112
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.840
David Schaich (he): that things do work out

113
00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.880
David Schaich (he): So it's. I'm assuming that if you

114
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.260
David Schaich (he): we're eager to volunteer the mixing entropy and that

115
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:53.890
David Schaich (he): sort of fits on these 2 lines. It's also worth going through the computation of the final entropy to make sure that

116
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:58.630
David Schaich (he): you get the feedback on how that should turn out, and some of the people

117
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.550
David Schaich (he): features being counter along the way.

118
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.320
Now, seeing

119
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:12.100
David Schaich (he): I mean you disagree with that plan. All try to keep an eye on the clock talk too long, and have enough time to

120
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.430
David Schaich (he): give you a new activity for the coming week.

121
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.660
David Schaich (he): Not a real

122
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.490
David Schaich (he): those that

123
00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:31.270
David Schaich (he): this trick we have developed of relating the differences of interviews to

124
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.600
David Schaich (he): the ratio of partition functions also helps to simplify

125
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.490
David Schaich (he): the computation of that final entropy which we can

126
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.130
David Schaich (he): perfectly rewrite as

127
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:52.640
David Schaich (he): the final entropy, minus the combined entropy, plus the combined entropy just scanning is attracting the same quantity

128
00:12:53.310 --> 00:13:06.570
David Schaich (he): which from our work above is the up, the whole of the ratio motion divided by in my

129
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.180
David Schaich (he): plus

130
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.470
David Schaich (he): the entropy we have in the combined system.

131
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.570
David Schaich (he): So we need to break down. I would have to be that

132
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.100
David Schaich (he): partition function for this final system, where

133
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.020
David Schaich (he): and we'll be

134
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:35.430
David Schaich (he): as we looked at in the previous tutorial with balance of the entropy is to assume up to sort of longer than the corrections

135
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.390
David Schaich (he): that are negligible. When we have a large number of particles.

136
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.440
David Schaich (he): it's safe to assume that the number of particles

137
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:48.740
David Schaich (he): end up on inside of that we inserted wall just by

138
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.280
David Schaich (he): the fact that the number of microstates with that even division

139
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:57.370
David Schaich (he): his followers to the any other possibilities.

140
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:07.310
David Schaich (he): So there are 2 and total particles, and we we assume, and are on each side of the wall.

141
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:13.020
David Schaich (he): So it on the left side

142
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.300
David Schaich (he): we have new

143
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:27.110
David Schaich (he): red particles. then we must necessarily have. and minus new blue particles on the left.

144
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:36.590
David Schaich (he): the remaining and minus new red and new blue also have to be on the right.

145
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.020
David Schaich (he): and the final partition function sums over

146
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:49.770
David Schaich (he): all the possible values of new. We can have none of the particles on the left being read, all of them on the right.

147
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.960
Our entropy balance is expected to be unlikely.

148
00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:05.280
David Schaich (he): or we can have all in red particles, new equals, and on the left it is equally unlikely compared to hey you

149
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.250
David Schaich (he): or mixed distribution.

150
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.620
David Schaich (he): The partition function is a new that

151
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:22.520
David Schaich (he): corresponds to this particular. we get the particles you can right, and as

152
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.110
David Schaich (he): a one over 2 factorial V over

153
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:39.800
David Schaich (he): to you. That's the new red particles on the left we have the and minus new blue particles. the same

154
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:48.430
David Schaich (he): different number of particles. and then on the right we have the same numbers of new. And so this

155
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.630
David Schaich (he): full product. Just get squared of one factor for the left system and one for the right.

156
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.260
David Schaich (he): So we can

157
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.760
David Schaich (he): do a bit of cancellation.

158
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.760
David Schaich (he): So that's new independent after

159
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.660
David Schaich (he): a volume over Lambda, cubed to the 2 N.

160
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:17.680
David Schaich (he): And then the for new and goals. one over

161
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.250
David Schaich (he): 2 factors of your

162
00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.490
David Schaich (he): factorial.

163
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.470
David Schaich (he): which we can

164
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:41.460
David Schaich (he): recognize as the binomial, coefficient, and she's new squared. divided through by the overall factorial

165
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:45.660
David Schaich (he): So partition function itself.

166
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.560
David Schaich (he): Then the

167
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:57.240
David Schaich (he): overall factor of one over

168
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:07.119
David Schaich (he): and occupy the volume. and some overdue just includes that's squared and binomial coefficients. which

169
00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:18.579
David Schaich (he): is a this. Some of the binomial coefficients squared, is known as a binomial cell in the hypertometric functions, all sorts of from self.

170
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.270
David Schaich (he): It's also a special case of this

171
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:35.080
David Schaich (he): vendor Volume got credit for by publishing it at some point in the 17 hundreds. It was some time later we go on to that Chinese mathematician, if you and

172
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.560
David Schaich (he): discovered it

173
00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:40.830
David Schaich (he): something like tough 400 to 500 years before

174
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:53.850
David Schaich (he): as that knowledge trickled through eventually to Europe. Hey! Move It's some historical recognition. But this sum over the square 5 of the coefficients is just

175
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.940
David Schaich (he): a single one on your coefficients

176
00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:00.410
David Schaich (he): 2 in she was in. So we have

177
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.530
David Schaich (he): this compact expression

178
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.470
David Schaich (he): for the final partition function.

179
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.250
David Schaich (he): Once the wall has been reinserted and

180
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.330
David Schaich (he): the particles are we divided within on

181
00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:21.110
David Schaich (he): good size?

182
00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:34.660
David Schaich (he): So all we have to do to get the entropy is now divided. This partition function by

183
00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:38.460
David Schaich (he): yeah combined one that we looked at earlier.

184
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:46.400
David Schaich (he): She is written up for the top of the page.

185
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.420
David Schaich (he): so the one over n

186
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:59.540
David Schaich (he): factorial square terms cancel out.

187
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:05.700
David Schaich (he): The Lamb is cancel out. Volume cancels out. All that does not cancel out is

188
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.470
factor of 2.

189
00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:11.850
David Schaich (he): We have the to.

190
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:17.760
David Schaich (he): and then the

191
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.460
David Schaich (he): prohibitions that we have

192
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:36.650
David Schaich (he): now in the final state from something over all of the possible distributions of regular particles. So that is the same. and the denominator from the combined system.

193
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:44.000
David Schaich (he): binomial, coefficient, also independent of temperature. So the second term in the

194
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.320
David Schaich (he): entropy difference will cancel out

195
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:54.080
David Schaich (he): is the combined entropy, plus

196
00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.990
David Schaich (he): the lord of that binomial coefficients.

197
00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.780
David Schaich (he): 2 and and then

198
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:10.620
David Schaich (he): 2 end factors of the log of 2 with the negative sign, because that is now in the denominator.

199
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.410
David Schaich (he): So it is

200
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.750
David Schaich (he): also suggested in the activity we

201
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:24.890
David Schaich (he): make a real, safe assumption that it is very large. We

202
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:36.450
David Schaich (he): hit this results with certainly this formula, one neglected. We're going in terms. So what we have to do is

203
00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.360
David Schaich (he): break up the

204
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:44.390
David Schaich (he): I know the coefficient into It's called I factorials.

205
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.980
We have the log of 2 and

206
00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:54.410
David Schaich (he): factorial by n factorial and 2 and minus the number and factorial.

207
00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:06.970
David Schaich (he): So the numerator log of 2 n factorial But Sterling is going to be 2 in 1, 2 and a minus 2 in and then

208
00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.500
negative sign

209
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:13.950
David Schaich (he): problem. Having these other factors in the denominator, we have 2 of them.

210
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:18.450
David Schaich (he): and they are just a single end factorial. So in

211
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.820
David Schaich (he): my name is, and

212
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:34.640
David Schaich (he): you can see that the constant terms. minus 2 n minus 2 times minus n cancel all the and log in

213
00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.780
David Schaich (he): terms cancel. All. All that is left is

214
00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:42.930
David Schaich (he): hey?

215
00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.650
David Schaich (he): 2 and 1, 2,

216
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:51.490
David Schaich (he): which looks familiar because it cancels off.

217
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:56.050
David Schaich (he): Video. we're meeting term coming from now.

218
00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:03.460
David Schaich (he): our trick of adding is attracting that combined system interview. So

219
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:17.450
David Schaich (he): all of those cancel. The end result is that at this level of approximation from St. This formula. the final entropy you

220
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:22.510
David Schaich (he): is equal to the combined entropy, which is greater greater than the starting entropy.

221
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.360
David Schaich (he): And the second law

222
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:26.730
David Schaich (he): is very happy

223
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.230
David Schaich (he): with that.

224
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.490
David Schaich (he): So that is

225
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.620
David Schaich (he): where we can declare victory, at least

226
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:43.000
David Schaich (he): in the large, and in so called from a dynamic limit, where sterling this

227
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.310
David Schaich (he): formula

228
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.540
David Schaich (he): becomes a better and better approximation at this level.

229
00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.680
David Schaich (he): If we

230
00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.610
David Schaich (he): end up, including the logarithmic terms in this expansion, it's

231
00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:04.450
David Schaich (he): through the one line calculation that okay verify

232
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.440
David Schaich (he): it gives us a final entropy

233
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.690
David Schaich (he): that is equal to the combined entropy

234
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:18.110
David Schaich (he): minus the wall rhythm of pie. i'm in

235
00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.810
David Schaich (he): over to you. Actually

236
00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.020
David Schaich (he): okay. square root.

237
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:39.830
David Schaich (he): which is less then yes, see

238
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.980
David Schaich (he): which should cause us to worry

239
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.180
David Schaich (he): the you.

240
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.670
David Schaich (he): Resolution to

241
00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.090
David Schaich (he): the calculation at this

242
00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.590
more stringent level approximation

243
00:23:54.750 --> 00:24:01.780
David Schaich (he): is to add, in the very highly suppressed contributions from

244
00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:11.220
David Schaich (he): the possibility that we have different numbers of particles, as well as different mixtures of red and blue

245
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.130
David Schaich (he): on each side of that final system.

246
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.740
David Schaich (he): What's the wall?

247
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.830
David Schaich (he): A logarithmic contribution

248
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:30.170
David Schaich (he): that keeps the second law of thermodynamics obeyed

249
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:39.450
David Schaich (he): and can be carried out in the same sort of way that we've gone through here. So go on

250
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.300
David Schaich (he): a bit too long about this All

251
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.420
David Schaich (he): how to see if everyone is happy with it.

252
00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.920
David Schaich (he): That sort of results from

253
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:55.670
David Schaich (he): last week's mixing entropy, activity.

254
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:20.860
David Schaich (he): and I will. We move on to the next thing I you what to mention, as in the side, one

255
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:28.560
David Schaich (he): concept or an idea that you might have encountered before. Which is

256
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.370
it goes by the name of the Max

257
00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:33.860
David Schaich (he): a

258
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:38.040
David Schaich (he): called Experiment, that James with Maxwell

259
00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.890
David Schaich (he): came up with mid 18 hundreds.

260
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.990
1,867.

261
00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:55.840
David Schaich (he): So, carrying out these considerations even before the concept of thermodynamic ensemble had been.

262
00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:04.090
David Schaich (he): will be formalized mathematically. People realize that empirically

263
00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:16.870
David Schaich (he): guesses would all would tend to mix into a disorder of states, and not unmix themselves into the other direction. So it would be unnatural

264
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.750
David Schaich (he): for

265
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.870
David Schaich (he): a mixed state like this final state to

266
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:28.370
David Schaich (he): turn into an initial state. We have that area of time that we've seen before Maxwell. Imagine well what it

267
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.020
David Schaich (he): we have some.

268
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:42.410
David Schaich (he): So what he called demon, which is a called. You can think of this as just some mechanical device that is able to choose what particles to let through.

269
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:46.190
David Schaich (he): of all dividing our usual 2 subsystems.

270
00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:58.740
David Schaich (he): So in our case it this device sees a red particle, it doesn't move on to the left. If the device is a blue particle, that's it through on the right. and in that way they can reverse the early time

271
00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:05.640
David Schaich (he): unmixed these gases, and in a lot of understanding, reduce the entropy and violate that second wall

272
00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:07.160
David Schaich (he): of thermodynamics

273
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:23.730
David Schaich (he): In the illustration shown here, which is more in line with what actually was thinking rather than labeling particles as red. And we were talking about their entropy, which was a concept that wasn't

274
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:32.050
David Schaich (he): really in place at the time he introduced this idea he figured that this device might last

275
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:41.640
David Schaich (he): energetic, fast moving particles into the left hand system B of the slower moving blue, or the color particles going to the system a.

276
00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:55.160
David Schaich (he): And this code introduce a spontaneous all temperature difference. We would have an unnatural heat flow from a cold system to a cost system

277
00:27:55.350 --> 00:28:07.280
David Schaich (he): and generate Hey, You temperature on one side greater than the temperature out the other, which could then be put into a heat engine and use to to do work

278
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:18.060
David Schaich (he): so you can get work or power from nothing. The basic idea of the professional motion machine, the second wall of thermodynamics for this by saying.

279
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:24.710
David Schaich (he): Not only can't we win with thermodynamic cycles, we can't even break even.

280
00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.000
David Schaich (he): and the basic

281
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.160
David Schaich (he): argument.

282
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:34.190
David Schaich (he): So

283
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.510
David Schaich (he): in the context of Maxwell's email.

284
00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.480
David Schaich (he): I would say conceptual arguments

285
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:52.110
David Schaich (he): that any device that accomplishes

286
00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.380
David Schaich (he): this

287
00:28:54.340 --> 00:29:03.790
David Schaich (he): stated goal of unmixing gases and putting particles with certain properties on one side. Those are other properties; on the other.

288
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:08.150
David Schaich (he): The

289
00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:20.390
David Schaich (he): activities of this demon or device have have their own interview cost.

290
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.700
David Schaich (he): So if we look at the

291
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:30.010
David Schaich (he): one system. oh.

292
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.430
David Schaich (he): the demon for the device interacting with these gases.

293
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:38.120
David Schaich (he): We also have to account for

294
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.230
David Schaich (he): the entropy, you

295
00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:44.070
David Schaich (he): of the activities of this device itself.

296
00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:58.650
David Schaich (he): which part of the whole and these activities themselves, and a certain amount of entropy as a result of whatever it needs to be done. In order to do this division, and lower the energy of the gases themselves.

297
00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:59.640
David Schaich (he): So

298
00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.740
that's

299
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.350
David Schaich (he): that leaves the second law.

300
00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:13.120
David Schaich (he): Okay? And this conceptual argument has actually been

301
00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.720
David Schaich (he): checked in

302
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.160
David Schaich (he): practice much more recently.

303
00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:25.450
David Schaich (he): So our technological capabilities. So what

304
00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.320
David Schaich (he): exceed those available in the 1860 S.

305
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:39.650
David Schaich (he): And there are actually quite a few examples of

306
00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.200
they're called demon experience.

307
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.880
David Schaich (he): That's

308
00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:56.200
David Schaich (he): uses these sorts of devices to carry out in the case of

309
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.970
David Schaich (he): this illustration, by

310
00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:06.930
David Schaich (he): encouraging a particle to move to a state where it has more potential energy.

311
00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:09.000
we use to do work.

312
00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:18.010
David Schaich (he): So this is a conceptual illustration of experiments by the Japanese group.

313
00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:24.580
David Schaich (he): It's all about Well, years ago published in 2,010,

314
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:32.830
David Schaich (he): so they are using lasers to

315
00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.980
David Schaich (he): track particles in

316
00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:40.150
David Schaich (he): such a way that when a particle fluctuates.

317
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.650
David Schaich (he): thanks with thermal energy to

318
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:47.910
David Schaich (he): a state with that higher potential energy, the laser is readjusted to

319
00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:52.580
David Schaich (he): track that particle in that higher energy stage. This is repeated

320
00:31:53.240 --> 00:32:04.060
David Schaich (he): over and over again, which causes that particle to effectively roll up a staircase any more potential energy that can then be used to do work.

321
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:08.900
David Schaich (he): And I said that registration aside.

322
00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.040
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

323
00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:26.250
David Schaich (he): Give you the understand from it. If you do a careful accounting out of what happens to the lasers that you have to manipulates in order to put these crafts into place.

324
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:36.860
David Schaich (he): This procedure adds entropy to universe through those

325
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.840
David Schaich (he): users themselves.

326
00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:43.080
David Schaich (he): and the second law

327
00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:48.790
David Schaich (he): is obeyed. And if you are curious about this. I've added to

328
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.760
David Schaich (he): the extra resources on me.

329
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:55.590
David Schaich (he): Can this module a relatively recent

330
00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:02.900
David Schaich (he): article about it from the physics today. Magazine from

331
00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:09.150
David Schaich (he): November 2011. So, about 15 months ago, the demons haunting thermodynamics

332
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.120
David Schaich (he): which

333
00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:20.630
David Schaich (he): some experiments in their real realizations in modern day experiments.

334
00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.550
David Schaich (he): So any questions about Maxwell's team in the second of all.

335
00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:31.850
David Schaich (he): or entropy before we move on to the promise

336
00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:42.320
David Schaich (he): through a dynamic cycle application that I saying we would do today. We have enough time to get back introduced in under way.

337
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.860
David Schaich (he): Good.

338
00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.060
David Schaich (he): Let's move on to what the

339
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:13.290
David Schaich (he): new activity for you to play with over the coming week, which is to consider it the thermodynamic cycle defined by this

340
00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:17.000
David Schaich (he): on the screen.

341
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.920
David Schaich (he): This is known as the Auto Cycle.

342
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:31.120
David Schaich (he): named after his his name Auto, and

343
00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:43.290
David Schaich (he): differs in a few important ways from the Our No cycle that we looked at in the lecture. One thing it is a a great deal more recent

344
00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:53.370
David Schaich (he): sort of introduced around the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. and its main role is actually as a model of

345
00:34:54.540 --> 00:35:02.260
David Schaich (he): an ideal, a realization of how petrol engines so internal combustion engines. What

346
00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:09.540
David Schaich (he): So the idea is if we start at like one in this Pv diagram.

347
00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:15.140
David Schaich (he): we carrying out some compression of our gas.

348
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:18.160
David Schaich (he): That is

349
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:34.170
David Schaich (he): a real real process, and occurs pretty rapidly. If you think about How many times per minute do you internal combustion engine in there a call or a bus?

350
00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.090
David Schaich (he): It goes through its cycle.

351
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:45.150
David Schaich (he): You can appreciate just how quickly this compression is being. This whole cycle is being carried out.

352
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:50.400
David Schaich (he): so that compression increases the pressure of

353
00:35:51.030 --> 00:36:02.450
David Schaich (he): the gas as we've seen before idiotic procedures. and I should mention, before going any further, that the Yes

354
00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.370
David Schaich (he): be considered in this cycle

355
00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:08.240
David Schaich (he): is actually a

356
00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.840
David Schaich (he): mixture of air

357
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:17.110
David Schaich (he): and vaporized control

358
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:23.040
David Schaich (he): it. Once the

359
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:29.940
David Schaich (he): volume is reduced to this V. 2 from the starting one. You're going to be one

360
00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.460
David Schaich (he): at point 2.

361
00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.370
David Schaich (he): A spark is introduced

362
00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:40.840
David Schaich (he): to the system that he heights this mix of air and the petrol.

363
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:51.130
David Schaich (he): and it's very rapidly. does a large amount of heat into the gas essentially, instantaneously So here it is.

364
00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.680
David Schaich (he): hey

365
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.200
David Schaich (he): addition of heat from the submission stage burning the petrol.

366
00:36:58.350 --> 00:36:59.110
David Schaich (he): yes.

367
00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:04.580
David Schaich (he): goes into the gas so quickly that the volume does not have any time to change.

368
00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:06.690
David Schaich (he): and even though the

369
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:11.660
David Schaich (he): gas itself is perfect to introduce the seeds and raise the temperature.

370
00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:23.990
David Schaich (he): which in turn raises the pressure from the We can't still model this and think about it as Keith, coming in from some external from a reservoir

371
00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:32.220
David Schaich (he): just happening very quickly at a fixed volume over the next instance the volume is able to expand.

372
00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:37.650
David Schaich (he): This drives the gears and the wheels on the car provide the power and work.

373
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:42.120
David Schaich (he): This is another. We have the process kind of Adiabatic expansion.

374
00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:48.380
David Schaich (he): and then, finally, the hot broadcast is

375
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:53.440
David Schaich (he): produce. Exhaust is expelled from the system. and

376
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.650
David Schaich (he): an equal number of

377
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:06.820
David Schaich (he): fresh fuel particles. Another, a new mixture of

378
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:20.340
David Schaich (he): petrol is brought in to replace that burns exhaust which lowers the temperature of the system, closes the cycle and gets us back to that starting part of wall.

379
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:27.720
David Schaich (he): So video question if you will consider

380
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.480
David Schaich (he): we've given a

381
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:33.530
David Schaich (he): thermodynamic cycle

382
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:44.410
David Schaich (he): is, what is this efficiency? And in particular, how is that efficiency? Compare

383
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.460
David Schaich (he): to the efficiency of the Carnot cycle.

384
00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.440
David Schaich (he): So that is

385
00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:14.960
David Schaich (he): something for you to work out just in the start of the last 10 min. See? Make sure you can get under way. I'm around. If there are immediate questions that I can pull up instead of just handwritten, those the

386
00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:18.400
David Schaich (he): activity itself also from

387
00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:20.530
David Schaich (he): I can this site.

388
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:26.650
David Schaich (he): So there is the cycle, the description of those 4 phases. and

389
00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:41.060
David Schaich (he): I forgot to mention this useful concept of compression ratio. The ratio of the 2 volume set up here is here. It's a larger volume on top, so that R. Is greater than one

390
00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:47.880
David Schaich (he): which will appear in the efficiency of the auto cycle.

391
00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:52.730
David Schaich (he): and you want to compute that and compare it to

392
00:39:52.760 --> 00:40:03.580
David Schaich (he): the Carnot cycle. which we've already computed earlier this week. The efficiency it, a. C of the Carnot cycle is one minus the temperature ratio

393
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:08.540
David Schaich (he): at the coldest points. One versus the hottest points 3

394
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:14.590
David Schaich (he): so always between 0 and one, and turning off when

395
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:19.680
David Schaich (he): pull the top become the same temperature. So i'll pause the recording.

396
00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.130
David Schaich (he): I need this to you for

397
00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:27.830
David Schaich (he): okay, I'll just resume the recording for the last minute here to

398
00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:34.570
David Schaich (he): questions or ambiguities about this

399
00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:36.890
David Schaich (he): activity for the coming week.

400
00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.150
David Schaich (he): Not seeing any objections or concerns, I

401
00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:47.970
4

402
00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.160
David Schaich (he): remotely

403
00:40:50.600 --> 00:41:02.400
David Schaich (he): something that in the mission earlier in that perhaps should have, was the suggestion that I think came up in the lecture that a good place to start is to figure out which of these

404
00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:08.180
David Schaich (he): cycles is actually contributing to

405
00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:15.620
David Schaich (he): the efficiency which is doing work which requires for it to be done. I wish we was.

406
00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.370
David Schaich (he): you know, like he's

407
00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:23.160
David Schaich (he): into the system, and all the other

408
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:30.450
David Schaich (he): contributions are going to work or teach. and then you ignored it. The goal of computing this efficiency, which

409
00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:38.560
David Schaich (he): check in all that it's time next week, just before we turn right. so

410
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.780
David Schaich (he): last call for it

411
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:47.380
David Schaich (he): questions as I'll shut things down and head off to

412
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.090
David Schaich (he): today's office hours.
