1
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.860
David Schaich (he): Okay, we may as well get underway,

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.210
David Schaich (he): approaching the term break.

3
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.510
David Schaich (he): On the 23rd of March the magic number is 1, 5, 9, 5, 2, 0.

4
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.930
David Schaich (he): And the

5
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.330
David Schaich (he): play for today is first for me to ask if you have any questions or anything you want to discuss in this tutorial.

6
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.700
David Schaich (he): You have the freedom to raise any issues here.

7
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.220
David Schaich (he): And if you don't have

8
00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.000
David Schaich (he): nominations, I have some ideas myself: A couple of comments

9
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.640
David Schaich (he): on the homework for which feedback went back earlier this week.

10
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.520
David Schaich (he): And then wrapping up the activity on

11
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.780
David Schaich (he): thermodynamic cycles we introduced last week. So

12
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.440
David Schaich (he): comparing the Otto cycle to the Carnot cycle and introducing the Diesel cycle.

13
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.400
David Schaich (he): And I want to give you

14
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.790
David Schaich (he): something more to play with during the break, in addition to

15
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.470
David Schaich (he): lecture notes and past exams

16
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.990
David Schaich (he): that are on the Canvas site I have uploaded another tutorial activity on

17
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.780
David Schaich (he): basically models of sounds, so getting back to some heat capacity results that

18
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.290
David Schaich (he): the first day of the term

19
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.600
David Schaich (he): at least first the

20
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.260
David Schaich (he): so model for how to

21
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.000
David Schaich (he): So it out further to.

22
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.980
David Schaich (he): There is 2 issues related to

23
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.290
yeah.

24
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.540
David Schaich (he): 4 more questions. So the

25
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.460
David Schaich (he): pretty good, on average bit of a spread that some people did very well

26
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.370
David Schaich (he): One thing that nobody attempted, at least on their submission that I saw was to figure out

27
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.060
David Schaich (he): the time of the accidents

28
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.680
David Schaich (he): first question.

29
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.410
David Schaich (he): Perhaps you did that separately or after

30
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.140
David Schaich (he): I did one after that computer project. But it was

31
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.650
David Schaich (he): one issue for a few folks on the

32
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.450
David Schaich (he): first question the parts that we actually assess

33
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:24.900
David Schaich (he): which is the relation between the central theorem and probabilities. That central limit, theorem or clt

34
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.370
David Schaich (he): to you is

35
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.960
David Schaich (he): the probability

36
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.510
David Schaich (he): distribution P. Of X: okay.

37
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.270
David Schaich (he): and then extracting actual probabilities

38
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.490
David Schaich (he): themselves.

39
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.170
David Schaich (he): Yeah, this for you, shit. One

40
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.570
David Schaich (he): needs to be integrated over the relevant range.

41
00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:06.750
David Schaich (he): So the probability for a it's the of that distribution.

42
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.560
David Schaich (he): and

43
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.149
David Schaich (he): that is sort of the

44
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:24.610
David Schaich (he): measurements that are fractions of some total amount of radioactive material. Interpret them as such. And then

45
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.260
David Schaich (he): those fractions are just the probability that each individual

46
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.960
David Schaich (he): reactor

47
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.130
David Schaich (he): as travel a certain distance in a certain time.

48
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.290
David Schaich (he): And because we have 2 measurements, we can.

49
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:48.600
David Schaich (he): we get to these snapshots of the same distribution as it has evolved one time to the next.

50
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.110
David Schaich (he): We can call that

51
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.430
David Schaich (he): so. Time to you.

52
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.900
David Schaich (he): A second

53
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.430
David Schaich (he): measurements is 3 and a half hours later.

54
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.500
David Schaich (he): You call that

55
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.490
David Schaich (he): t Prime said initial time plus a delta t

56
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.550
David Schaich (he): 6, 3 utc. To 10.

57
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.300
David Schaich (he): So in order for these 2 snapshots to both come from the same distribution.

58
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:37.120
David Schaich (he): We can delete. They come from that same probability distribution just for a different number of the time. So the

59
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:47.330
David Schaich (he): integral. There you go once. It was from there 1,100 kilometer distance

60
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.230
David Schaich (he): next to my show. Oh, okay.

61
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.460
usual.

62
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.710
David Schaich (he): The expression

63
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.520
David Schaich (he): squared.

64
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.780
David Schaich (he): d squared, integrated over X.

65
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.080
David Schaich (he): The later time

66
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.680
David Schaich (he): this fraction is 500, 84 times larger there

67
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.640
David Schaich (he): the fraction of that earlier time t year, that same

68
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.230
David Schaich (he): integral from

69
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.220
David Schaich (he): 0, 2, sorry from has to infinity.

70
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:39.260
David Schaich (he): So all we have to do to determine the time of the accident is to

71
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.110
David Schaich (he): solve this equation 14, which is

72
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.470
David Schaich (he): not exactly straightforward.

73
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:59.660
David Schaich (he): So these T's are hiding both the

74
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:11.560
David Schaich (he): if we carry out the same change of variables that we usually do for yeah caption distribution for the you're in the crime.

75
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.600
David Schaich (he): Excellent. This

76
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:29.530
David Schaich (he): you know, ours. P. Squared. Then we can relate this integral from X to infinity, to

77
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:35.370
David Schaich (he): the difference between integrals, from 0 to infinity integrals from 0 to x.

78
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.200
David Schaich (he): One of those is

79
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:43.920
David Schaich (he): one up to a constant factor of the other gives the error function. So on both sides we have

80
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.970
David Schaich (he): one minus that error function of

81
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:56.770
David Schaich (he): change, the variable you at the appropriate

82
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.160
David Schaich (he): with again a ratio of

83
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.510
David Schaich (he): 584.

84
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:23.570
David Schaich (he): So that is the expression so complements of error, functions, difference between one and your function itself we want to

85
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.000
extract from that. Yeah.

86
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:39.860
David Schaich (he): In my opinion, my my favorite way of doing so is actually just to plot both sides of this equation and look for intersections between those 2 sides, which is

87
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.799
David Schaich (he): what is going on in

88
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:55.470
David Schaich (he): this piece of code that I have uploaded to canvas the results of this code that the code itself is doing is computing the error function complement. Oh.

89
00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:06.840
David Schaich (he): the 2 expressions. We just wrote down 2 T. D. Squared and 2 T. Prime V. Squared. Follow the cost of factors fixed up above.

90
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:18.650
David Schaich (he): and if we scan from 10 to 100 h we can expect to see some intersection in that range. If not, we just adjust the range.

91
00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.560
David Schaich (he): and

92
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.140
David Schaich (he): there is, after about.

93
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.630
David Schaich (he): or just before the 60 h. Mark The

94
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:37.760
David Schaich (he): probabilities with the costing factor that we get from both sides are consistent with each other at that time, just below 60, which we can

95
00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:49.660
David Schaich (he): zoom in on to see an intersection around 57 or alternately. Take the difference between those 2 error function complements with that

96
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:56.900
David Schaich (he): overall factor of 584, and feed that into a

97
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:01.930
David Schaich (he): root. Finding algorithm. I I provides one other program. Languages provide others.

98
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.400
David Schaich (he): And this gives us

99
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:08.600
David Schaich (he): a miracle for the time. and essentially

100
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.980
David Schaich (he): does the same sort of thing rather than looking at the intersection. It says the difference to 0

101
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:21.860
David Schaich (he): in fines 57 h duration between

102
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:26.610
David Schaich (he): the incident and the first measurements, in order for the 2 measurements to

103
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.270
David Schaich (he): be self-consistent

104
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.490
David Schaich (he): so

105
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.250
David Schaich (he): that is the sort of thing that

106
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:37.820
David Schaich (he): people back in

107
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.890
David Schaich (he): go through to estimate not only how much was released, but also when it was released.

108
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.780
David Schaich (he): that was having to wait too long for

109
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.990
David Schaich (he): a significant chunk of the fraction to accumulate. That's rapid information

110
00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:00.660
David Schaich (he): as best as they can get in a quick and dirty way as soon as we along the circle of all.

111
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.460
David Schaich (he): and that is the sort of procedure that would have been following.

112
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.350
David Schaich (he): and the benefits that

113
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:23.230
David Schaich (he): just a few hours gives us the ability to time and the amount.

114
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.430
so that

115
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.880
David Schaich (he): there are any questions

116
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:35.640
David Schaich (he): that

117
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.990
David Schaich (he): Yeah, this is essentially what

118
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.010
David Schaich (he): that python code does.

119
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.980
David Schaich (he): It is so. It is possible to

120
00:11:55.210 --> 00:12:01.270
David Schaich (he): approximately solve this sort of thing by hand, just by putting it in an appropriate expansion

121
00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.630
David Schaich (he): in small factors. and that it becomes

122
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.030
David Schaich (he): quickly complicated.

123
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.070
David Schaich (he): And

124
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.970
David Schaich (he): yes, this sort of thing you would do perfectly well

125
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:20.030
David Schaich (he): you could. I would get a very rough estimate from like a leading order of expansion. Just say that it's gone up by a factor of 503 h.

126
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:30.030
David Schaich (he): and try to look backwards with a simple power walk from there. But what's more, what people actually would have done. They are very familiar with the error function. They are

127
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.850
David Schaich (he): back before the you guys.

128
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:46.200
David Schaich (he): They were actually books published with tables of values of the error function for. Yeah. the whole thing as this argument varies, we have pages and pages of what is the error function for

129
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.180
David Schaich (he): this particular argument? You can figure that out easily

130
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.180
David Schaich (he): from estimates of

131
00:12:53.880 --> 00:13:01.110
David Schaich (he): he is going into here. and then to see where that compliment

132
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:06.320
David Schaich (he): differs by that factor of 500 from the 2 meetings in your book are

133
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.020
3 and a half hours apart.

134
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.600
David Schaich (he): or

135
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:15.260
David Schaich (he): they did have in 86. There were computers that would be able to

136
00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:24.410
David Schaich (he): produce these sorts of thoughts, or at least the data going into them. So this is probably more realistic. What people actually did

137
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.820
David Schaich (he): in order to solve that equation. It is so numerically rather than

138
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:34.230
David Schaich (he): give me a closed form. Expressions all the time. Yes.

139
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:40.590
David Schaich (he): all the 2 curves from the 2 measurements that are consistent with diffusion of radioactivity

140
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:53.030
David Schaich (he): in the atmosphere, with approximations and assumptions that we have discussed. and then see in round numbers where they are consistent, you know, 57 h is probably more precise than

141
00:13:53.400 --> 00:14:00.010
David Schaich (he): they would have been comfortable. Relying on. they more likely would have said 2 to 3 days.

142
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.670
David Schaich (he): as round numbers, which would then give an order of magnitude

143
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.990
David Schaich (he): for the overall amount.

144
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:10.910
There you go.

145
00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:12.610
David Schaich (he): That

146
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.420
David Schaich (he): in the solution should have pre loaded

147
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:27.980
David Schaich (he): in here

148
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.010
David Schaich (he): I can get to canvas without having to

149
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:42.460
David Schaich (he): go through too many. This is a tool factor application. I was.

150
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.350
David Schaich (he): You'd be interested to see

151
00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.690
David Schaich (he): what

152
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:57.910
David Schaich (he): all of you identify it as the impact of the approximations that were used in that first question.

153
00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:06.080
David Schaich (he): So I put 4 fairly significant ones in my model solutions.

154
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.280
David Schaich (he): and I think the majority of submissions latched onto

155
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.340
David Schaich (he): the approximation of

156
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:21.860
David Schaich (he): using just a one-dimensional random walk for particles that were really diffusing in 3 dimensions. So they they're being more room generally, and

157
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:32.610
David Schaich (he): a certain direction by the dominant wings. But there is from that diffusion the possibility of the product is spreading out

158
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:42.460
David Schaich (he): on either side of that direction is picked out by the wind. There can be variations in the wind as time goes on, whereas the particles rise and fall in the atmosphere.

159
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:43.750
David Schaich (he): and

160
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:45.620
David Schaich (he): I think

161
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.290
David Schaich (he): this first bullet point is sort of the obvious approximation.

162
00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:53.060
David Schaich (he): Yeah. clearly leads to an underestimation of the particles.

163
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:57.080
David Schaich (he): Drift off to the sides of our detector. To say, we only pick up

164
00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:07.920
David Schaich (he): a portion of them. and we can be confident that what we see is only representing a small fraction of what was released. So the

165
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.880
David Schaich (he): amount that those exceptions.

166
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:26.280
David Schaich (he): at least, as I have presented them with a bit of clean up from the the mess of your situation. good presence in real life. Give us this estimate of order of magnitude. 10 to the 16

167
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.160
David Schaich (he): it's a

168
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:32.840
David Schaich (he): small number. It's something that can be compared to

169
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:37.450
David Schaich (he): how many radioactive particles you have.

170
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.510
David Schaich (he): and that turned out to be

171
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.640
David Schaich (he): a few orders of magnitude

172
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.210
David Schaich (he): smaller than the true amount

173
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.780
that was released, which wasn't really.

174
00:16:49.660 --> 00:17:01.840
David Schaich (he): I count the figured out for actually years following the accident, probably because the Soviet authorities a great deal of information about it

175
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:12.589
David Schaich (he): only when they had to. But we didn't threaten to file a a raise the law with the International Atomic Energy Agency. That was

176
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:19.589
David Schaich (he): the threat that the only thing that forces so even to admit that there have been an incident, in the first place, let alone

177
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.099
David Schaich (he): how severe it was. But

178
00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:29.460
David Schaich (he): if one person mentioned the issue of radioactive fallout, which is a fun one, because

179
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:30.680
David Schaich (he): when

180
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.060
David Schaich (he): radioactive particles hit the ground

181
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.540
David Schaich (he): they stick there and actually stop

182
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:48.370
David Schaich (he): diffusing or stop the random walk in the atmosphere or so, the processes that we're able to model very well as a random walk, thanks to the large number of particles

183
00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:54.360
David Schaich (he): and the large number of steps that those particles are taking as they bounce off each other in the air.

184
00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:08.590
David Schaich (he): and something that we don't get into in this module that is, to the very one mathematically is random walks that end when they certain conditions say this comes up a lot actually in stock markets.

185
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:15.760
David Schaich (he): So some of you might have encountered it if you've taken financial maths modules in this department.

186
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:27.700
David Schaich (he): If a sock price it's a certain value like 0, and the company goes back to the stock no longer is is fluctuating. and there's

187
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:34.840
David Schaich (he): because, partly because it has such importance in finance, there's a lot of mathematics that has been developed around

188
00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:39.160
David Schaich (he): the so called first passage processes. So the first time

189
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:48.060
David Schaich (he): the process passes a certain threshold. it changes, or it stops, which is where that term comes from. She is

190
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:54.870
David Schaich (he): more complicated to analyze mathematically, but perhaps more interesting for those same reasons.

191
00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.170
David Schaich (he): And then the 2 other issues here. Some of them

192
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:12.610
David Schaich (he): require, They assume on it familiar with radioactive the fact that as we're they cease being radioactive. So the amount of radioactivity

193
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.430
David Schaich (he): decreases over time.

194
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.110
David Schaich (he): And if we actually look at the particular

195
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:28.740
David Schaich (he): types of radioactivity that were released at Chernobyl. A big chunk of it had a radioactive half-life of about 3 and a half hours.

196
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:33.550
David Schaich (he): So by the time 50 h have passed. That's maybe 15 min

197
00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:39.750
David Schaich (he): of those half lives. So all but one over, 2 to the fifteenth

198
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:48.470
David Schaich (he): fraction of that way you like to would have okay, since the to the 15 is

199
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.650
David Schaich (he): what is that? 32,000

200
00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.670
David Schaich (he): and round numbers so

201
00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.010
David Schaich (he): less than 0 point, one per mill of at least that

202
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:10.490
David Schaich (he): radioactive component would have survived long enough to make it to those detections. So more was released at the start. All of these are giving

203
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:16.140
David Schaich (he): under estimates that you third one here being the fact that

204
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:21.290
David Schaich (he): regular activity was not released all at once at the time of the action of the accident.

205
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:27.380
David Schaich (he): started the release which actually persisted for more than a week.

206
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.710
David Schaich (he): See if I can

207
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.600
David Schaich (he): hold up this report by the

208
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.230
David Schaich (he): with your energy agency

209
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.790
David Schaich (he): 1995 it was updated in 2,002. But

210
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:51.150
David Schaich (he): most of the basic data, like the figure I have in line was unchanged.

211
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.340
David Schaich (he): which

212
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.510
David Schaich (he): I go constant.

213
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.410
David Schaich (he): There it is.

214
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.130
David Schaich (he): Let's see your way to

215
00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:10.280
David Schaich (he): it that to fill the screen. But hopefully, it's

216
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.780
David Schaich (he): big enough to be visible. This is the amount of release

217
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:23.020
David Schaich (he): versus the days after the initial accident so a big peak from the accident itself.

218
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.260
David Schaich (he): and then

219
00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.770
David Schaich (he): a smaller amount to about one-third to

220
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:39.160
David Schaich (he): two-thirds of that initial amount was coming from fires that burned uncontrollably for more than a week after the accident. largely because they were being driven by

221
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:46.030
David Schaich (he): yeah radioactive chain reaction at the core. and basically the fire only stopped from the court.

222
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.920
David Schaich (he): built it through the foundation of the plans, and sink down into the earth.

223
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:55.790
David Schaich (he): which happened on that the tenth day, the fourth of May

224
00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.870
David Schaich (he): in 1,986. Anyway, I've gone to

225
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:16.420
David Schaich (he): that first question. Move on to any new material for today. I think for you. First question was the most challenging one for folks in terms of the marks that came out of the second question.

226
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:25.990
David Schaich (he): Probably. Have you highest average, If I call it correctly the 70 for all 3 questions.

227
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:37.930
David Schaich (he): The temptation in the second question, which is about systems of positive and negative temperatures coming into thermal contact with each other, without

228
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:46.090
David Schaich (he): actually giving you any information about the relative sizes of those 2 systems for the same or different. So it's.

229
00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:53.740
David Schaich (he): It's only the most general statement they can be made that amount of information and

230
00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.090
David Schaich (he): an example of that. Some folks were

231
00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:04.800
David Schaich (he): kind of sensibly attempted to make, just based on everyday experience

232
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:05.940
David Schaich (he): is that

233
00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:08.770
David Schaich (he): to paraphrase.

234
00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.290
yeah.

235
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:11.780
David Schaich (he): heat, exchange

236
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.280
David Schaich (he): the call, see

237
00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:18.460
David Schaich (he): temperatures to come into agreement or to

238
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:28.060
David Schaich (he): closer to each other. So here positive temperature system with the higher temperature we all are

239
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:36.350
David Schaich (he): go to a lower temperature or the negative temperature system. It's the lower temperature. We go to a higher temperature, how it will come together.

240
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:49.350
David Schaich (he): That's what happens when we have to natural systems with positive temperatures and different magnitude which we saw in the class. It's actually the opposite of what happens.

241
00:23:49.990 --> 00:24:00.480
David Schaich (he): and systems with negative temperatures as to find from statistical physics and micro economic ensemble. And

242
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.450
David Schaich (he): it actually happens.

243
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:05.620
David Schaich (he): is it for you

244
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.620
David Schaich (he): temperatures move farther apart.

245
00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:18.270
David Schaich (he): in the sense that the negative temperature becomes more negative, and the positive temperature becomes more positive.

246
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:20.580
David Schaich (he): and

247
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.520
David Schaich (he): so appreciate that with

248
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:26.700
David Schaich (he): visuals reloaded

249
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.830
David Schaich (he): here as well so, rather than

250
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:36.330
David Schaich (he): drawing some of the plots of the answers for this this is the expression for the entropy.

251
00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:47.350
David Schaich (he): for that microcanonical system which may look familiar. This x is the number of particles with non-zero energy epsilon. so that corresponds to

252
00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:50.690
David Schaich (he): the total energy e over that small epsilon.

253
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:54.970
David Schaich (he): I've just given us a 1 million particles to look at things numerically.

254
00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.220
David Schaich (he): and the entropy is

255
00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.950
putting in that leading order sterling approximation and log in

256
00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.160
David Schaich (he): minus.

257
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:13.130
David Schaich (he): and one or Epsilon or E. Over Epsilon Log, E over Epsilon, and then the difference and minus X Times, the volume of N. Minus X.

258
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.840
David Schaich (he): It looks like this

259
00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:20.560
David Schaich (he): something we've seen before with an earlier tutorial; and

260
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.670
David Schaich (he): when there is, and roughly even mix between

261
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.940
David Schaich (he): the degrees of freedom with

262
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:34.830
David Schaich (he): each value of the energy in this case under 0 or epsilon, we get a maximum entropy

263
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.550
David Schaich (he): when that energy goes to 0. There's only one way to

264
00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.290
have a

265
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:51.020
David Schaich (he): There's only one microstate with the minimum energy, or with the maximum energy. So all particles with 0 energy, or all all particles with

266
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:59.260
David Schaich (he): absolute energy. And the log of that one Microsoft 0. So the interview looks like this. If we take the derivative

267
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:08.000
David Schaich (he): of this S versus E. We see that derivative. it was through 0 at the maximum of the entropy right, indeed.

268
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.800
David Schaich (he): middle of the range there

269
00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:12.590
David Schaich (he): from 0 to the

270
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.700
David Schaich (he): whole amount of energy, we can have kind of the number of particles.

271
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:20.890
David Schaich (he): and if we invert that to get the temperature itself.

272
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:27.210
David Schaich (he): Then there is this diversions, and most people correctly identify that energy would flow

273
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:38.230
David Schaich (he): problem the system with more. but with a greater amount of energy to the system, with the smaller amount of energy. So more energy corresponds to

274
00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.660
David Schaich (he): that temperature below 0.

275
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.110
David Schaich (he): And then the

276
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:48.840
most interesting thing, at least for me about this process is

277
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.940
David Schaich (he): so negative temperature system.

278
00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:59.080
David Schaich (he): the

279
00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:05.130
David Schaich (he): to the left of this curve. you know to be positive

280
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:15.060
David Schaich (he): that the there you go

281
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:16.440
there is.

282
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:20.420
David Schaich (he): and the difference between them actually diverges in

283
00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:25.110
David Schaich (he): that thermodynamic limits. When we have an infinite number of particles.

284
00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:35.410
David Schaich (he): it's there's a very sharp cut off, and the transition from positive to negative. In the case of a finite or large number of

285
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:39.860
that we're not quite seeing, because of that solid base approximation.

286
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.850
David Schaich (he): But that's the way that negative temperatures are unnatural

287
00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.610
David Schaich (he): compared to our intuition one way.

288
00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:57.220
David Schaich (he): So if we, when we look at solids

289
00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:07.010
David Schaich (he): and compute their key capacity have the same sort of spin system that allows for negative temperatures. You will also see strange behaviors and

290
00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:11.650
David Schaich (he): the heat capacity, even when the temperature is positive

291
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.940
David Schaich (he): about the homework, unless there are

292
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.570
David Schaich (he): further questions.

293
00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:26.590
David Schaich (he): Transition to you. Tutorial activity on the

294
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.750
David Schaich (he): had to play with over the past week.

295
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.090
David Schaich (he): and I can

296
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:39.470
David Schaich (he): ask with, not on the clock. how well

297
00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:46.280
David Schaich (he): you felt about the results that you got for the efficiency

298
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:49.540
David Schaich (he): of this cycle. This comparison to

299
00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.770
David Schaich (he): the so

300
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.530
David Schaich (he): I don't know if anyone either online or in the room.

301
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:59.010
David Schaich (he): It's confident to like. Shout out the efficiency for

302
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.540
David Schaich (he): the auto cycle that you found if you found it.

303
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:17.350
David Schaich (he): and if not, if there were. challenges, a

304
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:23.590
David Schaich (he): quickly sketch through the calculations to give some guidance.

305
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.070
David Schaich (he): and

306
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.690
David Schaich (he): so commentary on

307
00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.440
David Schaich (he): how the result comes out, and what it implies for

308
00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:40.100
David Schaich (he): how to make internal combustion engines and efficient as possible.

309
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.390
David Schaich (he): like you were tempted to say something.

310
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.100
David Schaich (he): No.

311
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:56.950
David Schaich (he): that is perfectly fine.

312
00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.700
David Schaich (he): What we can do to

313
00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:02.870
David Schaich (he): go through this efficiency calculation is

314
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:09.240
David Schaich (he): quickly as possible. This is the version of that Pv diagram to the auto cycle of that.

315
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.490
David Schaich (he): We looked at last week.

316
00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:16.170
David Schaich (he): and a good place to start

317
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:20.100
David Schaich (he): in. Any computation of the efficiency is figure out

318
00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:29.390
David Schaich (he): which of the stages in the cycle are relevant for the 3 pieces that go into determine the efficiency

319
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:36.210
David Schaich (he): work, that by the system, the work done on the system and the that flips into the system.

320
00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:38.670
David Schaich (he): So last week we solve that

321
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.810
David Schaich (he): Just keep going in

322
00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:47.740
David Schaich (he): comes only in the admission stage when the gas is burned and a large amount of heat comes from. We

323
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:52.790
David Schaich (he): combustion of that mix of air and petrol.

324
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:55.140
David Schaich (he): I full paper.

325
00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:58.960
David Schaich (he): and the work

326
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:06.510
David Schaich (he): before it out and work in are also only done by a single stage. So the power stage. This is Adiabatic Expansion

327
00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:15.580
David Schaich (he): does work on the environment. 2 vertical stages have a fixed volume, so the integral Pv. That defines work is 0,

328
00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:21.200
David Schaich (he): and then the question it's working on the system by the engine.

329
00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:33.890
David Schaich (he): pushing this to smaller volumes. raising its pressure and raising its temperature. So we only have to work. We only have to look at 3 things out of the

330
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.620
David Schaich (he): in principle in this cycle. What work the 2 Adiabatic stages.

331
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:40.990
the heat.

332
00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:55.640
David Schaich (he): one of the video. also volume stages. And we have actually already so any computation of work for Adiabatic expansion and compression.

333
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.190
David Schaich (he): because there are

334
00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:05.400
David Schaich (he): such Adiabatic stages in the Carnot Cycle that they are interspersed with

335
00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:14.920
David Schaich (he): slow isothermal expansion and compression rather than it was constant volume and much faster processes. So

336
00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.330
David Schaich (he): we saw that for

337
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:20.960
David Schaich (he): idiomatic

338
00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.100
David Schaich (he): expansion that does this work out

339
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:30.190
David Schaich (he): negative of the work in that stage from point 3 and 2.4.

340
00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:33.880
David Schaich (he): There is no key flow in there. So this is

341
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:40.520
David Schaich (he): just the negative change in the energy which is. we have nt.

342
00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:48.390
David Schaich (he): and the change in is that final temperature before that's the initial

343
00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.980
David Schaich (he): with an overall data sign.

344
00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.540
David Schaich (he): The work in is the same

345
00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:07.080
David Schaich (he): population going out from temperature, one temperature, 2, so 3 and a half. Yeah. Final temperature.

346
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:14.070
David Schaich (he): And for the he, because there is no work with the constant volume. We also have

347
00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.370
David Schaich (he): same

348
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.700
David Schaich (he): temperature difference now going

349
00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:22.480
2 to 3.

350
00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.890
David Schaich (he): The final temperature of this initial temperature.

351
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:36.960
David Schaich (he): Hey, I do. The efficiency puts all of these together in the factors that free has and will cancel out the numerator.

352
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:40.490
David Schaich (he): We start off with positive W out, which has

353
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:42.800
David Schaich (he): this T. 4.

354
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:59.030
David Schaich (he): So distribute that negative sign we subtract work in. so it's a. T, 2, Let me have it

355
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:08.290
David Schaich (he): 18, 3, minus 2 in the denominator. So t 3, one is t 2, Is it both numerator and a nominator? Those can cancel

356
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:18.889
David Schaich (he): if we pull out a t, 4 of what's left. and have t one over t 4

357
00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:21.790
negative sign.

358
00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.290
David Schaich (he): and

359
00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:24.949
about 2, 3

360
00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:42.980
David Schaich (he): team, 2 over, 2, 3, which and simplify, thanks to idiotic expansion and impression which is realistic. So we give you the processes

361
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:55.710
David Schaich (he): really quick and much our attention that our power to cycle over very quickly thousands of tons per minute. So very

362
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.350
he was going in the Exchange

363
00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:02.660
David Schaich (he): that in the fuel and then expelling it in the exhaust stage.

364
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:06.850
David Schaich (he): So

365
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:17.020
David Schaich (he): v 2 to the 3 halves. So as we go from

366
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:20.980
David Schaich (he): we need to 4 in the cycle that power stage

367
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:28.440
David Schaich (he): the to the 3. No.

368
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:31.080
David Schaich (he): i'm set.

369
00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.770
David Schaich (he): We'll always have a sure we're just rearranging this

370
00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:44.340
David Schaich (he): t 4 over 2 3 that appears in the efficiency

371
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:48.850
David Schaich (he): the wrong ratio

372
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:54.610
David Schaich (he): the 2, over one to that two-thirds power

373
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.590
David Schaich (he): and actually this same

374
00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:01.260
David Schaich (he): relation holds for compression

375
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.620
David Schaich (he): t one at volume one.

376
00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:06.940
David Schaich (he): so that takes the place of

377
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:08.520
David Schaich (he): 2, 4.

378
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:17.740
David Schaich (he): It's that same. which is one over the compression ratio that we do

379
00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.270
that is defined in the activity.

380
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:22.190
David Schaich (he): So

381
00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:25.800
David Schaich (he): yeah, focus back

382
00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:36.730
David Schaich (he): from these sets of inequalities we can see 2 interesting things that T. 4 over 2, 3 is just given by the

383
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:41.300
David Schaich (he): compression ratio. but to roll it over to you for

384
00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:44.840
David Schaich (he): t one to that side.

385
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:49.050
David Schaich (he): 2, 4

386
00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.020
David Schaich (he): is the same as t 2

387
00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.840
David Schaich (he): over to you 3.

388
00:36:56.890 --> 00:37:09.120
David Schaich (he): So those 2 ratios are the same. Those 2 packers and parentheses cancel out. The efficiency is one that minus

389
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:12.510
David Schaich (he): t 4 over t 3, which is.

390
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:18.090
David Schaich (he): you know, minus one of the compression ratio, the 2 first power, and also

391
00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:22.960
David Schaich (he): the same as one minus t one over t 2.

392
00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:37.690
David Schaich (he): It was a. Into the activity itself. With the cargo efficiency it can be caused one minus the ratio of the hot and cold.

393
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.860
David Schaich (he): There's a more temperature.

394
00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:47.970
David Schaich (he): It's on top to keep the efficiency in the range 0 to one.

395
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.280
David Schaich (he): so he's the the Cardinal

396
00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:54.490
David Schaich (he): in this cell

397
00:37:54.610 --> 00:38:00.200
David Schaich (he): the cold temperature is it like one. A hot temperature is right after burning the fuel.

398
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:01.590
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Point, 3

399
00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:09.660
David Schaich (he): at high temperature is at t 3 is higher than t 2

400
00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:20.090
David Schaich (he): fairly obvious. If we think about what happens when we like the fuel that temperature increases. So the ratio is going to be smaller.

401
00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.680
So we are subtracting.

402
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:30.880
David Schaich (he): It's smaller. That will be so. We get the left over. That is bigger. then one minus

403
00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:37.040
David Schaich (he): with the auto cycle, so

404
00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:42.310
David Schaich (he): as expected. Part of it is more efficient than the auto cycle

405
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:55.600
David Schaich (he): banished from the other cycle of being that I can. We can run it thousands of times per minute.

406
00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.480
several hours to

407
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:59.430
David Schaich (he): once

408
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:05.460
David Schaich (he): iteration around the Carnot cycle if it's processes.

409
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.450
David Schaich (he): So

410
00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:16.420
David Schaich (he): I'm running out of time to say all the things that are to say about cycles.

411
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:19.070
David Schaich (he): What is that

412
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:26.240
David Schaich (he): to approve the efficiency with this Ada closer to 100%.

413
00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:33.470
David Schaich (he): You want that are to be as large as possible to reduce the you about this being subtracted.

414
00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:40.960
David Schaich (he): due to the amount of left over heats that is left in the exhaust rather than doing work in the power stage.

415
00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.220
David Schaich (he): So

416
00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:48.030
David Schaich (he): the maximization of that data is

417
00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.590
David Schaich (he): the largest possible ratio.

418
00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.650
David Schaich (he): The 2 volumes in the model cycle.

419
00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.660
David Schaich (he): So realistic values for this ratio

420
00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.800
David Schaich (he): around a few.

421
00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:19.150
David Schaich (he): The corresponding entropy is sorry about the efficiency

422
00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:29.230
David Schaich (he): is around 20 to 30% for petrol engines. and that is because there's a limit in practice on how large the

423
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:37.650
David Schaich (he): compression ratio can be made. Yeah limit is coming from the back there. As that compression stage receives

424
00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:42.900
David Schaich (he): the pressure and the temperature of this volatile mixture of

425
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.940
David Schaich (he): becoming more and more squeezed at the higher higher temperature.

426
00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:52.990
David Schaich (he): and that temperature rises too much in the

427
00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.590
David Schaich (he): compression stage.

428
00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.550
David Schaich (he): Sure. the compression ratio that's too large.

429
00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.190
David Schaich (he): Make sure it will typically spontaneously from us

430
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.750
David Schaich (he): all the way nights. Actually, before you get to

431
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:15.890
David Schaich (he): how you do

432
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.870
David Schaich (he): point where we want it to acknowledge what happens.

433
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:24.860
David Schaich (he): It's sort of yeah, we tried to make this be one and 2 is

434
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:29.170
David Schaich (he): far apart as possible. but as we do all of that compression.

435
00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:33.330
David Schaich (he): there will be spontaneously the spark coming in

436
00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.000
David Schaich (he): that makes the system at

437
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:40.660
David Schaich (he): some kicks it up

438
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:43.370
David Schaich (he): partway of the power stage

439
00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:46.870
David Schaich (he): where it's not able to get as much power out of

440
00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.480
David Schaich (he): spit out more heats and entropy in the exhaust

441
00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.980
David Schaich (he): which is no

442
00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.110
David Schaich (he): relative to chemical engineering. As a

443
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:02.960
David Schaich (he): i'm, not to the engine premature

444
00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.830
David Schaich (he): admission of the fuel. The disruption

445
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:11.910
David Schaich (he): rhythm with which you want the engine to be taking over.

446
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:17.020
David Schaich (he): So back, more than a 100 years ago.

447
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:24.380
David Schaich (he): rural Diesel, who tried to address this issue bye.

448
00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:27.930
David Schaich (he): let me up with a way to

449
00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.240
David Schaich (he): compressed gases

450
00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:35.590
David Schaich (he): over as large a ratio as possible without recognition.

451
00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:43.080
David Schaich (he): This solution was to compress from the air itself. which

452
00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:55.040
David Schaich (he): can burn, but only get to very high temperatures. The air does not spontaneously. and then.

453
00:42:55.590 --> 00:43:00.550
David Schaich (he): once that compression is done and the a. Is a high pressure and temperature.

454
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:06.370
David Schaich (he): Liquid fuel. Would that be injected?

455
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:10.520
David Schaich (he): It would immediately invite and drive it

456
00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:21.160
David Schaich (he): the engine. So this is the thermodynamic cycle that corresponds to a Diesel engine as opposed to a petrol engine.

457
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:29.460
David Schaich (he): So the compression again goes from the

458
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:38.840
David Schaich (he): There's only here in the system. At that stage

459
00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:50.600
David Schaich (he): fuel is injected. High temperature, high pressure. That was the injection stage which

460
00:43:53.810 --> 00:44:07.020
David Schaich (he): there is a constant force left on the system lingering phone. That compression. So the injection occurs as also pressure due to that constant force.

461
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:10.670
David Schaich (he): Then we get the usual power. and

462
00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:17.310
David Schaich (he): usually the exhaust of the burn fuel. You get back to the starting point with a fresh match up there

463
00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:19.020
David Schaich (he): that comes in again.

464
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:26.080
David Schaich (he): power and compression stage being in the

465
00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:40.390
David Schaich (he): so do you. Efficiency or the Diesel cycle is a function both of the compression ratio will be one over V. 2, as well as what it's called.

466
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:54.580
David Schaich (he): cut off ratio. 3 over V. 2, which governance, how long would it be injection and admission. It lasts before the compression of force is turned off

467
00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:56.390
David Schaich (he): can be

468
00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:09.680
David Schaich (he): extracted without us, or adiabatically. and running out of time. So i'll be it for homework assignments. You will compute that efficiency and see how it compares

469
00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:10.400
David Schaich (he): to

470
00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.490
take any questions before

471
00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:20.610
David Schaich (he): setting this aside. Given that it will be on that homework.

472
00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:42.360
Yeah.

473
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:46.750
David Schaich (he): that is done to keep it as similar as possible to

474
00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:59.720
David Schaich (he): the auto cycle. so of the largest and smallest. And then we after him, too. So the relative sizes of the volume.

475
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:13.260
David Schaich (he): Okay. But the system starting with fresh air. one compress the 2. I injected 3, and then follow that to them.

476
00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.320
David Schaich (he): So it's labeled By

477
00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:19.310
the time.

478
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:20.240
David Schaich (he): I think

479
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:31.240
David Schaich (he): pension goes through the cycle rather than the size it goes to, because going back and forth from one to 2 to 3. But yeah, that is a the observation.

480
00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:34.960
David Schaich (he): Okay.

481
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:42.320
David Schaich (he): we did in the cardo cycle, you know. We started the phone system in from the

482
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.120
David Schaich (he): with the engine

483
00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:55.570
David Schaich (he): kind of a natural place to start is right where the Yes, it's being compressed. Interest in the system. That's the difference with carnival that we are actually solving out one set of particles

484
00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:58.820
rather than looking cool.

485
00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:09.740
David Schaich (he): Just put them through the tail pipe and not worry about. Oh, unless we're breathing it on the outside. But that one is where we have a fresh.

486
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:14.400
David Schaich (he): that you either air or that mixture of air, and

487
00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:21.870
David Schaich (he): that we then work out, to press, burn, and extract our

488
00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.610
David Schaich (he): turn the wheels in that order. So that's the motivation for

489
00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:29.790
David Schaich (he): Well, the labeling is

490
00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:34.720
David Schaich (he): independent of the efficiency. You can label it as you see fit.

491
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.510
David Schaich (he): That's the justification for it.

492
00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.320
David Schaich (he): and we are out of time to.

493
00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.750
If you do anything with

494
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:45.540
David Schaich (he): yeah

495
00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:50.170
David Schaich (he): next activity, you can at least take a look at over the break.

496
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:54.080
David Schaich (he): I will up back to canvas, and

497
00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:09.800
David Schaich (he): from the modules page I think I put it under the quantum gases that we just started looking at on Tuesday, even though there's not

498
00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:19.340
David Schaich (he): anything to quantum about it, especially at the initial stage. And what we talked about how negative temperatures are unnatural.

499
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:21.660
David Schaich (he): I from spin systems.

500
00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:27.080
David Schaich (he): and if we recall well, if you have a good memory, this

501
00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:31.500
David Schaich (he): thought might look familiar because I showed it on the first day of class as a target that was

502
00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:32.630
to get to

503
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:35.540
David Schaich (he): predicting the

504
00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:42.430
David Schaich (he): black curves that provide a decent description of experimental measurements of the heat capacities

505
00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:44.120
David Schaich (he): of various solids.

506
00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:49.620
David Schaich (he): Back when we were working with distinguishable spins

507
00:48:50.380 --> 00:49:02.600
David Schaich (he): and looking at their information content, we said that if we had a solid, made up of spins. That is a way to distinguish them. They have a fixed position in the solid. We computed the

508
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:06.640
David Schaich (he): internal energy for a system of distinguishable spins

509
00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:18.580
David Schaich (he): that is given by the hyperbolic tangent function of the external magnetic field divided by the temperature. And the question is. first question.

510
00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.960
David Schaich (he): How well does our spin system results

511
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:27.910
David Schaich (he): reproduce the experimental data points, those black dots

512
00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:30.560
David Schaich (he): in this activity.

513
00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:44.240
David Schaich (he): So no time left for you to work on that here can be something to keep you entertained. But we don't have a class for the next few weeks. and I will give you a

514
00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.200
David Schaich (he): forecast that

515
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:52.650
David Schaich (he): the behavior turns out to be bad. And then there is a

516
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:56.660
David Schaich (he): someone smarter approach developed by Einstein

517
00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:01.200
David Schaich (he): shortly after his miracle year in 1,905, which, instead of having just

518
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:04.630
David Schaich (he): up and down spins forming the solid.

519
00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:15.200
David Schaich (he): Imagine that it consists of that are held in place by talking to all of their neighboring with some springs.

520
00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:22.740
David Schaich (he): or more generally, oscillators that carry the energy of the interactions between those atoms.

521
00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:29.370
David Schaich (he): So just model modeling the amount of energy in each of these springs

522
00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:32.890
David Schaich (he): as it quantized value either 0,

523
00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:44.700
David Schaich (he): H. Bar times the characteristic frequency or any integer positive integer multiple of that characters in frequency. 2 Hr. Omega, 3 H. Bar Omega, so on.

524
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.690
David Schaich (he): I can get to something

525
00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:50.230
David Schaich (he): that is in a bit better. Agreements

526
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:58.000
David Schaich (he): with experiment. with some lingering discrepancies, especially at low temperatures. which

527
00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:05.120
David Schaich (he): can only be resolved by accounting for the quantum nature

528
00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:16.450
David Schaich (he): of the particles, which is why that's filed under the quantum gases, and not something that we will get to until after that break. So run over time for the recording. Now.

529
00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:28.830
David Schaich (he): Sorry not to leave you any time to play with the that heat capacity in the lecture. But hopefully, yeah, that's something you can enjoy during the term Rick last call for

530
00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:32.790
David Schaich (he): final questions before shutting down

531
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.700
David Schaich (he): that we all intense to.
