00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.900
David Schaich (he): All right, we'll

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.690
David Schaich (he): get things under way, just briefly.

3
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.670
David Schaich (he): Using

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.460
David Schaich (he): Google Colab as a

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.400
David Schaich (he): hack to put the

6
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.460
David Schaich (he): attendance code for today up on the screen.

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.950
David Schaich (he): It is

8
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.650
David Schaich (he): 7 2 4 1 1 4.

9
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:49.190
David Schaich (he): So, there that is. And we've talked through all of the topics in the computer project,

10
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.120
David Schaich (he): so this is just a chance to push toward wrapping it up before

11
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.920
David Schaich (he): today's deadline --- and to ask any questions while

12
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.790
David Schaich (he): we're all here, either in person or remotely. I'll take a pass around to see

13
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.550
David Schaich (he): how you're doing to get started. But before I pause the recording to do that, just one call for

14
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.590
David Schaich (he): any general questions.

15
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.300
David Schaich (he): I did get an email asking about the best ways to

16
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.570
David Schaich (he): upload the answers in addition to the code and put some ideas for that onto the Discussion Board

17
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.920
David Schaich (he): on canvas. So short. Answer is.

18
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.670
David Schaich (he): whatever works for you to produce. A file to upload will work for me as well.

19
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.000
David Schaich (he): So, as I was

20
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.200
David Schaich (he): saying, just a bit ago, I'll be heading off to my office hours. Now I think

21
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.270
David Schaich (he): this room remains empty. If you want to stay here. i'm just going to

22
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.640
David Schaich (he): make this the shortest recording I've ever done in case one

23
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.860
David Schaich (he): needs to look up that attendance code later in today. So

24
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.570
David Schaich (he): good luck wrapping things up with that project and then moving on to the homework for the coming week.
