1
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.520
David Schaich (he): Okay, we can get going. We'll see if

2
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.020
David Schaich (he): more folks come in, either in the room or

3
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.430
David Schaich (he): remotely.

4
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.610
David Schaich (he): We are

5
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.870
David Schaich (he): in the last month of the module.

6
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.930
David Schaich (he): The 6-digit code for this afternoon

7
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.010
David Schaich (he): is 2, 3, 4, 9, 7, 0

8
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.840
David Schaich (he): It may well be, in addition to the nice weather at the moment, that folks are working hard to

9
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.940
David Schaich (he): wrap up the final homework assignment, due

10
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.170
David Schaich (he): tomorrow. Are there any

11
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.080
David Schaich (he): questions about that assignment, or what we did

12
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.330
David Schaich (he): in previous weeks before we get underway today?

13
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.300
David Schaich (he): Not seeing it either

14
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.590
David Schaich (he): go along with hopefully answering today the question that's up here, how we

15
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.770
David Schaich (he): distinguish the phase transitions that we talked about last week.

16
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.910
David Schaich (he): It's just different behaviors that we're seeing in non interacting system systems. We

17
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.130
David Schaich (he): motivated the introduction of interacting the theories by saying that they are

18
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:46.270
David Schaich (he): required to describe this way more complicated behavior. Which is it clear that there is something going on with the true phase transition that distinguishes this from

19
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.030
David Schaich (he): the different behavior we can see

20
00:01:49.110 --> 00:02:01.570
David Schaich (he): just for not a tracking system we've considered previously and more work with on your own in that homework assignment. So

21
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.240
David Schaich (he): to build up to this question. Let's just recall

22
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.220
David Schaich (he): easy model to call because it was discovered by it, is. Define in terms of

23
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.540
David Schaich (he): the same

24
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.520
David Schaich (he): now specifically located. how long

25
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.060
David Schaich (he): it will take to the you with lattice. For simplicity.

26
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:53.810
David Schaich (he): This easy model is defined by the energy for the microstates corresponding to you. Certain configuration of this.

27
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.360
David Schaich (he): you know

28
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.520
David Schaich (he): 2 terms contributing to the energy first to be

29
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.050
David Schaich (he): multiplication, of 2 spins on nearest neighboring sites. and then

30
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.980
David Schaich (he): the usual coupling of those spins to the external magnetic field.

31
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:25.960
David Schaich (he): So this matter, some we're used to is let me go over the and the sites in this lattice. and then this first sum is between nearest neighbor pairs which we can go into

32
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.750
David Schaich (he): these times and links between the insights in

33
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.300
David Schaich (he): the dimensions

34
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.270
David Schaich (he): and it you've seen it, even though

35
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.090
David Schaich (he): this model looks simple to

36
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:56.100
David Schaich (he): right now in terms of the latest structure of the order sheet. There is no known way to solve it analytically. You know. any more than on that

37
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.910
David Schaich (he): 2 dimensions. It's my exception in the case of the

38
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.520
David Schaich (he): I'll get to, maybe actually in court, if not

39
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.600
the lecture.

40
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.440
David Schaich (he): So the absence of an external solution. We

41
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.530
David Schaich (he): to do the usual approach, which is also

42
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.970
David Schaich (he): popping up in that over question. One is

43
00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.600
David Schaich (he): looking at the

44
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.810
David Schaich (he): simplified

45
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.980
David Schaich (he): behavior that

46
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:37.540
David Schaich (he): we can deduce in the limits of high temperature with the system. Yeah.

47
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.870
David Schaich (he): with some further simplicity for looking at these limits. Yes. go ahead. And

48
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.470
David Schaich (he): for all that.

49
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.490
David Schaich (he): each to 0. The energy is then

50
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.390
David Schaich (he): just the interaction

51
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.080
David Schaich (he): and the

52
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.530
David Schaich (he): I just call there

53
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.780
David Schaich (he): function depends

54
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.470
David Schaich (he): only on the inverse temperature, Bayl and the number. This is the cell

55
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.020
David Schaich (he): for all configurations

56
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.870
David Schaich (he): out, the end spins of

57
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.090
David Schaich (he): which is just data.

58
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.020
David Schaich (he): The repairs.

59
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.180
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

60
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.460
David Schaich (he): The high temperature limits the inverse temperature is going to 0,

61
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:48.680
David Schaich (he): which gives us a fairly simple form. Will the partition function? You have the similar configurations.

62
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.010
David Schaich (he): the exponential factor, a bigger going to 0 times.

63
00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:01.460
David Schaich (he): the sum of terms that are either plus or minus one, depending on whether these near state or spins are aligned in the same direction or opposite directions.

64
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:10.720
David Schaich (he): 0 times one is 0, so we are just getting a factor of one. It sounds number of state configurations. We can have

65
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.520
David Schaich (he): 2 values up or down, plus or minus one.

66
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:23.730
David Schaich (he): The efficient function as a whole in this type of visual limit just boils down to a factor of 2 to the end.

67
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.840
David Schaich (he): Yes.

68
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.000
David Schaich (he): that could be happening here, as we are

69
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.100
David Schaich (he): giving something that looks like the micro.

70
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.460
David Schaich (he): all of the microstates. Yeah.

71
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:53.630
David Schaich (he): Equal probabilities just one over 2 to the end, so that the total probability of being in any configuration still add up to one

72
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:07.520
David Schaich (he): and effectively, what's going on is that Yeah, of course not. The energy you couldn't see those microstates is kind of negligible

73
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.420
David Schaich (he): in the position function compared to

74
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.490
David Schaich (he): you. Temperature?

75
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.950
David Schaich (he): No.

76
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.080
David Schaich (he): even that.

77
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.490
David Schaich (he): The internal energy is

78
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.940
David Schaich (he): you coming in

79
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.570
to be negligible

80
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.940
David Schaich (he): and not

81
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:42.450
David Schaich (he): giving us anything interesting to pick apart in this limit. You, too. makes sense to look at other obserable quantities to characterize the system. This is.

82
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.300
David Schaich (he): let me introduce one that you have already seen all the whole work

83
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:53.830
David Schaich (he): to the

84
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.000
David Schaich (he): that organization

85
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.080
David Schaich (he): extent to which the spins

86
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:09.570
David Schaich (he): are all

87
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.380
David Schaich (he): my email or opposed to each other. So

88
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:27.300
David Schaich (he): as an equation. you just define this organization as the ratio of the number of spins with value, plus one minus the number of

89
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.410
minus one

90
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.530
David Schaich (he): divided by the total number of spins, the

91
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.460
David Schaich (he): some of the plus and minus ones.

92
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.120
David Schaich (he): It is hopefully here that.

93
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:45.900
David Schaich (he): bound on this mechanization are. It could be a minus one, and plus one

94
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.330
David Schaich (he): minus one of the limit where

95
00:08:49.570 --> 00:09:00.730
David Schaich (he): every spins has a value of minus one, it's going to be the absence of the magnetic field, or to align with or against. So in my this is the capital, and

96
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.240
David Schaich (he): up and down the

97
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.870
David Schaich (he): you know, minus one factor and plus one. Similarly, when all the spins

98
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.120
David Schaich (he): pointing out.

99
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.540
David Schaich (he): and in fact, with H equals 0.

100
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.530
David Schaich (he): There's not really a

101
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:29.210
David Schaich (he): way to distinguish between us, and by this one there's no external magnetic field, or

102
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.670
David Schaich (he): it's the point

103
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.280
David Schaich (he): that

104
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.810
David Schaich (he): the symmetry actually can take that leaves the whole system unchanged

105
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.950
David Schaich (he): to actually be okay.

106
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.840
David Schaich (he): all of the

107
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.760
David Schaich (he): to you

108
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.940
David Schaich (he): go to minus plus one.

109
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.690
David Schaich (he): and with this symmetry

110
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.300
David Schaich (he): it makes more sense to

111
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.690
David Schaich (he): consider the absolute value of this manitization.

112
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.820
It is a

113
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.040
David Schaich (he): no meaning effectively to the overall negative sign that you can

114
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.680
David Schaich (he): choose freely by flipping all the spins.

115
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:37.080
David Schaich (he): the ranges between 0 and one one. When all the spins are aligned, either plus or minus one and 0, and they are equal numbers of

116
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:48.990
David Schaich (he): so getting back to the high temperature limit. you want to

117
00:10:50.160 --> 00:11:01.220
David Schaich (he): consider the expectation down there. the absolute value of this organization. the sum over all of the microstates.

118
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.350
David Schaich (he): Because of that probability.

119
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.710
David Schaich (he): You see that

120
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:17.180
David Schaich (he): for high temperatures we have

121
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.150
David Schaich (he): all my trustees equally probably

122
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.070
David Schaich (he): so. All that is going to determine the expectation value

123
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:41.840
David Schaich (he): is the number of microstates that we have for any given value of that organization. We just need to count.

124
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:49.500
David Schaich (he): The number of equally probable microstates depends on the

125
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.100
magnetization is determined by

126
00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:03.160
David Schaich (he): either the number of upper.

127
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.930
David Schaich (he): We know that any given value of the

128
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.000
David Schaich (he): we realized

129
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:18.690
David Schaich (he): alright, and put in. Choose, and plus i'll be you.

130
00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:26.820
David Schaich (he): A number of microstates is equal to. and she's a long as usual. competition

131
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.630
David Schaich (he): here

132
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.270
David Schaich (he): seen before.

133
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.230
David Schaich (he): We have looked at

134
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.900
David Schaich (he): just this counting problem in some detail back in my earliest

135
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.400
David Schaich (he): tutorials have to be a computer Lab.

136
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.210
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

137
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:55.430
David Schaich (he): Computed the number of microstates, with various distributions of energy between 2 systems that had to add up to

138
00:12:55.530 --> 00:13:00.960
David Schaich (he): a fixed micro canonical value. Of that What we found

139
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.600
David Schaich (he): under a large number of degrees of freedom.

140
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:12.270
David Schaich (he): Bye. I don't know. completely dominated

141
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.390
David Schaich (he): a sharp peak in the number of

142
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.790
microstates.

143
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:18.360
David Schaich (he): Well.

144
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.210
David Schaich (he): the degrees of Freedom world equally yeah.

145
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.810
David Schaich (he): divided between the 2 sides in this case that corresponds to an equal number of

146
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.420
David Schaich (he): plus and minus spins.

147
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.160
David Schaich (he): which is just the situation where

148
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:41.160
David Schaich (he): we have a vanishing

149
00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:51.350
David Schaich (he): Yeah. so called thermodynamic minutes. There

150
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.860
David Schaich (he): number of goes to infinity.

151
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.880
David Schaich (he): expectation, value as a whole. no approach

152
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:06.780
David Schaich (he): that

153
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.570
David Schaich (he): 0 result.

154
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.470
David Schaich (he): There are so many microstates with an equal number upward in the

155
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.590
my skins.

156
00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.900
David Schaich (he): that even with the absolute value we don't pick up a

157
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.850
David Schaich (he): even with the

158
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.130
David Schaich (he): you have it

159
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:39.390
David Schaich (he): random sampling of equally probable microstates. I wish

160
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:45.840
David Schaich (he): a dominant number will have upward and downloading spins all scattered throughout the system.

161
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.450
David Schaich (he): There are

162
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.820
David Schaich (he): state configurations realizing that sort of physics

163
00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.930
David Schaich (he): which gives rise to the

164
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.170
David Schaich (he): standard.

165
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:09.050
David Schaich (he): This high temperature situation is a disorder phase. It's a collection of offered and downloading spins

166
00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:09.850
David Schaich (he): all

167
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.110
David Schaich (he): you can chose in the No pattern or

168
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.490
David Schaich (he): throughout the labs.

169
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:30.710
David Schaich (he): So hopefully that picture of this one in phase is

170
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.620
David Schaich (he): reasonably fear. It might become clear as we

171
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.450
David Schaich (he): part of the low temperature.

172
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.260
David Schaich (he): good and

173
00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.070
David Schaich (he): and cross the behavior of the organization

174
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.470
David Schaich (he): there. Of course, as always.

175
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.110
David Schaich (he): we got it. Things i'm here.

176
00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.230
David Schaich (he): anyway.

177
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.890
David Schaich (he): So

178
00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.420
David Schaich (he): going on.

179
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:04.570
David Schaich (he): it's a real temperature. Where is going to infinity?

180
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.540
David Schaich (he): Again, the situation is.

181
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.170
David Schaich (he): it's been system we've already dealt with

182
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.480
David Schaich (he): in the sense that the

183
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.000
David Schaich (he): ground states the microstates with

184
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.400
David Schaich (he): of the energy

185
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.580
David Schaich (he): It comes exponentially

186
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.020
David Schaich (he): your probable, then.

187
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.380
David Schaich (he): and you have the excitement states with higher energy levels.

188
00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.230
David Schaich (he): energies. You know.

189
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:51.660
David Schaich (he): most of the internal energy of the microstate. As we a goes to infinity, we can exponential suppression

190
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.670
David Schaich (he): as the interval energy increases.

191
00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.890
David Schaich (he): And this the external magnetic field turned off. Yeah.

192
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.730
David Schaich (he): microstate soil

193
00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:13.990
David Schaich (he): well, not rare. All of the students.

194
00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:21.060
David Schaich (he): and the value plus one which we could think of as pointing out number of.

195
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.380
David Schaich (he): and the the first case in which all the spins

196
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.820
David Schaich (he): one.

197
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:39.620
David Schaich (he): And you should. Those cases you have to takes its maximum value. Oh, well.

198
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.040
David Schaich (he): and you can easily compute

199
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.270
David Schaich (he): the ground, State energy.

200
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.170
David Schaich (he): It's the sum over

201
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:58.540
David Schaich (he): links to the latest of the value of the spins. All the sites at each end of those links.

202
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:07.970
David Schaich (he): In both of these cases these spins have the same value. I plus one. Yeah. with minus one

203
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.710
David Schaich (he): we are multiply together.

204
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.680
David Schaich (he): and the plus and minus one square to get. So we just count the number of terms in the cell.

205
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.890
David Schaich (he): It is the total number.

206
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.880
David Schaich (he): negative, one energy, contribution.

207
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.390
David Schaich (he): From every one of these

208
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.310
the

209
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.350
David Schaich (he): the dimensions.

210
00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.470
David Schaich (he): It would be

211
00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.670
David Schaich (he): first excited energy level.

212
00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:54.090
David Schaich (he): We want to figure out the value of the energy that is

213
00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:04.420
David Schaich (he): as low as possible without being all the way to this. To you all this change we can make to the system. To

214
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.670
David Schaich (he): obtain, that is, to flip a single link

215
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:11.550
David Schaich (he): with a single spin

216
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.850
David Schaich (he): understand affects all of these

217
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.370
David Schaich (he): it is attached to. I will say

218
00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:33.150
David Schaich (he): we're working in more than one dimension. The one dimensional cases. a special case how we can. I don't have to

219
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.660
David Schaich (he): so

220
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.760
David Schaich (he): microstates that

221
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.950
David Schaich (he): correspond to this first excited energy level. We'll have.

222
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:47.130
David Schaich (he): I got it?

223
00:19:51.940 --> 00:20:01.780
David Schaich (he): What? The opposite? In each case there are. and possible spins that we could flip to the opposite all the Us.

224
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.430
David Schaich (he): Together. the count

225
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.870
David Schaich (he): 2 and generate microstates

226
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.940
David Schaich (he): that realize this energy level

227
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:19.550
David Schaich (he): and

228
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:26.630
David Schaich (he): all of them. You'll have the value of an organization that

229
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.320
David Schaich (he): is going back to the definition. The difference in the awesome time with spins

230
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:36.610
David Schaich (he): so.

231
00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.730
David Schaich (he): and minus one minus one is n minus 2,

232
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.420
and there are still.

233
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:51.010
David Schaich (he): So we have. That is close to the maximum that we get in the ground state

234
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:57.030
David Schaich (he): with just a a slight reduction from that

235
00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.850
David Schaich (he): maximum depending on the

236
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.550
David Schaich (he): little number of space.

237
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:17.720
David Schaich (he): The question is, what is the overall mechanization going to look like on the account for

238
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:29.420
David Schaich (he): these lowlying energy levels of the course of the probabilities. If you get the our ability to the energy levels, we you to consider the

239
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.470
David Schaich (he): internal energy

240
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:33.930
so

241
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:38.290
David Schaich (he): probabilities.

242
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:42.850
David Schaich (he): It depends

243
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.230
David Schaich (he): on the Internal Energy Board.

244
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.010
David Schaich (he): This first excited state.

245
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:59.620
David Schaich (he): which we can essentially right down the how, how things works. what the ground state

246
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:05.960
David Schaich (he): for all of the links. We are. The 2 values of the spins

247
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:10.810
David Schaich (he): are the same. You pick up a minus one contribution to the energy.

248
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.790
David Schaich (he): and then we will have

249
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.940
David Schaich (he): too many links attached to this.

250
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.800
David Schaich (he): which we all

251
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.650
David Schaich (he): on the 2 ends of those lays.

252
00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.480
David Schaich (he): to be. thanks to the possible contribution to the energy.

253
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.430
David Schaich (he): all the people here. students.

254
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:43.220
David Schaich (he): or do you have that same minus one factor that we had before?

255
00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.310
David Schaich (he): So we arranging? This is

256
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.100
David Schaich (he): minus D. And

257
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.690
David Schaich (he): I was 4 deal.

258
00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:03.850
David Schaich (he): and. as expected. Not quite as negative. Is that minimum energy. We're on stage.

259
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.760
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

260
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.810
David Schaich (he): Reflection of your possible contribution

261
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.810
David Schaich (he): in those 2 video links.

262
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.810
David Schaich (he): minus one.

263
00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.360
David Schaich (he): the other

264
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:43.160
David Schaich (he): that are unaffected, going from the ground State to the first excited state.

265
00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.610
David Schaich (he): And did you get that back on the screen?

266
00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:06.690
David Schaich (he): So there are 2 of picks I'm. Again to determine how the ground State and the first excited state are

267
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:11.220
David Schaich (he): contributing to the overall expectation

268
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.640
David Schaich (he): magnetization.

269
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.830
David Schaich (he): Probably the first excited states we have

270
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.610
David Schaich (he): for each of the microstates with this energy

271
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.720
David Schaich (he): from the

272
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.580
David Schaich (he): but at the same time

273
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.410
David Schaich (he): we have the however

274
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.640
David Schaich (he): degeneracy so.

275
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:47.370
David Schaich (he): and that is you ever at microstates. Yeah. at first excited stage compared to the

276
00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.850
David Schaich (he): you generate ground States with the minimum energy she was in.

277
00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.540
David Schaich (he): They're all they're infinitely more

278
00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.430
David Schaich (he): excited States.

279
00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:06.640
David Schaich (he): each of them, with their little probability. And the question is. which of those 2?

280
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:15.010
David Schaich (he): The facts will win out in your role, Expectation value

281
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:21.120
David Schaich (he): 2? 2. Answer that question. Okay. The

282
00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.600
David Schaich (he): the system in

283
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.390
David Schaich (he): it's crowd states any of the general microstates that are

284
00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:39.420
David Schaich (he): part of that ground states compared to having the system in the first

285
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:46.180
David Schaich (he): out of you. You ever see 2 for the ground state to end

286
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:54.310
David Schaich (he): for the first excited state and the yes, we factor e to the minus beta Times energy

287
00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:56.010
I have

288
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:57.890
David Schaich (he): just computed to be

289
00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.330
David Schaich (he): my this. the

290
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.490
the ground states.

291
00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:04.640
David Schaich (he): and

292
00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:18.290
David Schaich (he): these exponential factors. the to the end. She only has to

293
00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:19.670
yeah

294
00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:27.990
David Schaich (he): overall factors of the partition functions in. That's what we define normalized probabilities. And then

295
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.570
David Schaich (he): a factor of one over and over

296
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.640
David Schaich (he): to the numerator

297
00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:48.000
David Schaich (he): reversing it. So in temperature going to 0,

298
00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.180
David Schaich (he): your to infinity. You will

299
00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.480
David Schaich (he): approach. hey?

300
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:10.990
David Schaich (he): Very large relative probability for the ground state so effectively. domination only by the kernel state, despite the larger number of microstates contributing

301
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.760
David Schaich (he): to the first excited States.

302
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:16.780
David Schaich (he): and

303
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:24.370
David Schaich (he): the corresponding value of the organization will therefore approach its ground state value with one. All of the skills.

304
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:28.660
David Schaich (he): Hello! Which this is we.

305
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.250
David Schaich (he): We'll call this an order phase

306
00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:40.510
David Schaich (he): that is realized. Yes. low temperatures.

307
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.320
David Schaich (he): And this might seem

308
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.400
David Schaich (he): obvious, because it is

309
00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:51.480
David Schaich (he): similar to what we saw earlier in the case. So I will point out that this argument

310
00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:52.610
David Schaich (he): it was

311
00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.210
David Schaich (he): not.

312
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:58.280
David Schaich (he): If we don't.

313
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:06.540
David Schaich (he): we do not actually ground state winning out and derivation on that, or something that

314
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:18.560
David Schaich (he): may wait for one of those supplemental andcasts that make up to you couple of hours of lecture that we're cancelled yesterday and next Monday for the night holidays.

315
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:23.720
David Schaich (he): So let me pause here and check to make sure that these 2

316
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.570
David Schaich (he): phases that I have defined at the high, low temperature limits are

317
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.590
David Schaich (he): there? Is everyone there's no questions about.

318
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.260
David Schaich (he): How are you

319
00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:41.880
David Schaich (he): deduce this behavior, or why we're looking at in the first place.

320
00:28:48.710 --> 00:29:02.090
David Schaich (he): and this these are the ingredients that we need to answer the question that it's probably just on the projector at the of the lecture today.

321
00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.800
David Schaich (he): What distinguishes these things just from the different behavior

322
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.830
that we were seeing already for knowledge reacting spin systems

323
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.640
David Schaich (he): based on

324
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.750
David Schaich (he): this behavior that we've seen, we can

325
00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:22.650
David Schaich (he): you find

326
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.610
David Schaich (he): if you general qualities

327
00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.150
David Schaich (he): motivated by the specific example.

328
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:31.550
David Schaich (he): i'll be using model

329
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:41.120
David Schaich (he): to the personally general concepts is that parameter

330
00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:52.420
David Schaich (he): something I may just call okay for shorts. We are in the using model of the magnetization that we've been considering is

331
00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.900
David Schaich (he): the specific realization of

332
00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.350
David Schaich (he): it was a parameter. What this

333
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:05.240
David Schaich (he): distinguish

334
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:11.360
David Schaich (he): a disorder phase where the parameter goes to 0,

335
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:13.880
David Schaich (he): which

336
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.050
David Schaich (he): in the

337
00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:21.870
these. the high temperature

338
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:27.000
David Schaich (he): that gets distinguished from the you.

339
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.940
David Schaich (he): What are things with the

340
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:36.010
David Schaich (he): We are here as a non 0 expectation value

341
00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:43.920
David Schaich (he): what it using model as an organization approaching one. It's absolutely

342
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:45.980
the real temperature regime.

343
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:48.160
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

344
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:52.360
David Schaich (he): the general statement about interacting statistical systems.

345
00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:00.170
David Schaich (he): Whether the expectation value for this order parameter

346
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:03.740
David Schaich (he): 0, we're 9 0

347
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:08.560
David Schaich (he): specifically in Yes.

348
00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:15.270
David Schaich (he): it's an infinite number of degrees of freedom

349
00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.220
David Schaich (he): is what fully distinguishes

350
00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:25.780
David Schaich (he): different phases of the theory.

351
00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:30.860
David Schaich (he): We'll be home just the different behavior that we saw

352
00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.830
David Schaich (he): in the case of knowledge.

353
00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.760
David Schaich (he): and there's even more that can be said on the basis of

354
00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.990
David Schaich (he): these order parameters

355
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:53.010
David Schaich (he): that address the question of precisely how the order of parameter changes from being 0 in

356
00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:57.680
David Schaich (he): the order of the disorder phase to being non-zero in the order phase.

357
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:13.300
David Schaich (he): So this actually provides us the mathematical definition. obviously a transition which is that if the order parameter or any of its derivatives

358
00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:18.490
David Schaich (he): all right.

359
00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:24.230
David Schaich (he): discontinuous. including.

360
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.060
David Schaich (he): Then

361
00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:37.720
David Schaich (he): there is a true phase transition

362
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.220
David Schaich (he): separating those 2 phases.

363
00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.640
the control parameters.

364
00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:51.990
David Schaich (he): No, it has

365
00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:55.810
David Schaich (he): critical point.

366
00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:06.770
David Schaich (he): and it was a clarify.

367
00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:13.090
David Schaich (he): Why this matters in the case, that the there are no discontinuities in the order parameter, or

368
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.820
David Schaich (he): any of its derivatives.

369
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:29.300
David Schaich (he): instead of having a phase. Transition is the gradual shift between them. There's 2 different types of behavior. Let me see you in non interacting systems.

370
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.800
David Schaich (he): and this is

371
00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:42.550
David Schaich (he): is characterized by being continuous and differentiable in contrast to

372
00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.880
behavior of

373
00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.650
David Schaich (he): the true transition.

374
00:33:52.170 --> 00:34:08.380
David Schaich (he): So this is essentially the answer to that. I was supposed to start up today. What distinguishes the phase transition from just a system that has different behavior in different regimes

375
00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:15.860
David Schaich (he): of its order. Parameter is the behavior I would we're in there

376
00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:25.940
David Schaich (he): in the particular is the presence of a discontinuity, or the versions in that word parameter, or any of its derivatives.

377
00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:35.850
David Schaich (he): What do you using Mobile, just mentioned. related to

378
00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.670
David Schaich (he): 4 points that should have been the

379
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.340
David Schaich (he): with H. Equals 0 and the easy model

380
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:55.510
David Schaich (he): critical points that

381
00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:01.260
David Schaich (he): we will be interested in. Assuming that you will see.

382
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:05.820
David Schaich (he): Discontinuity is in the

383
00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:17.220
David Schaich (he): No. Just be defined by the one control she is the I'm. Sure. Some will say that

384
00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:24.930
David Schaich (he): if there is a transition, it occurs and critical

385
00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.870
David Schaich (he): the temperature away from

386
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:34.920
David Schaich (he): that. The order parameter wants to exhibit this discount. New it

387
00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.890
David Schaich (he): bring in.

388
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:47.430
David Schaich (he): oh. or parameters.

389
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:49.760
David Schaich (he): Let me see that

390
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:56.090
David Schaich (he): only to be an order parameter equality

391
00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:57.830
it should be.

392
00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.500
David Schaich (he): We'll lead into

393
00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.550
David Schaich (he): some derivative of the free energy.

394
00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:07.540
David Schaich (he): It's a derivative of the

395
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:11.320
David Schaich (he): function which is just

396
00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.940
the partition function itself.

397
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.120
David Schaich (he): I think we'll. I have plenty of time to

398
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:28.600
David Schaich (he): see how the magnetization is related to the free energy for the using model.

399
00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:33.120
David Schaich (he): One last piece of terminology, before

400
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.820
David Schaich (he): which is a

401
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:43.650
David Schaich (he): distinction that is wrong.

402
00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:58.820
David Schaich (he): We will encounter it between different types of phase transitions depending on with it or not. The is discontinuous, or these discontinuities only arise

403
00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:03.380
David Schaich (he): in It's derivatives in the case when

404
00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:08.460
David Schaich (he): you know, working with a just continuous.

405
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.410
David Schaich (he): or a parameter itself. we have

406
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:16.620
David Schaich (he): it's called a first order. This transition.

407
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.140
David Schaich (he): where.

408
00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:27.820
David Schaich (he): in case of a continuous or the parameter with

409
00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:30.850
David Schaich (he): discontinuous.

410
00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:34.160
David Schaich (he): the version derivative

411
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:45.400
David Schaich (he): is in general calling

412
00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:52.070
David Schaich (he): the second order. This transition. both of which play

413
00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:00.230
David Schaich (he): many different aspect. So

414
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:11.330
David Schaich (he): physics, for example, the generation of gravitational waves in the early universe can result only from a first-order transition and walk in the second order one.

415
00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:16.260
David Schaich (he): many similar, less exotic examples.

416
00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:33.400
David Schaich (he): So just to give the picture, that is. we're distinguishing between them these 2, you order parameter against it's control parameters and specialized the case where we just have

417
00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:41.600
David Schaich (he): at the time that your region, we expect that to be in

418
00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:50.270
David Schaich (he): the ordered phase is the knowledge of the value of that word of parameter or something like that in the high temperature phase

419
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.500
David Schaich (he): you accept the

420
00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.990
David Schaich (he): limit of

421
00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.620
David Schaich (he): and going to infinity.

422
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.900
David Schaich (he): there is exactly 0.

423
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:09.250
David Schaich (he): And if there is yeah.

424
00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.870
David Schaich (he): pretty cool temperature. this is the

425
00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.790
David Schaich (he): first order case.

426
00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:33.040
David Schaich (he): Interesting case for second order transitions is where that

427
00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.800
David Schaich (he): not 0 value continuously

428
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:43.600
David Schaich (he): 0 expectation value. When we highlight your phase There he is

429
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:58.830
David Schaich (he): some sort of a that you take the derivative we will introduce. I think, in a versions or in this company away. So yeah.

430
00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:02.320
David Schaich (he): the rough derivative of

431
00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:10.050
David Schaich (he): just the I know one that's scheduled here

432
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:12.870
David Schaich (he): when no.

433
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:18.490
David Schaich (he): the order of parameter itself is 0, and the T. It's derivative is also 0

434
00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:23.330
David Schaich (he): and the low temperature phase. I started it.

435
00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:34.260
David Schaich (he): Growing things with the order prem or being roughly constant with T, and then it goes down to smaller values. So it's derivative

436
00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.440
David Schaich (he): less than 0 like so. And

437
00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.480
David Schaich (he): And here is really how

438
00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:45.390
David Schaich (he): I just want to do what you

439
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:50.070
David Schaich (he): at the value of Tc. I'll spend the order parameter itself

440
00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.840
David Schaich (he): There it is. You better fit with the projector.

441
00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:01.780
David Schaich (he): Historically, this first and second order. Terminology

442
00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:03.620
David Schaich (he): was related to

443
00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:07.130
David Schaich (he): whether the

444
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:13.880
David Schaich (he): first or second derivative of the free energy these days. It's more common to say that

445
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:18.660
David Schaich (he): any system with an order parameter that is continuous.

446
00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:28.680
David Schaich (he): I had a discontinuity in any subsequent, derivative no matter how many you have to take the second third. There are things 3 mail.

447
00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:37.130
David Schaich (he): all of those will just be referred to as second order, which is continuous. These transitions.

448
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:40.800
David Schaich (he): So

449
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:44.640
David Schaich (he): let's wrap up today by

450
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:50.680
David Schaich (he): nothing back to that what a parameter should be

451
00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.410
David Schaich (he): related to some derivative of the 3 energy.

452
00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:05.710
David Schaich (he): So, looking at the using model as I see this interactive statistical system. I want to relate the organization to

453
00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:18.380
David Schaich (he): some derivative of the help of it's free energy. So minus T. Let me see what is the partition function in order to do so.

454
00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:25.160
David Schaich (he): It's probably not surprising that Will I to the store.

455
00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:29.550
David Schaich (he): Yes.

456
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:33.300
David Schaich (he): gives this mechanization a preference to a line

457
00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.340
David Schaich (he): with magnetic field rather than against it.

458
00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:42.780
David Schaich (he): Energy of Microsoft. Yeah. Goes back to you.

459
00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:47.590
David Schaich (he): The full expression, the interact internal.

460
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:51.570
David Schaich (he): the contribution from a couple of the skins

461
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.970
David Schaich (he): to the external magnetic field.

462
00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.670
David Schaich (he): because the organization

463
00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:01.430
David Schaich (he): is just counting the

464
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:06.020
David Schaich (he): number of upward meeting spins with

465
00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:11.580
David Schaich (he): dot us n plus one minus the number of down the point experience

466
00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.670
minus one.

467
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:16.490
David Schaich (he): It should be

468
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:20.700
David Schaich (he): easy to convince ourselves that the mechanization itself

469
00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:26.540
David Schaich (he): it's just related to the sum over Sp. pretty good and plus

470
00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:32.260
David Schaich (he): positive contributions with this one, and then minus negative contributions with this

471
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:37.670
David Schaich (he): minus one. So the energy right

472
00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:49.770
David Schaich (he): as the times number of spins as an organization just

473
00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.670
David Schaich (he): in times.

474
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:58.040
David Schaich (he): So the corresponding

475
00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:02.210
David Schaich (he): precision function that we're interested in taking a derivative. Oh.

476
00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:05.240
David Schaich (he): we all. as usual, some

477
00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:11.770
David Schaich (he): State configurations. the exponential connector

478
00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:15.710
David Schaich (he): I want to.

479
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:19.910
David Schaich (he): Yes.

480
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:25.570
David Schaich (he): these 2 terms.

481
00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:28.970
David Schaich (he): and that

482
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:33.400
David Schaich (he): given that we're already seeing the magnetization

483
00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:44.640
David Schaich (he): I know they term. That depends on our additional control. People make sense to consider some

484
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:51.540
David Schaich (he): with respect to that. Yeah. see what we do.

485
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.600
David Schaich (he): So the energy is

486
00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:04.230
David Schaich (he): what over there is that the H.

487
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:07.570
David Schaich (he): And

488
00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:12.740
David Schaich (he): that derivative just goes straight through some of the configurations.

489
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:26.490
David Schaich (he): you know from the exponential factor in the each you bet on. and then and then we

490
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:29.720
David Schaich (he): exponential factor. so

491
00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.890
David Schaich (he): cancel out the

492
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:56.130
David Schaich (he): and recognize that what was that? I's the exponential of minus data times, the energy within the some of the configurations

493
00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:58.000
David Schaich (he): it's just giving us the

494
00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:01.560
David Schaich (he): expectation value of the organization

495
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:08.450
David Schaich (he): for each of those spin configurations. So overall I just get

496
00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:14.630
David Schaich (he): also factors of West Canada Expectation Bill.

497
00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.520
David Schaich (he): and

498
00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:32.960
David Schaich (he): there's an advertisement. The relation between organization itself and the derivative of the free energy or

499
00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.080
David Schaich (he): derivative of

500
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:48.670
David Schaich (he): where I just put things in the floor that will be useful

501
00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:57.120
David Schaich (he): calculations for next week or a week after

502
00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:02.080
David Schaich (he): right negative temperature as whatever data.

503
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:08.970
David Schaich (he): you can't see out the negative signs that come along with it in the free energy compared to the one of them.

504
00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:13.140
David Schaich (he): So this is

505
00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.250
David Schaich (he): for the confirmation that

506
00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.880
David Schaich (he): mechanization is

507
00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:26.040
David Schaich (he): satisfy all the conditions that it needs to be. A. We'll define order parameter.

508
00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:32.540
David Schaich (he): whose behavior and the behavior of its derivatives and indicate

509
00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:45.180
David Schaich (he): 2.2 software today and quickly. Not forget everything before we come back to this

510
00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.250
David Schaich (he): next week. It's not looking at other ways of

511
00:47:48.840 --> 00:48:04.270
David Schaich (he): analyzing the easy model without trying to so exactly so. We've see the day as the answer of this question, what distinguishes the true phase transition? I'll just change the behavior

512
00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:08.010
David Schaich (he): as a as a control or an area varies.

513
00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:12.240
David Schaich (he): The answer is the existence in this order parameter.

514
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:19.420
David Schaich (he): and this behavior you get here. This derivatives with respect to those control.

515
00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.540
David Schaich (he): See a concrete example of

516
00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:27.240
David Schaich (he): second order transitions in that

517
00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.320
David Schaich (he): our upcoming work on using model.

518
00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:36.850
David Schaich (he): Are there any questions before what you do this afternoon?

519
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:57.840
David Schaich (he): Shut down the recording. and and the remainder of this week is just another. How we're in the tutorial on Thursday morning. No finished talking about the Dubai theory of

520
00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:01.080
David Schaich (he): basic level, and then

521
00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:03.180
David Schaich (he): and a bit

522
00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:06.310
David Schaich (he): more interesting things that could happen with lattices

523
00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:09.700
David Schaich (he): and spin systems on them rather than just having this

524
00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:15.900
David Schaich (he): simple cubic setup in the dimensions you are. See, then.
