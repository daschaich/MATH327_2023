1
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.870
David Schaich (he): So, we can get going with the last afternoon lecture, though not the

2
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.120
David Schaich (he): last lecture overall.  We have that holiday replacement scheduled for next Monday morning,

3
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:31.090
David Schaich (he): to wrap things up once and for all.  Before we get to there, I have the 6-digit code for you this afternoon:

4
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.380
David Schaich (he): 31, 38, 34.

5
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.390
David Schaich (he): And I should also mention that in addition to

6
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.580
David Schaich (he): the rescheduled lecture for next Monday,

7
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:55.400
David Schaich (he): we've missed a full four hours of lectures due to bank holidays this year, so I've been asked to make up the other two hours just with some supplemental pencasts.  The

8
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.990
David Schaich (he): first of those is on Canvas, dealing with

9
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.950
David Schaich (he): relativistic fermion gases, and a couple more will

10
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.670
David Schaich (he): follow over the coming week.

11
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.890
David Schaich (he): So

12
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.270
David Schaich (he): are there any questions

13
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.010
David Schaich (he): from last time before we get under way with

14
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.420
David Schaich (he): further means of analyzing the Ising model this afternoon?

15
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.810
David Schaich (he): not seeing any of this recap.

16
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.850
David Schaich (he): Here we are at the

17
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.300
David Schaich (he): today and next Monday.

18
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.990
David Schaich (he): looking at the simplest possible

19
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.360
David Schaich (he): interacting and statistical system.

20
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.680
David Schaich (he): That is the using the

21
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.730
David Schaich (he): okay

22
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.480
David Schaich (he): 3 dimensional.

23
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.450
David Schaich (he): The energy of the system

24
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:07.050
David Schaich (he): is a combination of knowledge interactions between You're a city of repairs, of spins. That's true as can define by that by the structure.

25
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.170
David Schaich (he): Oh. each of the individual spins

26
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.120
David Schaich (he): to an external.

27
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.420
David Schaich (he): This is a

28
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:29.850
David Schaich (he): system that, despite its simplicity, it is not possible to solve analytically, that is, give a close form expression for this partition function in

29
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.890
David Schaich (he): more than 2 or fewer than infinite dimensions.

30
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.890
David Schaich (he): We've been doing it through

31
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.700
David Schaich (he): 3 ways of extracting information about the using model.

32
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.870
David Schaich (he): unfortunately spread out over 3 or 4 different weeks, just because we're going to be at one next year for a week. So the first of those

33
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.380
David Schaich (he): ways which we went through last time was the usual high in low temperature limits. We are.

34
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.770
David Schaich (he): the system simplifies. and the with those simplifications we were able to see. Yes.

35
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.980
David Schaich (he): magnetization of the system. expectation, value that.

36
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.280
David Schaich (he): and as usual, we are able to late to derivative

37
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.830
David Schaich (he): the

38
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.590
David Schaich (he): is a way of distinguishing between

39
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.120
David Schaich (he): the high temperature behavior.

40
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.660
David Schaich (he): It is an order parameter.

41
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.710
David Schaich (he): so call because

42
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.130
David Schaich (he): I am the temperature. Phases are characterized by the presence of

43
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.080
David Schaich (he): order. Among all these spins I can.

44
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.070
David Schaich (he): So the high temperature phase

45
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.320
David Schaich (he): using models just ordered

46
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.550
David Schaich (he): absolutely with the organization.

47
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.480
David Schaich (he): It is to 0 in the through dynamic limits of the number of degrees of freedom.

48
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:23.620
David Schaich (he): low temperature, phase, even the absence with an external introduce a preferred direction.

49
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:37.670
David Schaich (he): This magnetization pixel. the non-zero value that approaches it's maximum. introducing the absolute value. so that we don't have to distinguish between

50
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.640
David Schaich (he): out of the negative

51
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:57.110
David Schaich (he): and approaches that maximum as the temperature which is 0. What I forgot to do last week was awesome. visual. being, sort of distinguishing or remembering the distinctions between these.

52
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:04.160
David Schaich (he): I know temperature phases. So this is a collection of figures problem.

53
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.780
David Schaich (he): Vancouver is introduction to thermal business, which is one of the textbooks on the reading list. just taking it.

54
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.840
David Schaich (he): Individual snapshots of a 20 by 20, using model system as

55
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.580
David Schaich (he): several different temperatures.

56
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.170
David Schaich (he): We are

57
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.230
David Schaich (he): the black and white squares in these pictures are distinguishing between spins that

58
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.820
David Schaich (he): oh.

59
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:47.780
David Schaich (he): it was color, black and white view assigned to which orientation is completely up to you. But if you would get high temperatures in this 2

60
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.280
David Schaich (he): there is a roughly equal balance of up and down reporting spins

61
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.010
David Schaich (he): an organization

62
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.510
David Schaich (he): or these configurations

63
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.420
David Schaich (he): roughly 0,

64
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.530
David Schaich (he): and

65
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.080
David Schaich (he): essentially no way of distinguishing

66
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.390
David Schaich (he): these States from just randomly assigned

67
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.740
David Schaich (he): what values to the 400 spins

68
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.490
David Schaich (he): in each of these systems.

69
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.510
David Schaich (he): because the temperature decreases going down

70
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:29.450
David Schaich (he): 4, 3, and 2.5, and see the emergence of patches or their names.

71
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.160
David Schaich (he): These systems, with periodic boundary conditions.

72
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.200
David Schaich (he): wrap around from top to bottom. from left to right.

73
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.310
David Schaich (he): black and white watches

74
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.680
David Schaich (he): domains where all the spins are aligned, and eventually at the

75
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.110
David Schaich (he): very low temperatures. To

76
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.610
David Schaich (he): all of these things will the pointing in one direction or the other?

77
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.090
David Schaich (he): Okay.

78
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.130
David Schaich (he): the organization.

79
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:10.920
David Schaich (he): the t equals one case. Here is a little funny, just because temperature is so little. The system got stuck with this strike running across this.

80
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.390
David Schaich (he): Leave it

81
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.190
David Schaich (he): long enough running on the computer that generated these.

82
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.620
David Schaich (he): That's right. We'll eventually be, you know.

83
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.400
David Schaich (he): just one.

84
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.240
David Schaich (he): Here. It's relevant. To

85
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.930
David Schaich (he): Remember that with these 2520 lattice and something very large.

86
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:39.840
David Schaich (he): The number of things is like 2 to 400, which is. and to a very large number of.

87
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.320
David Schaich (he): I wonder.

88
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.980
David Schaich (he): as we go from that

89
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.930
David Schaich (he): the high temperature to a low temperature phases Here

90
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.020
David Schaich (he): there is some point where

91
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.200
David Schaich (he): change the word of parameters coming to you

92
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:06.690
David Schaich (he): convert from being 0, to being non-zero. and

93
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.600
David Schaich (he): yes, your is a

94
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.820
David Schaich (he): discounted you.

95
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.070
David Schaich (he): I'll stay with you for a moment.

96
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:16.920
Another picture at all.

97
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.420
David Schaich (he): This is a Sec.

98
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.030
David Schaich (he): In either the order, parameter. or any of its derivatives.

99
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.320
David Schaich (he): that you see

100
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:43.440
David Schaich (he): indication that this change is a true phase. Transition. as opposed to what is called a also

101
00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:47.730
David Schaich (he): and just a gradual change between different types of behavior

102
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.850
David Schaich (he): in the 2D easy model. I'll give you a bit of a support that there is a two-phase transition.

103
00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.750
David Schaich (he): and this is a much larger lattice generated by a computer taken at

104
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:02.890
David Schaich (he): that

105
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.340
David Schaich (he): pretty cool temperature of that phase transition. The point where

106
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.210
David Schaich (he): it occurs where there is a discontinuity in a derivative of the mechanization

107
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.390
David Schaich (he): that is. the critical temperature.

108
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:24.360
David Schaich (he): right inverse critical temperature.

109
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:31.810
David Schaich (he): or the to be using model is no exactly one half. one

110
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.500
David Schaich (he): of one plus square root of 2,

111
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:42.470
David Schaich (he): which is absolutely 4. Point 4, 4. So an inverse temperature a little about 2

112
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.590
David Schaich (he): in between him. the 2 and 2.5

113
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.110
David Schaich (he): examples we

114
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.460
David Schaich (he): just looked at previously at this phase transition.

115
00:09:54.630 --> 00:10:06.160
David Schaich (he): The behavior of the system is characterized by these dual names for me at all different length scales. So it's small black patches.

116
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.860
These march my patches

117
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.730
David Schaich (he): up to the overall size. I'll pull my out of speed and considered.

118
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:30.110
David Schaich (he): So that is what we were able to get out of considering the hang on low temperature. This is the using model. If there are your questions about this limits which

119
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:37.260
David Schaich (he): repeats the basic form of calculations you've done several times. For precisely this reason.

120
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.780
David Schaich (he): I know we can move on to

121
00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:45.530
David Schaich (he): the second of the 3 ways of approaching, using all the suggested by it.

122
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.020
David Schaich (he): The account for today, something to etc.

123
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:56.560
David Schaich (he): You want to take the same sort of approach that if I took to the complicated

124
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.880
David Schaich (he): interactions with the

125
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.680
David Schaich (he): that he was able to model as a

126
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:12.230
David Schaich (he): ideal, not a direct and gas of particles and other phones you want to find some approximation to

127
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.350
David Schaich (he): the easy model that

128
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.280
David Schaich (he): it's rid of these interactions and gives us a

129
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:24.950
David Schaich (he): approximate model in terms of.

130
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.360
David Schaich (he): So

131
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:39.170
David Schaich (he): where we approach. This is to go back to the

132
00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:46.720
David Schaich (he): considerations of the that we ended with. Last week. We saw that the

133
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.380
David Schaich (he): magnetization was related to

134
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:59.730
David Schaich (he): the average spin. So something over all of this in the lattice, divided by that total number.

135
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.930
David Schaich (he): gives us the

136
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.810
and this holds as well. If we look at the

137
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:19.680
David Schaich (he): expectation value averaging over all possible and configurations. We didn't either exponential points and factors. So that really means that the magnetization

138
00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.040
you consider just to be

139
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:29.410
David Schaich (he): me value of the

140
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:43.850
David Schaich (he): for a given temperature and external magnetic field. These expectation values some overhaul of the possible spin configurations, and therefore independence of

141
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.140
David Schaich (he): the values. Are any of all of this.

142
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.020
David Schaich (he): and a basic

143
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.800
David Schaich (he): correct almost to use

144
00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:02.680
David Schaich (he): too simple to you, worth considering. These 2,

145
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.630
David Schaich (he): and and subtract this mean spin

146
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.820
David Schaich (he): in the interactions term that here is in the

147
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:22.100
David Schaich (he): energy for the user model Sj. Times, Sc. Or you to arbitrary Us. Neighborhoods

148
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.020
David Schaich (he): just correct

149
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:30.230
David Schaich (he): the expectation value from each of those skills

150
00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:34.930
David Schaich (he): in place. Nothing.

151
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.720
David Schaich (he): it's happened, probably

152
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.370
David Schaich (he): able to. We organize.

153
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.620
David Schaich (he): You know, the whole system

154
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.390
David Schaich (he): in terms of

155
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:59.330
David Schaich (he): this means spin the magnetization. So this is expanding through

156
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.940
David Schaich (he): the products of those 2 terms.

157
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.880
David Schaich (he): You know what we can suppose as our approximation

158
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.080
David Schaich (he): is that.

159
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:19.670
David Schaich (he): on average.

160
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.010
David Schaich (he): you're all in the

161
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.940
David Schaich (he): projector.

162
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.710
David Schaich (he): There is back again.

163
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:37.510
David Schaich (he): On average. there are all these small populations

164
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:46.770
David Schaich (he): around that mean value of the spin. It is the

165
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:56.030
David Schaich (he): is the average value of the spin. We organize things in terms of fluctuations around it.

166
00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:01.450
David Schaich (he): The fluctuations on any given configuration going on

167
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:08.080
David Schaich (he): one term to the next are necessarily

168
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.460
David Schaich (he): and only one of those can

169
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:15.100
David Schaich (he): by that mean value. But if we average over a large number of spins.

170
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.790
David Schaich (he): you can

171
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.820
David Schaich (he): suppose that this product of 2 small fluctuations

172
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.530
David Schaich (he): is going to.

173
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.360
David Schaich (he): and Bill is so make me

174
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.410
David Schaich (he): with the bulk of the system being caught in the

175
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:43.030
David Schaich (he): 2 million in terms which are all that are left. Yeah. The energy that we have

176
00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.350
David Schaich (he): on the screen. Briefly, the energy for the using a model.

177
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.800
David Schaich (he): This takes the form

178
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:18.220
David Schaich (he): mine. This is some over all the

179
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.530
David Schaich (he): these 2 factors.

180
00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.700
David Schaich (he): It means, then.

181
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.960
the organization

182
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.200
David Schaich (he): squared.

183
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.620
David Schaich (he): and we still have.

184
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.050
David Schaich (he): and magnetic field.

185
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.490
David Schaich (he): Right

186
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.930
David Schaich (he): now. What we can do is this magnetization square, we've said, is independent of all the

187
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:53.580
David Schaich (he): all the spin configurations. It's just a constant that's

188
00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:57.800
David Schaich (he): will be counted by the number of links in the lattice.

189
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.190
David Schaich (he): You see there are to the links.

190
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.030
and it.

191
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.380
you know, to be factors of the cost of

192
00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:19.650
David Schaich (he): magnetization squared. And then in the other term we do have dependence on Jk.

193
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:23.940
David Schaich (he): This will be 2 spins that are at the end of the link between them.

194
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:30.060
David Schaich (he): As we some over all of the links in the lattice, we will

195
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.060
David Schaich (he): pick up

196
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.910
David Schaich (he): every single spin

197
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.330
we

198
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.730
David Schaich (he): number of times that

199
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:53.310
David Schaich (he): hold on and spins. Yeah.

200
00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:58.610
David Schaich (he): each of those n spins has 2D and links attached to it.

201
00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.380
David Schaich (he): So

202
00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.290
David Schaich (he): each of these spins

203
00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.350
David Schaich (he): here 2D times

204
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.230
David Schaich (he): in that, some over.

205
00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.990
David Schaich (he): and the links.

206
00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:25.620
David Schaich (he): So we have it. and the factors of the Council of my organization square. and then

207
00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:31.530
David Schaich (he): to the links for each spin that we can combine.

208
00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.070
David Schaich (he): I'll be just doing that.

209
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.680
David Schaich (he): and

210
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:44.760
David Schaich (he): this

211
00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:52.200
David Schaich (he): with the energy. the phones so called

212
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.520
David Schaich (he): approximation

213
00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:00.280
David Schaich (he): in tweets. This combination of

214
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:06.220
David Schaich (he): number of nearest neighbors of each spin and the external field as

215
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.340
David Schaich (he): an effective may, I feel. yeah.

216
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:18.400
David Schaich (he): each on average fields. by virtue of averaging over

217
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.050
David Schaich (he): all of this to the nearest neighbors.

218
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:38.710
David Schaich (he): so sorry to if the 2 is in the end soft at first, or there any questions about

219
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:48.320
David Schaich (he): how we got to this expression for the energy as an approximation to the easy model.

220
00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:57.360
David Schaich (he): Maybe one question could be. Why are we operating with this?

221
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.700
Yeah.

222
00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.400
David Schaich (he): go back to the question we asked.

223
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.250
David Schaich (he): what happens to

224
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.470
David Schaich (he): this mean field energy

225
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:17.920
David Schaich (he): that we

226
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:25.340
David Schaich (he): make an alteration through the random speed that in the system

227
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.100
David Schaich (he): all that we can do with the spin is flip it.

228
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:29.830
David Schaich (he): So if we

229
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:31.900
David Schaich (he): hey, guys.

230
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.360
David Schaich (he): I was really Sj.

231
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:46.820
David Schaich (he): Some over

232
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.550
David Schaich (he): all the spins.

233
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.180
David Schaich (he): and then.

234
00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.980
David Schaich (he): with that degree of freedom. Well.

235
00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.800
David Schaich (he): it's the Times and

236
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.200
David Schaich (he): I'm.

237
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.110
And

238
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.610
David Schaich (he): in configuration we just kick off

239
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.280
David Schaich (he): unaffected.

240
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.210
The resulting change of energy from altering this degree of freedom

241
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.480
David Schaich (he): is twice that

242
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:28.970
David Schaich (he): you, for your freedom itself

243
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:30.670
it was.

244
00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:34.870
David Schaich (he): is

245
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:45.330
David Schaich (he): independent of. or the my good to Jay. which is our definition.

246
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:58.660
David Schaich (he): I'll be statistical system which we can expect dramatic simplifications. behavior like spectralization.

247
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:07.010
David Schaich (he): But we haven't gotten all the way back to non attracting spin system. But we

248
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.150
David Schaich (he): 6 months ago there is still.

249
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.110
David Schaich (he): I think, using mobile interaction

250
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.170
David Schaich (he): in the form of this

251
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:26.420
David Schaich (he): effective maybe I feel that depends on the

252
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.080
David Schaich (he): and

253
00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:36.380
I have dropped invited to see that there is a.

254
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.730
David Schaich (he): and

255
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:39.390
that so

256
00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.810
David Schaich (he): explicitly.

257
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.420
David Schaich (he): Times my organization.

258
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:58.510
David Schaich (he): What's the external magnetic field and that role of an organization? It's going to give us different behavior compared to

259
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.170
David Schaich (he): not a

260
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.530
David Schaich (he): starting to see that. as always is.

261
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:05.980
David Schaich (he): If you do that the

262
00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.230
David Schaich (he): partition function good. Indeed!

263
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:19.040
David Schaich (he): The partition function

264
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:32.060
David Schaich (he): you can get to all of the internal energy entropy. And now the for our system. So you

265
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.950
David Schaich (he): approximation

266
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:43.950
David Schaich (he): that we have sums over all possible configurations on the spin.

267
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.460
David Schaich (he): It's the energy

268
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.330
David Schaich (he): negative science, yet

269
00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:55.390
David Schaich (he): it's not

270
00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:03.810
David Schaich (he): so. We have in the some of us, and configurations exponential.

271
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.710
David Schaich (he): It's inverse temperature times

272
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.680
for a few times, and

273
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:12.720
David Schaich (he): and then

274
00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:21.260
David Schaich (he): so over all of all of the space

275
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.860
David Schaich (he): and what we can

276
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:34.920
David Schaich (he): you right away. that exponential. you

277
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.840
David Schaich (he): and square the constant factor that.

278
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:49.430
David Schaich (he): And then what remains in this cell over spin configurations

279
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:52.580
David Schaich (he): is an exponential of a sum

280
00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:58.650
David Schaich (he): over Sn. It just has. we saw in the long track, in case

281
00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:08.220
David Schaich (he): factorizes into a product of songs over each of those

282
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.280
David Schaich (he): individual.

283
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:25.140
David Schaich (he): That's one that same factor for spin 2 so long all the way up to you can spend.

284
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:39.240
David Schaich (he): So each of these again, just as before. We all yeah.

285
00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.850
David Schaich (he): it's some of 2 terms e to the plus

286
00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:44.090
David Schaich (he): yeah h

287
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.420
David Schaich (he): plus e to the minus beta h, which is twice the

288
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.940
David Schaich (he): I don't really care about how, since

289
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:59.670
David Schaich (he): factors out front. So what is called that, c. You get twice. I have the most close sign

290
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:04.260
David Schaich (he): I don't

291
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:12.680
David Schaich (he): for each of the in terms in this product. and just to be explicit you have

292
00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:15.960
David Schaich (he): in.

293
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:20.160
David Schaich (he): I could all the to assign now

294
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.640
David Schaich (he): the Beta times to the as an organization.

295
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:32.980
David Schaich (he): What's the all of that is raised to the

296
00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:37.950
David Schaich (he): so? It is

297
00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:50.790
David Schaich (he): the same form as we had, for not the tracking spins empowers the hyperbolic to assign it. But now there's a complication that inside the mean field partition function itself

298
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:55.400
David Schaich (he): is the expectation value of the organization

299
00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.930
David Schaich (he): which we saw last time.

300
00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.150
David Schaich (he): It's proportional to

301
00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:07.190
David Schaich (he): of the log of the partition function for the full system.

302
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.110
David Schaich (he): Want to ensure that

303
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.710
David Schaich (he): the setup is self-consistent.

304
00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.920
David Schaich (he): Then the mechanization that we get out

305
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:25.650
David Schaich (he): of the meeting fuel partition function. and that' be

306
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.020
David Schaich (he): identifiable.

307
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.280
David Schaich (he): It was in

308
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:44.990
David Schaich (he): some order for this expression, for partition function makes sense. You have to demand the mechanization it's given.

309
00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.170
David Schaich (he): I think, derivative

310
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.750
David Schaich (he): partition function

311
00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:09.140
David Schaich (he): In addition to i'm responding to that same expression for the full interacting easy model. Yeah. This is a calculation that

312
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.680
David Schaich (he): we have already done that we can

313
00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:18.520
David Schaich (he): essentially see a following inspection: the one over and out from us.

314
00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:26.910
David Schaich (he): Yeah, there, you one of the the H appears in the argument behind all cosine.

315
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:29.900
It was

316
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.680
David Schaich (he): one over that

317
00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.640
David Schaich (he): i'll structure.

318
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:40.730
David Schaich (he): She will go through.

319
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:59.730
David Schaich (he): and finally another round of change. a factor of Beta on the

320
00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.860
David Schaich (he): the one over Beta we had out front. So in the end

321
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.580
David Schaich (he): just yes. the familiar hydraulic tangent.

322
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.320
David Schaich (he): I would pay the times that effective magnetic field

323
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:19.330
David Schaich (he): We'll keep in terms of the magnetization.

324
00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:20.940
David Schaich (he): And you.

325
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.910
David Schaich (he): actual.

326
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.850
David Schaich (he): What we have here is

327
00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.320
David Schaich (he): the transcendental equation

328
00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:36.280
David Schaich (he): that release the left hand side

329
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:42.340
David Schaich (he): to itself in the argument of the hyperbolic tangent.

330
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.920
David Schaich (he): so a ratio of exponential factors.

331
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:49.190
David Schaich (he): It has the mechanization in this.

332
00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.240
David Schaich (he): so this relation that the organization is equal to

333
00:29:54.410 --> 00:30:00.190
David Schaich (he): the tension itself with factors of the and the external magnetic field.

334
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:04.880
David Schaich (he): This is the condition

335
00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:12.490
David Schaich (he): for the system to be self-consistent.

336
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:18.060
David Schaich (he): this one given by

337
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.250
David Schaich (he): that mean fuel calculation.

338
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.470
David Schaich (he): the assumption that

339
00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:27.080
David Schaich (he): fluctuations

340
00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.890
David Schaich (he): around the mean spin

341
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.930
David Schaich (he): on average. are small.

342
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:39.880
David Schaich (he): Yeah, in order to solve the self consistency condition.

343
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:42.120
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

344
00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:49.260
David Schaich (he): easiest way to go from looking into a computer is to

345
00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:54.190
David Schaich (he): but the left and right hand side of this equation.

346
00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:58.600
David Schaich (he): What maximization

347
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.540
David Schaich (he): and this hyperbolic, the engines.

348
00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:09.400
David Schaich (he): 2D animal plus each.

349
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:13.620
David Schaich (he): So

350
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:21.060
David Schaich (he): yeah, I look to see where the 2 sides of the equation agree with those 2 curves

351
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:23.820
David Schaich (he): intersect.

352
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:25.980
David Schaich (he): So

353
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:32.000
David Schaich (he): this is how that sort of thing

354
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.360
David Schaich (he): attempt to

355
00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.800
David Schaich (he): challenge my

356
00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:40.710
David Schaich (he): just.

357
00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:55.070
David Schaich (he): These curves should come out as nicely as I and my through applied program. So we have those 2 functions on it versus the average magnetization.

358
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:55.970
David Schaich (he): Of course the

359
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.680
David Schaich (he): my

360
00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.010
David Schaich (he): is

361
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:10.220
David Schaich (he): just the hyper of all tangents.

362
00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.330
David Schaich (he): Oh, and it's so. which

363
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.410
David Schaich (he): we'll get to

364
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:26.080
David Schaich (he): the expression we have over here. Hi! So here V equals to working with the two-dimensional easing model.

365
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:29.760
David Schaich (he): same the

366
00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:37.360
David Schaich (he): and turning off the

367
00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.500
David Schaich (he): we have

368
00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.900
David Schaich (he): and i'll stage

369
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:55.780
David Schaich (he): go into H to 0

370
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:59.290
David Schaich (he): 2 times 2 is 4 over 4 is one. Just the

371
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:11.180
David Schaich (he): that is shown here, where we can see my inspection that there is only a single intersection. Yes.

372
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.640
David Schaich (he): the vanishing value of the maximization

373
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.570
David Schaich (he): similar

374
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.910
David Schaich (he): to be fully explosive

375
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.390
David Schaich (he): intersection

376
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.840
David Schaich (he): at M. Equals 0. We can identify

377
00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:35.910
David Schaich (he): and

378
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.860
David Schaich (he): disorder phase

379
00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:42.970
David Schaich (he): of the easy model

380
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:55.520
David Schaich (he): that is being reproduce for this particular temperature or magnetic field and number dimensions from that mean fuel approximation.

381
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.940
David Schaich (he): So

382
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:10.360
David Schaich (he): the question now becomes out of these. this intersections, or this root following procedure?

383
00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:13.560
David Schaich (he): What is that

384
00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:18.199
David Schaich (he): when you don't just have the simplest possible choice

385
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.310
David Schaich (he): of

386
00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:24.159
David Schaich (he): arguments simplifying that hyperbolic tangent.

387
00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:29.000
David Schaich (he): So

388
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:45.179
David Schaich (he): we'll keep 2 dimensions fixed for remain your own. Today we saw that with each is of 0 temperature of 4.

389
00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:55.409
David Schaich (he): The mean fuel approximation put us in. You just want to face

390
00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.690
David Schaich (he): the vanishing magnetization

391
00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:06.000
David Schaich (he): if we hold on a non-zero

392
00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:09.210
in the field.

393
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:14.980
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

394
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:21.320
David Schaich (he): keeping everything else. The same so still 2 mentioned temperature of 4.

395
00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.330
David Schaich (he): What happens in the

396
00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:28.720
David Schaich (he): arguments of that hyperbolic tensions? Is that

397
00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.880
David Schaich (he): a positive magnetic field?

398
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.290
David Schaich (he): What calls do you?

399
00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:40.270
David Schaich (he): This particular is

400
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.500
David Schaich (he): last 2 units of magnetic field.

401
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:48.040
David Schaich (he): whereas a negative magnetic field shifts everything to the right.

402
00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:52.530
David Schaich (he): and the intersection that we have between

403
00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:01.080
David Schaich (he): and the hyperbolic tangent shifts along with the tangent.

404
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:07.010
David Schaich (he): I'm. Sorry. I just simply non-zero value.

405
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.380
David Schaich (he): and let's see

406
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.120
David Schaich (he): I can feed on the screen.

407
00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.910
David Schaich (he): What was your age?

408
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.500
David Schaich (he): Just those 200 functions

409
00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.810
David Schaich (he): the intersection

410
00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:34.770
David Schaich (he): at

411
00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:42.990
David Schaich (he): call, and not

412
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.370
David Schaich (he): We are right.

413
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:53.150
David Schaich (he): plus or minus 2 getting up with.

414
00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:58.930
David Schaich (he): and not as that 4.9. You can read all the

415
00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:04.210
David Schaich (he): minimum of the maximum value of the

416
00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:12.170
David Schaich (he): that we know we should bound our organization. We are most of the way there with this guy, you of the magnetic field.

417
00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.250
David Schaich (he): So what we have now with the

418
00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:19.270
David Schaich (he): this is again

419
00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:26.040
David Schaich (he): lion, yet

420
00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.490
David Schaich (he): with the external.

421
00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:34.240
David Schaich (he): any questions about

422
00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:45.920
David Schaich (he): that first step of exploring the possible possible solutions to a transcendental self consistency Addition

423
00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.870
David Schaich (he): the

424
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:59.870
David Schaich (he): deal with. In addition to this magnetic field. Use the temperature right.

425
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:04.780
David Schaich (he): You can see. looking back to.

426
00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:07.860
David Schaich (he): you know.

427
00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:12.290
to work with.

428
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:20.510
David Schaich (he): reduce the temperature larger than all you.

429
00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:24.250
David Schaich (he): You know

430
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:35.790
David Schaich (he): this expression. everything else staying in the same. And then, as the mechanization changes, this merger Beta.

431
00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:39.580
David Schaich (he): we'll pump up the change in the

432
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:49.270
David Schaich (he): so we will see the faster change between the plus one and minus one minutes

433
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:52.600
David Schaich (he): of the all tangents

434
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:59.000
David Schaich (he): which is showing this next figure he

435
00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.610
David Schaich (he): 2 dimensions.

436
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.200
David Schaich (he): 2 years of

437
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:12.080
David Schaich (he): the magnetic field, plus or minus 2. The

438
00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:20.680
David Schaich (he): now I do see the temperature of 4 2. The data is it half rather than a quarter.

439
00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:27.190
David Schaich (he): the yes shifts between minus one to one

440
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:29.650
David Schaich (he): more quickly than before.

441
00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.270
David Schaich (he): and the resulting interception with

442
00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:40.970
David Schaich (he): to the cell phone. also ships to

443
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:44.410
David Schaich (he): of what

444
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:48.980
David Schaich (he): On this

445
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.470
David Schaich (he): my organization approaches it Maximum value

446
00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:01.330
David Schaich (he): an actual magnitude. I should say.

447
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.700
David Schaich (he): plus or minus one and lower temperature. So that is

448
00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:10.490
David Schaich (he): reassuringly consistent with what we saw last week.

449
00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.780
David Schaich (he): looking at the absence.

450
00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:20.570
David Schaich (he): and

451
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:25.440
David Schaich (he): probably the work that we did last week without any magnetic field

452
00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:26.890
public today.

453
00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:36.520
David Schaich (he): We should expect. If this mean fuel, approximation really is a good approximation to the easing model. we should see this appearance of an ordered phase.

454
00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:40.590
David Schaich (he): even without an external fuel to

455
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.030
David Schaich (he): of all the spins

456
00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:47.640
David Schaich (he): as we were seeing

457
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:50.250
David Schaich (he): that was a so

458
00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:57.050
David Schaich (he): from okay low temperature model last week.

459
00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:04.540
David Schaich (he): you expect at this order phase should be presence.

460
00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:11.840
David Schaich (he): Even when we turn off the

461
00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:24.870
David Schaich (he): to explore this, we can do so. Set H. Equals 0. Configure it. 3 values. or that temperature, 2, 4, and 8

462
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:28.570
David Schaich (he): blue, 1, 2

463
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:30.080
David Schaich (he): green to red.

464
00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:36.210
David Schaich (he): Beta is itself, and decreasing from what half to a quarter.

465
00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:39.660
David Schaich (he): 2 and 8. As the temperature it's higher.

466
00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.540
David Schaich (he): so you can see up here that

467
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:48.880
David Schaich (he): that disorder phase

468
00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:52.220
David Schaich (he): is always a possible solution.

469
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.330
David Schaich (he): All of these groups

470
00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:59.300
David Schaich (he): really H. Equals 0 pass through

471
00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:03.770
David Schaich (he): the origin.

472
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.350
David Schaich (he): It's 0.

473
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:10.100
David Schaich (he): So let me compare

474
00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:15.620
David Schaich (he): those 3 temperatures. A disorder based solution

475
00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:19.140
David Schaich (he): is always possible.

476
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.570
David Schaich (he): You can see just by visual inspection

477
00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:30.050
David Schaich (he): in the lowest half of your case t equals 2.

478
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:33.620
David Schaich (he): We have additional solutions.

479
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:36.620
David Schaich (he): we from 0 an organization

480
00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.670
David Schaich (he): in particular, you

481
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.640
David Schaich (he): Oh, God!

482
00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:49.840
David Schaich (he): Positive, negative. Now I use at the same magnitude, and not

483
00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.730
David Schaich (he): so we have additional solutions.

484
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:57.020
David Schaich (he): Go along.

485
00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:03.060
David Schaich (he): Nationalization possibility.

486
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.350
David Schaich (he): Just get him.

487
00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:06.980
We we

488
00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:10.560
David Schaich (he): you have that non-zero, and not

489
00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:17.950
David Schaich (he): as an additional solution at low temperature there.

490
00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:23.140
David Schaich (he): Yes.

491
00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:26.020
David Schaich (he): he decreases down to 0.

492
00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:33.550
David Schaich (he): So for this inspection it's not clear what exactly is going on in that

493
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:34.870
David Schaich (he): low temperature

494
00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:37.930
David Schaich (he): regime, where we seem to have a both

495
00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.400
David Schaich (he): ordered and disordered solutions even possible.

496
00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:44.600
David Schaich (he): Just a few more minutes to

497
00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.810
David Schaich (he): answer that question.

498
00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:49.530
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

499
00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:56.220
David Schaich (he): the answer might be quick. So we'll come back to it next week.

500
00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:09.430
David Schaich (he): Let's consider what what happened. If we were to start with the system at? Yeah, I'm asking self- vanishing value of My organization.

501
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:13.960
David Schaich (he): Yeah, we you have a little kick you for screw

502
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:17.930
David Schaich (he): the value of the organization. It's just a random fluctuation.

503
00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:23.790
David Schaich (he): Takes it to so very small non-zero positive number. Absolutely.

504
00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.930
David Schaich (he): If we we get that red curve, the high temperature.

505
00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:38.470
David Schaich (he): you can see that as soon as

506
00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:51.770
David Schaich (he): the value of the organization is no 0, we should absolutely in that direction. The red curve is too small compared to

507
00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.210
David Schaich (he): be consistent with

508
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.680
David Schaich (he): same thing in that.

509
00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.840
David Schaich (he): You know the way that's

510
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:07.730
David Schaich (he): it's larger

511
00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.160
David Schaich (he): that you instructor.

512
00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.030
David Schaich (he): So in order to

513
00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:21.260
David Schaich (he): it back to a self-

514
00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:26.070
David Schaich (he): The system will want to reduce the organization that is too large.

515
00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:32.300
David Schaich (he): which we'll send it back in to the question where it started off.

516
00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:37.810
David Schaich (he): So

517
00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:41.200
David Schaich (he): yes.

518
00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.660
David Schaich (he): any equals 0 solution

519
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:48.810
David Schaich (he): is these people

520
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:54.070
David Schaich (he): equilibrium or any fluctuation away from it, will immediately be

521
00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:55.390
David Schaich (he): corrected.

522
00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:59.230
David Schaich (he): My virtue of magnetization being

523
00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:10.440
David Schaich (he): too large and not surprisingly. You can see that the situation is the opposite. The low temperature is the view curve. As soon as we get

524
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:13.000
David Schaich (he): absolutely shifting from

525
00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:18.530
David Schaich (he): the origin. The organization is too small compared with him.

526
00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.760
David Schaich (he): In order to

527
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.900
David Schaich (he): returns, we self-consistence equilibrium.

528
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:35.230
David Schaich (he): The system will what to

529
00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:39.860
David Schaich (he): increase my organization to try to get back into

530
00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:44.410
David Schaich (he): self-consistent agreement with the other side of the equation.

531
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.090
David Schaich (he): In other words.

532
00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:53.280
David Schaich (he): give it even a if it is a small fluctuation away from 0.

533
00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:57.670
David Schaich (he): The system will want to keep going to

534
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:04.150
David Schaich (he): values of the

535
00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:09.930
David Schaich (he): you see

536
00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:16.490
David Schaich (he): self- Yeah, we'll eventually find that

537
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:21.150
David Schaich (he): once it reaches and not and

538
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:26.740
David Schaich (he): happened.

539
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:32.160
David Schaich (he): The fluctuation is in the other directions. We go to

540
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:34.510
David Schaich (he): the negative

541
00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.290
David Schaich (he): solution.

542
00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:40.390
David Schaich (he): So

543
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:44.500
David Schaich (he): the conclusion for today

544
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:46.730
David Schaich (he): it's really out of time

545
00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:54.000
David Schaich (he): is the actual temperatures. Where we have these 3 solutions to our self consistency condition.

546
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:59.530
David Schaich (he): the one at vanishing magnetization is unstable. Any fluctuation around it.

547
00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:02.180
David Schaich (he): We'll send the system off

548
00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:07.600
David Schaich (he): to one of the other of the order solutions

549
00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:09.840
David Schaich (he): that you.

550
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:11.100
The conclusion is

551
00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:14.830
David Schaich (he): in

552
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:20.790
David Schaich (he): this setup with low temperature and no external magnetic field.

553
00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:29.720
David Schaich (he): Successfully we produce our expectation on the order of phase

554
00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:32.520
David Schaich (he): appearing at the

555
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.630
David Schaich (he): your temperatures

556
00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:42.550
David Schaich (he): within all 0 value of that organization.

557
00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:50.030
David Schaich (he): So that's all that we have time for today. Hopefully

558
00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.590
David Schaich (he): this argument about stability and instability. His

559
00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:59.850
David Schaich (he): we are, even though

560
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:01.630
David Schaich (he): there is

561
00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:05.200
David Schaich (he): you coming in the chat window.

562
00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:10.850
David Schaich (he): Do we have a focus of the exam?

563
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:23.390
David Schaich (he): You know, we can spend that some of the time in the tutorial on Thursday talking about Exam Review a separate issue. That's also something we can. Video next Monday.

564
00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:34.290
David Schaich (he): There are as well those 3 sample exams now with solutions on canvas. and i'll encourage you to

565
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:41.940
David Schaich (he): probably going through the sample exams before looking at the solutions, just because that's how you get those set of practicing them

566
00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:48.620
David Schaich (he): Further questions before you call it an afternoon with the main field approximation.

567
00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.860
David Schaich (he): Yes, it will be very similar to them.

568
00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:04.650
David Schaich (he): It's 2 h rather than the 1 h that we had last year, which will give you more time to

569
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.100
David Schaich (he): work on things.

570
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:11.150
David Schaich (he): And yeah, those exams are uploaded because they are

571
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:14.220
David Schaich (he): good guides to what you will be, seeing.

572
00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:20.720
David Schaich (he): so that stop recording it. that let you go.
