1
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.510
David Schaich (he): Okay, we should be

2
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.780
David Schaich (he): pretty much set up.

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.390
David Schaich (he): So, good morning, folks.  I hope the first week of the term

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.049
has gone well for you so far.

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.689
David Schaich (he): What we have

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.459
David Schaich (he): here is... something very much out of focus.

7
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.840
David Schaich (he): That's a bit better.

8
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.119
David Schaich (he): Thursday, at the start of February, and the

9
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.469
David Schaich (he): 6-digit code

10
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.540
David Schaich (he): for today is

11
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.160
David Schaich (he): 1, 4,

12
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.880
David Schaich (he): 3, 4, 2, 2.

13
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.180
David Schaich (he): And, it's

14
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.470
David Schaich (he): still not the

15
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.850
David Schaich (he): best focus there...

16
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.739
David Schaich (he): So the first tutorial for statistical physics. My understanding is that

17
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.710
David Schaich (he): tutorials are

18
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.369
David Schaich (he): supposed to shut up and let you have some of.

19
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.880
David Schaich (he): So

20
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.729
David Schaich (he): I have

21
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.920
David Schaich (he): taken

22
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.020
David Schaich (he): some of the stuff that was in the lecture notes, and

23
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.589
David Schaich (he): chop it all into a

24
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.880
David Schaich (he): the tutorial activity for you to

25
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.770
David Schaich (he): work on Today I will be

26
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.059
David Schaich (he): uploaded

27
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.309
David Schaich (he): all of the model solutions for this activity, but it's still

28
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.570
David Schaich (he): useful for you to actually do it yourself. Is that how you you practice

29
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.040
David Schaich (he): doing statistical physics calculations, and depending on

30
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.559
David Schaich (he): how it goes for you today. There is not 105, but i'll keep an eye on

31
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.150
David Schaich (he): I'm. On my phone, depending on how you can, all

32
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.080
David Schaich (he): With this activity

33
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.239
David Schaich (he): you can start to encounter some of the Python programming that also focus on

34
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.690
David Schaich (he): a bit more detail on

35
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.760
David Schaich (he): computer lab on Tuesday and training for that computer project. Speaking of which

36
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.329
David Schaich (he): maybe I should

37
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.320
David Schaich (he): mentioned before we go on, that

38
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.590
David Schaich (he): the computer project is up and active for you to check out

39
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.840
David Schaich (he): in advance of Tuesday. So do when

40
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.469
David Schaich (he): little under 3 weeks.

41
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:19.860
David Schaich (he): and it

42
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.160
David Schaich (he): looks

43
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.860
David Schaich (he): maybe more substantial than it is

44
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.519
David Schaich (he): because it's got

45
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.730
David Schaich (he): a lot of

46
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.650
David Schaich (he): the usual instructions, but also

47
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.440
David Schaich (he): relevant background material that

48
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.010
David Schaich (he): hopefully, it will be useful to have

49
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.850
David Schaich (he): close to hand here in the

50
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.160
David Schaich (he): assignment itself, rather than hiding in

51
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.459
David Schaich (he): that demo.

52
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.019
David Schaich (he): So

53
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.900
David Schaich (he): python programming or

54
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.869
David Schaich (he): elsewhere in the lecture notes. So 5

55
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.269
David Schaich (he): exercises which have

56
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.220
David Schaich (he): 3 weeks to do in those computer labs

57
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.310
David Schaich (he): the deadline.

58
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.660
David Schaich (he): It's not set When I requested it. It is actually just a couple of hours after they

59
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:13.120
David Schaich (he): that third computer lab. So ideally, it will have things mostly under control by the time you come in for that last one on

60
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.299
David Schaich (he): twenty-first of February itself.

61
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.240
David Schaich (he): And just

62
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.670
David Schaich (he): there we go and finish it already.

63
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.100
David Schaich (he): But

64
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.879
David Schaich (he): are there immediate questions about those logistics, or indeed anything we've seen over this week

65
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.570
David Schaich (he): before we jump into

66
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.140
David Schaich (he): little activity, for today is 2 to 0.

67
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.919
David Schaich (he): Not seeing any. I'll hop back here and point out that 6 digit covered again.

68
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.209
David Schaich (he): 1, 4, 3, 4, 2, 2.

69
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.400
You supposed to have that

70
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.280
David Schaich (he): you get off of this page

71
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.070
David Schaich (he): as the

72
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.720
David Schaich (he): activity

73
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.069
David Schaich (he): looking at what requires zooming out is

74
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.469
David Schaich (he): the game based on

75
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.210
David Schaich (he): the rule that we all that we saw

76
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.790
David Schaich (he): on Monday.

77
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.239
David Schaich (he): So this is

78
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.950
David Schaich (he): slightly edited

79
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.329
David Schaich (he): version of the

80
00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:23.239
David Schaich (he): figure that I had up on Monday and scroll down there with some

81
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.940
David Schaich (he): still not great with this on this

82
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.280
David Schaich (he): here will

83
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.340
David Schaich (he): little green box highlighting, maybe.

84
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.320
David Schaich (he): Yeah, that is in the corresponding

85
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.799
David Schaich (he): place in the lecture notes.

86
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.409
David Schaich (he): just to brief briefly review what we have with the set up the standard roulette wheel has

87
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.860
David Schaich (he): 37 pockets, with 3 different colors. 18, red, 18, black.

88
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.699
David Schaich (he): and 0 is

89
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.390
David Schaich (he): the special green pocket. There, at the top

90
00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.999
David Schaich (he): you spin the wheel, roll it all, and bet on which pocket that all ends up in as it slows down, it comes to a stop

91
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.340
David Schaich (he): and

92
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.360
David Schaich (he): a simple.

93
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.499
David Schaich (he): but that we couldn't imagine

94
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.300
David Schaich (he): computer. It's a simple example

95
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.979
David Schaich (he): in class earlier in the week

96
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.830
David Schaich (he): or 2.

97
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.449
David Schaich (he): Same place

98
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.900
David Schaich (he): the £5 bets

99
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.729
David Schaich (he): on every spin of the wheel.

100
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.730
David Schaich (he): This this

101
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.590
David Schaich (he): visible

102
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.710
David Schaich (he): to you.

103
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.760
David Schaich (he): Okay.

104
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.060
David Schaich (he): try again. Maybe you do better

105
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.700
David Schaich (he): so.

106
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.310
David Schaich (he): and we will bet.

107
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.250
David Schaich (he): say, on

108
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.920
David Schaich (he): black.

109
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.580
David Schaich (he): So a £5 bet that the ball ends up in one

110
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.240
to you

111
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.440
David Schaich (he): black pockets.

112
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.640
David Schaich (he): which is to say.

113
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.309
David Schaich (he): if the ball.

114
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.350
David Schaich (he): and so

115
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.420
David Schaich (he): in a black pocket

116
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.900
David Schaich (he): we will win

117
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.890
David Schaich (he): twice the amount we put in, so we get £10 back

118
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.109
David Schaich (he): in total. Otherwise, you know 5 time that is just lost.

119
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.180
David Schaich (he): Your question is.

120
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.390
David Schaich (he): What can we expect to?

121
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.390
David Schaich (he): We don't lose, as we repeat, these spins several times, getting into that

122
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.840
David Schaich (he): repetition

123
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.749
David Schaich (he): experiment that we have.

124
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:37.890
David Schaich (he): So.

125
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.440
David Schaich (he): switching back to

126
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.449
David Schaich (he): the canvas sites.

127
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.629
David Schaich (he): you may well have seen

128
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.840
David Schaich (he): the activity. That's

129
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.499
David Schaich (he): it, came up on one day which has

130
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.150
David Schaich (he): the sequence of

131
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.630
David Schaich (he): for

132
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.759
David Schaich (he): questions about this set up.

133
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.710
David Schaich (he): I can

134
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.480
David Schaich (he): zoom in on.

135
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.560
David Schaich (he): Okay, that's the maximum zoom

136
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.090
David Schaich (he): hopefully. That's

137
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.789
David Schaich (he): visible in the back. And if not

138
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.090
okay.

139
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.480
David Schaich (he): one copy of the print out here

140
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.089
David Schaich (he): a laptop, or if you have that handy.

141
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.280
David Schaich (he): So.

142
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.900
David Schaich (he): placing these £5 bits on black, we want to compute

143
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.719
David Schaich (he): the probabilities of winning and losing, and what we get.

144
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.289
David Schaich (he): as again each time.

145
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.420
David Schaich (he): and then start doing some computations of

146
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:44.759
David Schaich (he): the general expressions for both the probabilities that we win some number of times W out of.

147
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.590
David Schaich (he): and total spins

148
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.499
David Schaich (he): of the wheel, computing examples of those, seeing that they're all sensible.

149
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.120
David Schaich (he): and then eventually applying the central limit theorem

150
00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:03.999
David Schaich (he): to this repeated experiment of placing that spinning wheel, getting some probabilistic outcome.

151
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.700
David Schaich (he): and seeing how well the central limit, theorem predicts the exact

152
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:23.859
David Schaich (he): probabilities and wins or losses that we can compute either explicitly for a small number in, or using a computer programming or a more arbitrary value.

153
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.550
David Schaich (he): and just before I pause the recording and let you

154
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:31.679
David Schaich (he): you know with it

155
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.540
David Schaich (he): you this these activities

156
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:36.310
David Schaich (he): i'll mention that

157
00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:42.149
David Schaich (he): as we talked about on Tuesday. I believe the central limit theorem gives us a

158
00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:45.189
David Schaich (he): probability distribution or a density.

159
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.870
David Schaich (he): so to actually extract

160
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.519
David Schaich (he): probabilities from that density that has to be integrated.

161
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.380
David Schaich (he): So that is what

162
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.590
David Schaich (he): this equation is representing here.

163
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.640
David Schaich (he): If we want the probability of

164
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.960
David Schaich (he): gaining some

165
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.480
David Schaich (he): some value corresponding to some number of wins.

166
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:09.749
David Schaich (he): Given the density from the central limit theorem we have to integrate that it can be done

167
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.390
David Schaich (he): either

168
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.399
David Schaich (he): analytically, numerically, or with some

169
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.380
David Schaich (he): approximations, for example, approximating this probability as a constants

170
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:23.480
David Schaich (he): within its limits of integration about the crudest approximation

171
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.790
David Schaich (he): we could have.

172
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.520
David Schaich (he): The integral, then just

173
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.870
David Schaich (he): turns into the product

174
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.810
David Schaich (he): of that constant probability times.

175
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.990
David Schaich (he): the delta she with

176
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.210
David Schaich (he): of the window being integrated over.

177
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:39.670
David Schaich (he): And

178
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.850
David Schaich (he): there are various ways you can

179
00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.910
David Schaich (he): numerically evaluate.

180
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.149
David Schaich (he): I do that integral or.

181
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.550
David Schaich (he): yeah.

182
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.560
David Schaich (he): approximation to it

183
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:57.999
David Schaich (he): practical from Alpha just that websites can handle a numerical integral of this sort.

184
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.610
David Schaich (he): and

185
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.549
David Schaich (he): depending on how you get on

186
00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.490
next

187
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.350
David Schaich (he): 10 or 20 min. With these exercises we could see

188
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.420
David Schaich (he): some python code that has the advantage.

189
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.430
David Schaich (he): That's

190
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:21.189
David Schaich (he): this end. The total number of spins can be elected as a free parameter, Just read in and repeated automatically.

191
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.010
David Schaich (he): Any number you might be interested in

192
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.699
David Schaich (he): within reason, maybe

193
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.619
David Schaich (he): up to a 1 billion or a trillion.

194
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.259
David Schaich (he): One of the advantages of

195
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.690
David Schaich (he): programming solutions.

196
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.740
David Schaich (he): Is it out by hand, especially where you are.

197
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.270
David Schaich (he): But that is the

198
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.210
David Schaich (he): one step in this activity.

199
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.859
David Schaich (he): Also. See if anything is unclear about

200
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.140
David Schaich (he): what you

201
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.680
David Schaich (he): get to play with with this.

202
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.530
David Schaich (he): and not seeing any of

203
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.100
David Schaich (he): but you get off with it.

204
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.040
David Schaich (he): you know, with myself, and

205
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.250
David Schaich (he): check in after 10 min or so

206
00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.550
David Schaich (he): to see

207
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.710
it.

208
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.730
David Schaich (he): I'll actually turn the

209
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.499
David Schaich (he): reporting that all there

210
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.620
David Schaich (he): for a few minutes.

211
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.500
David Schaich (he): and

212
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.300
David Schaich (he): hop over 2 months.

213
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.479
David Schaich (he): These numerical calculations for the the integrations

214
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.010
David Schaich (he): they need to exit full screen

215
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.640
David Schaich (he): could be able to

216
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.300
David Schaich (he): well from Alpha

217
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.449
David Schaich (he): on buttons on this keyboard

218
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.600
David Schaich (he): to go from Alpha Plugin.

219
00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.690
David Schaich (he): Our expression for

220
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.210
David Schaich (he): the probability of density

221
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.069
David Schaich (he): multiplied by

222
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:45.599
David Schaich (he): this Delta G, which I got to be 10,

223
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.870
David Schaich (he): maybe in the interest of wrapping up

224
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.859
David Schaich (he): more or less on time.

225
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.240
David Schaich (he): I will

226
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:56.859
David Schaich (he): head over to.

227
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:06.490
David Schaich (he): I can get this guy to respond. Okay, lost the assignment. But we don't

228
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.639
David Schaich (he): the links to

229
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.470
David Schaich (he): the logistics

230
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:13.890
David Schaich (he): where I can

231
00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.130
David Schaich (he): get to

232
00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.359
David Schaich (he): the Github repository over it in

233
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.250
David Schaich (he): some python code.

234
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.619
David Schaich (he): If it ever loads. That will do these computations.

235
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.320
David Schaich (he): I thought, it is

236
00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.640
David Schaich (he): more than is muted for this.

237
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.640
David Schaich (he): and

238
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.659
David Schaich (he): certainly sufficient.

239
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.060
David Schaich (he): if not necessary.

240
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.529
David Schaich (he): I realized that I may need to

241
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.430
David Schaich (he): log into

242
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.810
David Schaich (he): yet another

243
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.140
David Schaich (he): system here in order to run things.

244
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:00.920
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

245
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.480
David Schaich (he): open up a new notebook.

246
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.830
David Schaich (he): grab the

247
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.120
David Schaich (he): raw Python code.

248
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.750
David Schaich (he): the Github Repository.

249
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:16.070
David Schaich (he): and

250
00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.070
David Schaich (he): I must be logged in

251
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.349
David Schaich (he): a

252
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.099
David Schaich (he): an issue because it's the more password.

253
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.560
David Schaich (he): So it's maybe

254
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.750
David Schaich (he): less of a

255
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.560
David Schaich (he): fun conclusion.

256
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.360
I was hoping for.

257
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.899
David Schaich (he): Everyone is demanding that I.

258
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.150
David Schaich (he): We have accounts.

259
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.050
David Schaich (he): So on this computer I'm.

260
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.009
David Schaich (he): not going to be able to.

261
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.969
We get code in time.

262
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.710
Yeah.

263
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.990
David Schaich (he): is probably not worth

264
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.200
David Schaich (he): looking at.

265
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.070
David Schaich (he): just as it is

266
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.569
David Schaich (he): so sorry about that. Maybe i'll record

267
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.020
David Schaich (he): little additional

268
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.279
David Schaich (he): video showing all how it works. And for you

269
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:49.310
David Schaich (he): my being.

270
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:51.620
David Schaich (he): It was

271
00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.180
David Schaich (he): the results

272
00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.189
David Schaich (he): that it gives just for

273
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:59.200
I wish.

274
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.019
David Schaich (he): look like this: the 6

275
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.650
David Schaich (he): probabilities

276
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.660
David Schaich (he): coming out with

277
00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:08.020
David Schaich (he): direct or exact values, that all those

278
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.719
David Schaich (he): powers, of 18 over 37, and 1,937

279
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.040
coefficients.

280
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.800
circles.

281
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:16.220
David Schaich (he): and then

282
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.020
David Schaich (he): numerically integrating

283
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:26.110
David Schaich (he): prediction from the central limit theorem even for this small number of 5 spins.

284
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.440
David Schaich (he): we will

285
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.110
David Schaich (he): of science that in most cases are Google happen

286
00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.990
David Schaich (he): with the exact circles

287
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:37.939
David Schaich (he): and the improved approximation that the probability of distribution is a constant

288
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:39.190
David Schaich (he): throughout

289
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.650
David Schaich (he): each of these

290
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.099
David Schaich (he): intervals. So

291
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.320
David Schaich (he): plus or minus 5, is a total of 10 for the game.

292
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.079
David Schaich (he): It's getting those red crosses

293
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.759
David Schaich (he): that are still in good agreement with the true values. So this is

294
00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.170
David Schaich (he): something that

295
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:03.350
David Schaich (he): you can look at over the weekend, and

296
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:08.740
David Schaich (he): during the computer lab I have a chance to see what I thought in action. Starting off with the

297
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.719
David Schaich (he): looking at the demo and

298
00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:19.250
David Schaich (he): computer project itself. So that's on Tuesday for Monday. We'll talk about random walks, of which

299
00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.359
David Schaich (he): this from that game was actually an example of the right of my space.

300
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.210
David Schaich (he): So sorry about the

301
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.529
David Schaich (he): probably with showing off python here.

302
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.609
David Schaich (he): but hopefully

303
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.460
David Schaich (he): we have to play with it over the coming weeks.

304
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.510
David Schaich (he): I'll see you

305
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.090
David Schaich (he): on Monday.
