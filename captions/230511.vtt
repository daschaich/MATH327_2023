1
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.770
David Schaich (he): Okay, that should be

2
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.570
David Schaich (he): me all set up, just waiting for

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.410
David Schaich (he): Zoom to confirm

4
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.640
David Schaich (he): that it is recording.

5
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.120
David Schaich (he): We are in the final tutorial of the term, on the eleventh of May, for which the

6
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.140
David Schaich (he): 6-digit code for

7
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.120
David Schaich (he): today is 5, 1,

8
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.620
David Schaich (he): 8, 1, 7, 5.

9
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.340
David Schaich (he): And

10
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.950
David Schaich (he): one quick logistical note, while I

11
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.050
David Schaich (he): try to get this projector to

12
00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:00.650
David Schaich (he): make sure it's easily legible to all of you, is that marking for that last homework assignment remains under way. It'll be done over the weekend.

13
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.000
David Schaich (he): Final makeup lecture on Monday or

14
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:14.610
David Schaich (he): overall issues or questions can be discussed in more detail. But in the meantime the solutions are up on canvas

15
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.830
David Schaich (he): for you to check out without that level of delay.

16
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.950
David Schaich (he): and

17
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:38.950
David Schaich (he): I have a plan for today, but before I get that under way under a questions or requests about topics to cover this last

18
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.510
David Schaich (he): tutorial.

19
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.780
David Schaich (he): maybe it will help if I briefly.

20
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.240
David Schaich (he): it feels

21
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.170
David Schaich (he): that you are hoping for we'll be introducing any additional.

22
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.670
David Schaich (he): And

23
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.990
David Schaich (he): this past week was looking at last structures.

24
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:17.510
David Schaich (he): There were 2 parts to that. First. The conceptual questions related to. If we're health state

25
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.270
David Schaich (he): of the using model on various different lattices.

26
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.070
what

27
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.530
David Schaich (he): So we'll start off with that. And there you.

28
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:46.950
David Schaich (he): rather than going into that fully connected lattice, which is a bit more of a piece of the calculation. we can spend it. I suspect all the remaining time looking at some prep for

29
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:57.360
David Schaich (he): the exam. That's coming up 2 weeks from tomorrow that fully connected lattice You'll just be up also up on canvas.

30
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.390
David Schaich (he): the modules for you, too. check out.

31
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.250
David Schaich (he): You have the time and inclination.

32
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.140
David Schaich (he): So some

33
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.660
David Schaich (he): calculations to exactly solve it.

34
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.900
David Schaich (he): That system.

35
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.690
David Schaich (he): In the meantime, though

36
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.550
one thing I forgot to mention

37
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:29.080
David Schaich (he): last week, when introducing these funny lattice structures. that motivation for us is given by their applications to

38
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.950
David Schaich (he): science and technology. In this case, the

39
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.980
David Schaich (he): also super conductivity which it's popped up previously in this module.

40
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.250
David Schaich (he): and

41
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:49.510
David Schaich (he): what links to electrons being able to flow in materials without any electrical resistance or not, using the energy to heat which.

42
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.490
David Schaich (he): and that they increase the energy efficiency. All sorts of you like products

43
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:06.840
David Schaich (he): with the copy out there, typically in order to be comes to well within one kelvin of absolute 0.

44
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.300
David Schaich (he): There's been a lot of work over

45
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.230
David Schaich (he): the past few decades searching for

46
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.330
David Schaich (he): special that

47
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.230
David Schaich (he): conducted a a high critical temperature.

48
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:25.200
David Schaich (he): and this is an illustration of one of the medals

49
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.220
at the atomic structure

50
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.300
David Schaich (he): of one of those mills it has been discovered with it's called super called activity. In this case

51
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.470
David Schaich (he): us sitting on at about 50 Kg.

52
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.870
David Schaich (he): Which is much easier to reach the still not.

53
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.320
David Schaich (he): and not every day temperature.

54
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.320
David Schaich (he): And what this

55
00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.110
David Schaich (he): physics for lies on is precisely the underlying that structure

56
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:08.520
David Schaich (he): which we can recognize as being based on one of those it's a generalization

57
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.590
David Schaich (he): of the

58
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.410
David Schaich (he): came up as the 3 dimensional version of the introduced last week.

59
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:26.200
David Schaich (he): We have alternating a lot of structures. Yes. combined with

60
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.130
David Schaich (he): it's called something from

61
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:39.010
David Schaich (he): a nitrogen. It's one example of those. and then we alternating last, some structure oxygen.

62
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.030
David Schaich (he): Before I I commit with what's called

63
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.390
David Schaich (he): the

64
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:54.290
David Schaich (he): first extended row of the periodic table, the heavier elephant, so some the exactly atoms in there. But what's more of work is the

65
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.350
David Schaich (he): that allows for about the virtual behavior with

66
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.620
David Schaich (he): some crucial technological applications.

67
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.030
David Schaich (he): Oh, yeah.

68
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:15.320
David Schaich (he): picture showing. I can zoom that can hopefully get a bit better resolution on the page

69
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.550
David Schaich (he): and check you down for

70
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.420
David Schaich (he): questions for requests now that the it is good outland.

71
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.990
David Schaich (he): Just briefly review

72
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.450
David Schaich (he): conceptual questions raised last week about the you ground states of using models on

73
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.140
David Schaich (he): these 3 2 dimensional labs structures, the square lattice.

74
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.860
David Schaich (he): which is also what we do.

75
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.250
David Schaich (he): Yes, in the lectures.

76
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.120
David Schaich (he): the honeycomb lattice.

77
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.230
David Schaich (he): and the

78
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.600
David Schaich (he): I Chemistry secret conductor. interesting behavior. so

79
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:14.390
David Schaich (he): simplifying to turn off that extra. so that you. using all energy.

80
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.970
David Schaich (he): generalize

81
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:27.460
David Schaich (he): J. Capital, J. And the sum over it's been an interaction between the nearest neighbor

82
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.840
David Schaich (he): pairs that are set by the links to the lattice under consideration.

83
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:40.320
David Schaich (he): and we consider. first, the case J. Equals 0.

84
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.130
David Schaich (he): I know the same one

85
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.280
David Schaich (he): in the

86
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:52.220
David Schaich (he): it would be for any one of those

87
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.360
David Schaich (he): life structures in this case.

88
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.340
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

89
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.890
David Schaich (he): yeah, the total energy

90
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.560
David Schaich (he): it's going to be

91
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.429
David Schaich (he): for that the

92
00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.570
David Schaich (he): cubic class.

93
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.730
David Schaich (he): And in terms of the State itself. This corresponds to

94
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:41.909
David Schaich (he): all these things

95
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:57.160
David Schaich (he): in the same direction. and because they can all be there online. pointing out the value of plus one for S, where they can all be aligned pointing down. There are 2

96
00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.060
David Schaich (he): each other of micro states

97
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:05.060
David Schaich (he): with that perhaps the

98
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.290
David Schaich (he): don't need to generate. All this is the line either pointing out or pointing down.

99
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:19.800
David Schaich (he): and yes, one of the other conceptual questions that introduce

100
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.450
David Schaich (he): what you should think about over the week is.

101
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:32.260
David Schaich (he): can these grasses be distinguished from the disordered micro states that

102
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:40.060
David Schaich (he): dominate that high temperatures with the energy becomes effectively irrelevant compared to this habit share.

103
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.060
David Schaich (he): and

104
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.790
David Schaich (he): I guess here it's also an easy answer to this.

105
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:55.070
David Schaich (he): J. Greater than 0 includes and J. Equals one case, which is what we have been looking at in the lectures.

106
00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.140
David Schaich (he): and all this things are one.

107
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.240
David Schaich (he): There's an overall order

108
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:05.830
David Schaich (he): to one

109
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.740
David Schaich (he): how the values of the students are distributed home all the last. All the same.

110
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.020
David Schaich (he): it is for you.

111
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.910
David Schaich (he): Think about those

112
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:26.340
David Schaich (he): spins as corresponding to molecular negative dipole, which was the physical system that

113
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.120
David Schaich (he): motivated the construction of this using model for

114
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.960
David Schaich (he): roughly a 100 years ago. This is

115
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:42.780
David Schaich (he): where the property of feral magnetism provides. It is all of the small mole that's aligned in the same direction to create an overall

116
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.290
David Schaich (he): macroscopic magnetization for that material

117
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:55.470
David Schaich (he): getting back to the lectures for the special case, J. Equals one, and the special case

118
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.380
David Schaich (he): of the

119
00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.800
David Schaich (he): we saw that the

120
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:07.300
David Schaich (he): or a parameter that distinguishes this order phase from the high temperature disorder phase

121
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.430
David Schaich (he): is

122
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:29.770
David Schaich (he): the derivative of the free energy. With respect to the external magnetic field H. And for each of these ground states magnetization. it is either plus one or minus one. So it actually takes that

123
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.360
David Schaich (he): maximum of what?

124
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.520
David Schaich (he): So for you. I've seen the at least

125
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:41.150
David Schaich (he): the example of the square lattice in the lectures.

126
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.050
David Schaich (he): and

127
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:47.040
David Schaich (he): what might be more interesting now is the question of

128
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:52.780
David Schaich (he): how this ground stage depends on the lattice structure.

129
00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.630
David Schaich (he): What happens if we consider a honeycomb or

130
00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:03.910
David Schaich (he): the trying to let us. instead of the square lattice, and you are familiar with

131
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.330
David Schaich (he): Give you another 2. Think about

132
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.980
David Schaich (he): of the dependence will be because it is

133
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.260
David Schaich (he): in this case you get to.

134
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:32.740
David Schaich (he): It's obvious. So when all of these spins are aligned. basically every single link in this. the energy.

135
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:45.220
David Schaich (he): the same in the sense that the spins on either side of it will all be pointed in the same direction. Look at us

136
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.950
David Schaich (he): all this.

137
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.450
David Schaich (he): Yeah. That structure actually has

138
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.740
David Schaich (he): no effect on it. What the ground state is

139
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:16.340
David Schaich (he): in all pre use cases, and. for that matter, any other lattice and any number of dimensions the Ground state will pay positive.

140
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:25.710
David Schaich (he): It's been a couple of J. All of those lattices will have a

141
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.550
David Schaich (he): and all the spins aligned.

142
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.190
David Schaich (he): So with that warm up

143
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:53.630
David Schaich (he): opposite case, Really. take that interactions with J. Consider what happens if it is negative. So the overall negative sign

144
00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:00.070
David Schaich (he): we cancel out with the maybe a sign in this shade give a positive contribution to the spin

145
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:11.820
David Schaich (he): are the same. plus one square root of minus one squared. Let's go to one. So

146
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.190
David Schaich (he): what sort of

147
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.800
David Schaich (he): ground states

148
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.420
David Schaich (he): what we expect in this domain.

149
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:40.000
David Schaich (he): Good morning. started writing, and that. Sorry about the

150
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.670
David Schaich (he): Protector having called resolving some of those

151
00:14:45.770 --> 00:15:00.690
David Schaich (he): letters. Yeah, that was already started going through the conceptual calculations here. Just see observation

152
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.320
David Schaich (he): As time is this

153
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.890
David Schaich (he): positive number.

154
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:13.470
David Schaich (he): and it increases the everything takes us away. probably a bit of an energy

155
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.520
David Schaich (he): microstates, and course all too.

156
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:27.660
David Schaich (he): the ground state. So in in the States we should expect to see you lots of things where

157
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.920
David Schaich (he): and spins on the end of each link are

158
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.470
David Schaich (he): along the opposite directions.

159
00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.370
David Schaich (he): So

160
00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:47.160
David Schaich (he): yeah, minus one negative contribution to the from those

161
00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.810
David Schaich (he): at the ends of each link

162
00:15:52.210 --> 00:16:03.030
David Schaich (he): in particular for the ground state where we want the minimum possible energy. You want to maximize the number of spins.

163
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.060
David Schaich (he): Yes. oppose each other in the

164
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.480
David Schaich (he): yeah, the

165
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:12.910
David Schaich (he): at least

166
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.250
David Schaich (he): for the case of the squarely. This is probably the easiest to think about.

167
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:19.720
David Schaich (he): If we have.

168
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.400
David Schaich (he): it has, it's

169
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.450
David Schaich (he): the nearest neighbors

170
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:31.460
David Schaich (he): you want all of those to be opposing. That's been so that there are a

171
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.530
David Schaich (he): There's a negative contribution to the there.

172
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.940
David Schaich (he): It's neighbors to the

173
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:54.720
David Schaich (he): and so on, so we can get sort of fully alternated.

174
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.720
David Schaich (he): Microstate

175
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:17.670
David Schaich (he): will be the ground stage. and and as before, if we imagine flipping every single one of these links, they will. It is a different configuration. A different microstate still have the same energy.

176
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.560
David Schaich (he): So this alternating pattern.

177
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.339
David Schaich (he): So this

178
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.800
David Schaich (he): again, is you don't need to generate

179
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:33.970
David Schaich (he): on it

180
00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.950
David Schaich (he): energy level with energy on this square last.

181
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:46.310
David Schaich (he): So there is a really good picture of

182
00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.090
David Schaich (he): what's your number?

183
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.660
David Schaich (he): All opposing links that we

184
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.150
David Schaich (he): and

185
00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.340
David Schaich (he): you can actually do the

186
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.340
David Schaich (he): same thing on the

187
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.550
David Schaich (he): This is an illustration of that where the colors are

188
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.140
David Schaich (he): visible, half of the

189
00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:29.730
David Schaich (he): signs are clear, purple and half your color green. You can consider the purple and green sites to have spins pointing up the down resp.,

190
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.210
David Schaich (he): so that there is

191
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.700
David Schaich (he): a negative contribution from

192
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:44.410
David Schaich (he): each of these links between perfectly green that lowers the energy. and it's checking that every single link in

193
00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.190
David Schaich (he): this configuration

194
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.420
David Schaich (he): is going to connect

195
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:55.000
David Schaich (he): such pairs of oppositely covered of sites or obviously pointing space.

196
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.330
David Schaich (he): you get that for

197
00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:02.950
David Schaich (he): partition of the system into is fully alternating ground, states

198
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.670
David Schaich (he): again, the 2 possibilities where it

199
00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.030
David Schaich (he): versus currently being spin down and green, spin up

200
00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:33.820
David Schaich (he): so the before Hold on. I was trying to let us. There is the question. How do we distinguish, or can we distinguish this

201
00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.010
David Schaich (he): problem. hey?

202
00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:42.830
David Schaich (he): Microstate, in the disordered phase of high temperature we used to be here

203
00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.880
David Schaich (he): can save this fully alternated. So is

204
00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:58.160
for her

205
00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:09.470
David Schaich (he): which. but it also seems from the I will on Wikipedia, where we grab that illustration of

206
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:21.280
David Schaich (he): what is the magnetization for these sorts of grounds on me. square or honeycomb lattice?

207
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:38.030
David Schaich (he): No, we can recall our definition of the

208
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:55.800
David Schaich (he): total number of students. and because we alternate between. convinced ourselves that there is an equal number of it.

209
00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:05.190
David Schaich (he): I'll put in the and give us the 0 just like you would have

210
00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.430
David Schaich (he): in that disorder phase.

211
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.420
David Schaich (he): Despite this.

212
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:19.070
David Schaich (he): just by visual inspection, we can

213
00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.270
David Schaich (he): say

214
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:26.490
David Schaich (he): that this is not a disorder phase. There is a clear pattern or a clear order

215
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.690
David Schaich (he): in how the spins are

216
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.460
David Schaich (he): distributed

217
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:35.770
David Schaich (he): along the to this lattice

218
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.270
David Schaich (he): there is

219
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:45.980
David Schaich (he): scratching it out across this whole structure.

220
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.930
David Schaich (he): So somehow we have to reconciled

221
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.350
David Schaich (he): the vanishing.

222
00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.640
My, if you associate with

223
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.770
David Schaich (he): in this order, configuration with the clear

224
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.530
David Schaich (he): order in the ground, state that we can see.

225
00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.570
David Schaich (he): And a way to do this with you by

226
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:21.010
David Schaich (he): it's 2,

227
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.020
David Schaich (he): the 5 8 you

228
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.990
David Schaich (he): order parameter that distinguishes between that disorder phase

229
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.740
David Schaich (he): and this.

230
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.760
David Schaich (he): and it.

231
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:42.610
David Schaich (he): The idea is, we want to take advantage of the regular pattern

232
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.570
David Schaich (he): of alternating

233
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.610
to do that by.

234
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.580
David Schaich (he): as we label each spin with some

235
00:22:54.660 --> 00:23:00.300
David Schaich (he): integer index in going from one up to the total number capital and of the spins.

236
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:07.160
David Schaich (he): Okay, mine is fine.

237
00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:16.780
David Schaich (he): So we well chosen labeling. They all the

238
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.700
David Schaich (he): they have a quick spins are placed on

239
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:25.500
David Schaich (he): lot of sites with an odd value for this index in

240
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:32.170
still over in

241
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:35.210
David Schaich (he): you. Look at it.

242
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.160
David Schaich (he): There you go.

243
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.930
David Schaich (he): one of the

244
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.230
David Schaich (he): that to be

245
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:48.090
David Schaich (he): what is what we call the standard.

246
00:23:52.960 --> 00:24:04.200
David Schaich (he): So it is almost identical to the magnetization just brings in this pattern of plus and minus one sign that we have chosen correspond to

247
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.540
David Schaich (he): in particular

248
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.130
David Schaich (he): lattice sites in such a way that's for this ground stays.

249
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.350
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

250
00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:26.260
David Schaich (he): it's maximum.

251
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:36.740
David Schaich (he): It's constructive emissions across all end of the sites that cancel out the whatever and energy. whereas in a

252
00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.550
David Schaich (he): random microstates of the disorder, things

253
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:47.430
David Schaich (he): expect i'll put it down with more experience to be randomly aligned.

254
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.910
David Schaich (he): I won't be even on site, so that this someone would continue to cancel out.

255
00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:59.250
David Schaich (he): We would be able to

256
00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.830
David Schaich (he): to distinguish the order ground space.

257
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.690
David Schaich (he): Probably this word phase, even

258
00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.120
David Schaich (he): in this anti-feromatic setting, with a negative

259
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:11.710
David Schaich (he): interaction

260
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:14.760
David Schaich (he): in this way

261
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:19.630
David Schaich (he): and one last

262
00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:25.270
David Schaich (he): coming I can make about this because I am going to take it longer than I expected.

263
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:33.090
David Schaich (he): I'll just these conceptual questions about interacting with the systems on various licenses.

264
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:39.970
David Schaich (he): I've called this over the parameter. But as we introduce the concept of order parameter in the lectures.

265
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.630
David Schaich (he): this is meant to be

266
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.880
David Schaich (he): related to a derivative of the free energy.

267
00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:46.740
David Schaich (he): It really

268
00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:47.760
what I mean.

269
00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.260
David Schaich (he): partition function, that the financial system.

270
00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:54.940
David Schaich (he): So. in order to use that terminology.

271
00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:00.260
David Schaich (he): make sure that the segregation

272
00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.640
David Schaich (he): can it be you connected to the.

273
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.230
David Schaich (he): There is a right to to do this with a

274
00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.560
David Schaich (he): for the

275
00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.130
David Schaich (he): system that we.

276
00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:24.220
David Schaich (he): How are we using this our basis? The partition function is the silver century

277
00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.900
to the exponential of

278
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.380
David Schaich (he): minus energy over temperature.

279
00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:32.560
David Schaich (he): our energy currently

280
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.060
David Schaich (he): yesterday nearest neighbor interactions.

281
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:43.480
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Well. we can do as a generalization is.

282
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.790
David Schaich (he): and to that interaction through

283
00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.910
David Schaich (he): a couple in between each of the spins, and

284
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.370
David Schaich (he): it's so called, staggered.

285
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.680
David Schaich (he): Yes. brings in the

286
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.640
David Schaich (he): that we want in order to get the

287
00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.530
David Schaich (he): standardization.

288
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:16.190
David Schaich (he): How is the derivative of the

289
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:25.660
David Schaich (he): with respect to this stagger magnetic field? It's not

290
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.940
David Schaich (he): i'm dropping.

291
00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:43.160
David Schaich (he): And then, in order to get back to the easy model

292
00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:44.890
David Schaich (he): that we used to.

293
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:54.090
David Schaich (he): We have taken the derivative to define this degradation.

294
00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:00.220
David Schaich (he): that external magnetic field set to 0

295
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:03.450
David Schaich (he): and get back to

296
00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.970
David Schaich (he): the system that we started off with.

297
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.850
David Schaich (he): So

298
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:20.550
David Schaich (he): that is. if they fung way to general wives quickly. The

299
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:32.030
David Schaich (he): stuff we've been building up in the lectures. It's we're looking at that, it using model simple, cubic lattices

300
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:37.130
David Schaich (he): just for the same color simplicity, working with the simplest possible

301
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.500
David Schaich (he): interacting with system you can imagine.

302
00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.560
David Schaich (he): Not just in the past

303
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.900
David Schaich (he): 20 min. We have quickly generalized this to

304
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:58.990
David Schaich (he): systems a couple of different line of structures.

305
00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.830
David Schaich (he): And seeing how we can define order parameters for

306
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.640
David Schaich (he): this interface.

307
00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:27.370
David Schaich (he): Yeah. One line of structure we haven't talked about

308
00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.970
David Schaich (he): with a negative interactions from J. Is that

309
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:36.960
David Schaich (he): last triangular lattice in 2 dimensions.

310
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:44.560
David Schaich (he): So you want all to share that with the ground States would look like in that case

311
00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.870
David Schaich (he): so

312
00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.190
David Schaich (he): certainly

313
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.530
David Schaich (he): new Page just repeating the same sort of argument that it was

314
00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:00.660
David Schaich (he): to maximize the number of opposing spins.

315
00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.380
David Schaich (he): Get at the ground state

316
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.910
David Schaich (he): on this

317
00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.120
David Schaich (he): I the lattice.

318
00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:22.370
David Schaich (he): So if we work it, just the basic

319
00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.810
David Schaich (he): you that sell

320
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:29.360
David Schaich (he): we space in a triangle.

321
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.710
David Schaich (he): replicates duplicate, copy, and paste

322
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:45.950
David Schaich (he): to go out to it full space to try and order that a structure. We have one of those sites

323
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:50.960
David Schaich (he): us neighbors.

324
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:53.300
David Schaich (he): and then we have

325
00:30:54.170 --> 00:31:03.740
David Schaich (he): a problem because we have imposed 2 down the port expense all these 2,

326
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:09.850
David Schaich (he): which that gives a positive addition to the energy

327
00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:10.960
David Schaich (he): rather than

328
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.680
David Schaich (he): negative energy contributions

329
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:20.000
David Schaich (he): get to that.

330
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.560
David Schaich (he): Okay. So another

331
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:29.800
David Schaich (he): more. Generally, this is the illustration of this basic dilemma there you

332
00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:44.540
David Schaich (he): article published about twenty- almost 20 years ago. If we fix a couple of of this basic.

333
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:52.630
David Schaich (he): then whatever option we choose for the third one. well face hey, you

334
00:31:54.620 --> 00:32:04.790
David Schaich (he): and if you increasing it a long interaction with one of his nearest neighbors. you can choose the upper. then these 2 lists.

335
00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:19.690
David Schaich (he): Similarly, if we

336
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.660
David Schaich (he): she's a

337
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.700
David Schaich (he): that would be happy

338
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:36.140
David Schaich (he): to.

339
00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.030
David Schaich (he): Okay, that's the energy

340
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.290
David Schaich (he): on that. So

341
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:48.210
David Schaich (he): what is going on in this case is that.

342
00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:53.770
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

343
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:58.750
David Schaich (he): given the lattice structure of this.

344
00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:00.910
David Schaich (he): you can't

345
00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:08.260
David Schaich (he): order all the spins into that fully alternating

346
00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:20.780
David Schaich (he): a lot of structure is simply okay.

347
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.810
David Schaich (he): And

348
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:29.460
David Schaich (he): what this is refer to as

349
00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:32.190
David Schaich (he): injector there.

350
00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:39.620
David Schaich (he): Yes. frustration all right. a frustrated

351
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:45.920
David Schaich (he): that wants to develop, that

352
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:55.040
David Schaich (he): we can only make some approximation to it.

353
00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.950
And

354
00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:02.950
David Schaich (he): well, formally this will arise.

355
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.210
David Schaich (he): or maybe my structure of that

356
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:12.250
David Schaich (he): it's not having a I apologize.

357
00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:20.010
David Schaich (he): and the that means is that

358
00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:24.880
David Schaich (he): it is possible to set up the line of structures, so that

359
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:31.820
David Schaich (he): the 2 sets of upward. And

360
00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:37.300
David Schaich (he): so every nearest neighbor. Okay, I believe you

361
00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:42.840
David Schaich (he): and vice versa, or

362
00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:52.120
David Schaich (he): every Us. Neighbor on every green site, is the appropriate site

363
00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:59.730
David Schaich (he): nearest neighbor Sites will be the same color.

364
00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:11.710
David Schaich (he): Let's see by partition it was to 6 of colors or spin orientations. and if we try to do that.

365
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.890
David Schaich (he): or you find the lattice.

366
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.470
David Schaich (he): Approximately, you're there.

367
00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.310
David Schaich (he): So this is an illustration of

368
00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:36.380
David Schaich (he): yeah, yeah. low energy state as a close and approximation as the smart one year was able to come up with many years ago.

369
00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:38.190
David Schaich (he): We can see that

370
00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:43.770
David Schaich (he): most of the Us. Neighbor hairs are

371
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:49.880
David Schaich (he): happy. alternating, plus and minus spins.

372
00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.330
David Schaich (he): but in every unit cell

373
00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:58.360
David Schaich (he): we have one hair out of

374
00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:05.510
David Schaich (he): to the energy.

375
00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:09.840
David Schaich (he): Sorry

376
00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:12.720
David Schaich (he): I read this up quickly.

377
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:27.070
David Schaich (he): It's for this single unit cell. There are 6 in generates spin configurations over microstates.

378
00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:34.930
David Schaich (he): Good job have that energy given by minus J. Times 2

379
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.640
David Schaich (he): opposing links, plus that third link being aligned

380
00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:41.580
David Schaich (he): so

381
00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:42.450
for

382
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.830
David Schaich (he): contribution. The energy that is just J.

383
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.870
David Schaich (he): That to be less than 0

384
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.480
David Schaich (he): when we generalize to

385
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:57.710
David Schaich (he): large number of spins into a large number of like so

386
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:03.960
David Schaich (he): 2 heavy links in the i'm happy one in each of these.

387
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:09.000
David Schaich (he): It's. Then there

388
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:14.140
David Schaich (he): we end up with your collaboration of

389
00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:20.770
David Schaich (he): Convince yourself that if you were to shift any one of

390
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:22.130
David Schaich (he): these rules

391
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.180
David Schaich (he): I would still maintain this pattern. Oh.

392
00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.510
David Schaich (he): on frustrated link in each trial

393
00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.470
David Schaich (he): there is a

394
00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.950
David Schaich (he): exponentially large number of configurations

395
00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:41.580
David Schaich (he): with that way

396
00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:45.440
David Schaich (he): which do not have any obvious way of distinguishing them

397
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.790
David Schaich (he): a random distribution of

398
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:59.420
David Schaich (he): on that by the structure. So in a unless there's no order for frustrated

399
00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.150
zoom.

400
00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.860
David Schaich (he): there's no order for ever.

401
00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:12.740
David Schaich (he): And with exponentially large number of

402
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:22.060
David Schaich (he): in the year log of that number

403
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:35.480
David Schaich (he): the I good computation of the entropy. It will be here. you know a positive number. even one of you.

404
00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:43.910
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

405
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:47.030
David Schaich (he): one of a small number of microstates.

406
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:50.420
David Schaich (he): and actually finding that

407
00:38:53.060 --> 00:39:02.300
David Schaich (he): that low energy configuration for a frustrated his zoom very hard.

408
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.970
David Schaich (he): computational challenge.

409
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:11.890
David Schaich (he): Yeah, the language of theoretical computer science. It's really to say.

410
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:13.240
David Schaich (he): No.

411
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.830
David Schaich (he): all right. Calculation and P. Hard.

412
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:34.310
David Schaich (he): We have a low energy. Given the configuration of searching through all the configurations of no obvious patterns, you will guide us

413
00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:40.620
David Schaich (he): computing resources at these classical computing.

414
00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.190
In fact, it was precisely

415
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:50.440
David Schaich (he): yeah particle from which I grab this figure in 2,004

416
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:53.900
David Schaich (he): that use the Np. Hardness of

417
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:57.110
to you.

418
00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:04.720
David Schaich (he): Really. Well, recent work. you know in quantum computers to this one the question

419
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:07.700
David Schaich (he): so

420
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:10.870
David Schaich (he): sorry to

421
00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.040
David Schaich (he): go on to.

422
00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:23.740
David Schaich (he): and your these sorts of fun phenomena that are coming out of. I usually tell them simple

423
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.190
David Schaich (he): interacting systems on fairly simple lattice structures.

424
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.720
David Schaich (he): dramatically. Behavior.

425
00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:34.800
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

426
00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:43.680
David Schaich (he): Technological application. The structure of the

427
00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:48.120
David Schaich (he): for the interaction that we have to to worry about.

428
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:54.150
David Schaich (he): Are there any questions before you spend the final time? Just looking at

429
00:40:56.470 --> 00:41:01.900
David Schaich (he): the plans for the exam in 2 weeks from tomorrow?

430
00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:13.420
David Schaich (he): It's not seeing any, I think. Keep this quick. I'll stop

431
00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:18.150
David Schaich (he): writing things on the projected notes, and just go through.

432
00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.910
David Schaich (he): Say, somebody

433
00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.450
David Schaich (he): things we can look at on the canvas site. Just talk through those

434
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:26.940
remaining few minutes.

435
00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:39.780
David Schaich (he): There are 3 exams up here with model solutions. I will actually look at any of those today. We'll look at any of the questions I've heard from some of you that you want to

436
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.520
David Schaich (he): practice with these exams under realistic conditions.

437
00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:58.000
David Schaich (he): coming a couple of weeks if you haven't done so already. But just from the first and last pages there are a couple of interesting things we can save about how the exam this year we'll compare.

438
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.780
David Schaich (he): So. as I mentioned in

439
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:08.270
David Schaich (he): our recent announcement, we have a 2 h in-person exam this year, scheduled for

440
00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:16.240
David Schaich (he): Friday afternoon, the 20 sixth of May in the electrical engineering building just across the University Square.

441
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:25.970
David Schaich (he): So it's a similar format to what was done last year 2022, the difference being that the

442
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:30.530
David Schaich (he): amount of time available it has double, which

443
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:39.600
David Schaich (he): should give you some of that more chance to write down more things about more of the questions.

444
00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.240
David Schaich (he): So, at least as a rough

445
00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:53.100
David Schaich (he): guide compared to the 2,022 exam. You can expect sort of overall enough to work to do to roughly double

446
00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:58.240
David Schaich (he): compared to last year's 1 h in person. Exam.

447
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.110
David Schaich (he): You will still have the

448
00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:04.300
David Schaich (he): a fairly standard formula sheets. So

449
00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:07.040
David Schaich (he): all the basic

450
00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:12.380
David Schaich (he): formula that appear here are things that you do not need to

451
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:24.860
David Schaich (he): memorize the central limit. Theorem is given, the entropy is given all of the definitions of partition, function, free energy. and the derived quantities for canonical and grand canonical ensembles

452
00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:34.220
David Schaich (he): are all there at the fingertips. The ready to do is to apply these formulas 2,

453
00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.950
David Schaich (he): the source of it

454
00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:46.510
David Schaich (he): systems and questions that we've been considering in tutorials, some works, and some of the in the lecture notes.

455
00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:53.180
David Schaich (he): The previous 2 year exams

456
00:43:54.130 --> 00:44:00.480
David Schaich (he): in 2020 and 21 were more affected by the pandemic. Those both turned into

457
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:14.690
David Schaich (he): good. Take home exams over 8 long period, so they are to some extent to less direct kind to what to expect this year. You will see.

458
00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:18.350
David Schaich (he): as you go through those questions on your own, that

459
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:20.230
David Schaich (he): they cover

460
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:26.950
David Schaich (he): in one way or another, essentially all of the topics that

461
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:38.370
David Schaich (he): have come up in this module bye zoom out to the full page. We have these and systems, each of our 10 units.

462
00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:41.920
David Schaich (he): each of which can be by some interesting things

463
00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:43.190
David Schaich (he): to look at.

464
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:47.510
David Schaich (he): So in the at first unit, where we introduce

465
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:51.140
David Schaich (he): capability, spaces, expectation values, variance.

466
00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:59.530
David Schaich (he): you spend a fair amount of time looking at things like random walks.

467
00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:03.030
David Schaich (he): Fusion arises from hey

468
00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:06.300
David Schaich (he): many repetitions of an underlying

469
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:12.980
David Schaich (he): elementary process which then generalized to the statistical of samples.

470
00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:17.100
David Schaich (he): Our underlying process is some particles that can adopt

471
00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:29.860
David Schaich (he): some set of also the microstates with some corresponding probability. So we get statistical ensembles as a realization of that more abstract probability space.

472
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:32.290
David Schaich (he): And

473
00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:43.740
David Schaich (he): looking first at this micro canonical ensemble, we are conservation of energy and particle number are imposed. and the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium

474
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:46.990
David Schaich (he): is derived from that second law of thermodynamics.

475
00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:55.620
David Schaich (he): The the entropy never decreases as time goes on, and it's physical on some of the samples, it's microstates.

476
00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:01.200
David Schaich (he): So equilibrium is the condition we are that entropy is maximized.

477
00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:07.520
David Schaich (he): We done further and generalize those concepts.

478
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:14.870
David Schaich (he): I'm, looking at the canonical ensemble by adding in a large thermal reservoir

479
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:21.210
David Schaich (he): which the system can exchange energy while keeping the temperature fixed.

480
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:27.310
David Schaich (he): And this is where we we're introduced to the partition function. The Boltzmann factor.

481
00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:33.810
David Schaich (he): How observable quantities, like entropy and internal energy, can be derived from the partition function.

482
00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:45.070
David Schaich (he): and how those are the role properties of systems depend on the information content. I'm looking at distinguishable versus indistinguishable.

483
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:50.910
David Schaich (he): And you guys, 4 and 5 are applications of that can

484
00:46:51.400 --> 00:47:00.140
David Schaich (he): to ideal gases. When we looked at mixing the mixing entropy, reversibility, and equations of states, the ideal as well

485
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.630
David Schaich (he): bring in the pressure.

486
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.560
David Schaich (he): Yes, a

487
00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:09.870
David Schaich (he): response to a change in the control parameter of the volume.

488
00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:15.070
David Schaich (he): and then putting those ideal gases into

489
00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:18.310
David Schaich (he): some containers and manipulating them, connects

490
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.040
David Schaich (he): that whole

491
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:32.040
David Schaich (he): foundation to these thermodynamic cycles. Specifically, we looked at key engines. The Carnot cycle and lectures, the auto cycle of the tutorial, the Diesel cycle

492
00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:37.980
David Schaich (he): in a homework really either move around to do work

493
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:40.860
David Schaich (he): and can define the efficiency

494
00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:42.960
David Schaich (he): of the work that we do

495
00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:53.060
David Schaich (he): and analyze both individual processes and those overall cycles in the form of the pressure building diagrams.

496
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:57.790
David Schaich (he): Finally, getting back to a third

497
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:09.540
David Schaich (he): statistical, also the grand Canonical One. where you generalize the thermal reservoir to a particle reservoir, both particle and and energy

498
00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.540
David Schaich (he): can change

499
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:21.420
David Schaich (he): the chemical. Potential. It's introduced as the additional quantity along with temperature that is kept fixed and alright.

500
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.420
David Schaich (he): quantum gases.

501
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:31.580
David Schaich (he): Yeah, so it it was like photons and fermions based on

502
00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:44.590
David Schaich (he): quantum statistics that we introduced as an all results. and showed how the Bose-einstein statistics of bosons. and the fairly direct statistics of fermions

503
00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:46.150
David Schaich (he): alright

504
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:51.550
David Schaich (he): determined by something over the differing occupation numbers, those types of particles

505
00:48:51.590 --> 00:49:05.130
David Schaich (he): going on energy level, why energy, level and approach in the high temperature, classical limits. The earlier classical approach to statistical, that we

506
00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:13.230
David Schaich (he): based on looking at a single particle, then generalizing it to many particles, and correcting for over-counting.

507
00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:20.290
David Schaich (he): And finally, what we've been doing in the past few weeks is introducing interactions to these systems.

508
00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:24.010
David Schaich (he): focusing on the using model in particular. Looking at

509
00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:27.470
David Schaich (he): these transitions or the parameters.

510
00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:32.840
David Schaich (he): the meat field approximation. Finally, on Monday. the

511
00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:44.630
David Schaich (he): numerical, important sampling to analyze these much more complicated systems that interactions produce. So what I just went through in

512
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:46.730
David Schaich (he): the past 10 min is

513
00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:56.230
David Schaich (he): sort of brief summary of that we have. And yeah. that's units. So just a couple of the pages summarizing all of the

514
00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:00.690
David Schaich (he): a recap of the topics of each of those

515
00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:03.370
David Schaich (he): you. That's so.

516
00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:09.100
David Schaich (he): in case I went through that too quickly, because we're running out of time for today.

517
00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:12.110
David Schaich (he): there's just a few paragraphs.

518
00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:19.390
David Schaich (he): hitting all of those key points which you can take a look at and decide if you want to

519
00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.590
David Schaich (he): follow any of the links back to

520
00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:25.950
David Schaich (he): the corresponding discussion.

521
00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:28.090
David Schaich (he): in case it didn't sound

522
00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:33.130
David Schaich (he): too familiar, or you're not to that confidence in your

523
00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:41.630
David Schaich (he): understanding of it for the exam. So that took us a minute over time for

524
00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:47.390
David Schaich (he): lining up outside. But I will check to see if there any questions about

525
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:50.690
David Schaich (he): that sort of review. You an excel plans

526
00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:59.640
David Schaich (he): it's 2021. That's one of those

527
00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:01.970
David Schaich (he): take home exams

528
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:05.070
David Schaich (he): done remotely. Access to

529
00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:08.220
David Schaich (he): the lecture knows

530
00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.410
David Schaich (he): and

531
00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:24.120
David Schaich (he): reading list. So yeah, see instructions on canvas. If I recall correctly for a few years ago. It was a time exam. even though it was done remotely

532
00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:27.260
David Schaich (he): with access to the lecture notes, and I think it was

533
00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:32.900
David Schaich (he): 2 h in total that included time to upload and stand solutions

534
00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:34.380
David Schaich (he): as well as

535
00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:37.130
David Schaich (he): actually do the

536
00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:40.320
David Schaich (he): any questions

537
00:51:51.450 --> 00:52:00.770
David Schaich (he): there will be slight differences. There are some things that you can recognize from that formula sheets. The partition function is not going to change from years to year.

538
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:14.610
David Schaich (he): But perhaps some of the yeah and it integrals that can be useful. Those might change depending on the question. So you can compare the formula sheets from these 3 past exams that look

539
00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:19.640
David Schaich (he): mostly similar, but not identical, and the 2023 formal. If she

540
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.710
David Schaich (he): that's where we follow that

541
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:29.290
David Schaich (he): all to

542
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:30.170
this

543
00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.360
David Schaich (he): yeah, so the

544
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:41.440
David Schaich (he): I would say both the they differ in terms of the scale of complexity of what you are

545
00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:51.320
David Schaich (he): asked to do. So the gaps in the lecture notes are sort of straightforward. and the tutorial activities

546
00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:56.740
David Schaich (he): can be larger scale, longer term things for you to work on. So an exam. Question

547
00:52:56.870 --> 00:53:05.750
David Schaich (he): 2 to the limited amount of time available. The questions on the exams are going to be easier than

548
00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:10.980
David Schaich (he): the whole works for the tutorial activities.

549
00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:18.150
David Schaich (he): It will be you up it less fill in the blank straightforward and the gaps.

550
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:23.670
David Schaich (he): So if you look at both of those, i'll get a good bracket on what is expected.

551
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:27.860
David Schaich (he): and I think that takes us to

552
00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:31.120
David Schaich (he): yeah, the end of our.

553
00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:34.930
David Schaich (he): It's like about the room. So

554
00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:41.110
David Schaich (he): i'll stop the recording shut down, and they see you Monday morning before

555
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:46.600
David Schaich (he): that, a final piece of luxuries I interacting systems.
