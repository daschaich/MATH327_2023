Hello, I am David Schaich, pronounced as in 'handshake',

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,340
despite how it is spelled.  I am a Lecturer in

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,800
theoretical physics and I'm looking forward to

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,920
looking into statistical physics with all of you.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,170
One thing I'll mention that interests me

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,160
about this topic is the concept of emergent

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,790
phenomena.  At the broadest level: large scale

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,260
behaviour that emerges from the dynamics of a large

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,660
number of underlying degrees of freedom that we

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,930
analyze with the tools and techniques of

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,500
statistical physics. Some examples of this that we

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,680
will see in the module are things like the laws of

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,850
thermodynamics, the ideal gas law, Planck's law --- but

14
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,360
this is a much broader concept that includes

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,560
things like superconductivity arising from an

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,670
electron gas in low-temperature materials; protons

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,780
and neutrons as emergent phenomena coming from

18
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,500
innumerable underlying quarks and gluons; or even

19
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,270
wormholes emerging from a statistical system --- which

20
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,990
was in the news just a couple of months ago.
