1
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:15.670
David Schaich (he): Okay, I think we can get underway.  Folks in the room already have the magic number for this afternoon on the board for those of you

2
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.810
David Schaich (he): connecting remotely, it is 1, 1

3
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.730
David Schaich (he): 5, 6, 0, 7.

4
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.730
David Schaich (he): And before

5
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.890
David Schaich (he): getting under way, let me

6
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.780
David Schaich (he): check to see if there are any questions about

7
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.740
David Schaich (he): the grand-canonical quantum gases that we wrapped up (at least for the time being) yesterday.

8
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.610
David Schaich (he): While you think about that,

9
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.460
David Schaich (he): I'll pick up with the plan for today, which is to

10
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.000
David Schaich (he): charge ahead with the final main topic of the module,

11
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.460
David Schaich (he): that we motivated

12
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.540
David Schaich (he): at the end of yesterday's lecture: Now adding interactions to the statistical systems under consideration,

13
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.660
David Schaich (he): which, on the one hand, makes everything much harder to analyze. On the other hand, it's necessary to

14
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.040
David Schaich (he): describe it.

15
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.670
David Schaich (he): Certain types of

16
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.960
David Schaich (he): physical phenomena, and particularly important

17
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.540
David Schaich (he): things like phase transitions that will be focused on today next week.

18
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.000
David Schaich (he): You know much of the remainder of this room

19
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.870
David Schaich (he): about seeing that

20
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.680
David Schaich (he): any questions about

21
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.670
David Schaich (he): the quantum gases at the moment.

22
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.590
David Schaich (he): Let's

23
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.100
David Schaich (he): say about these transitions in general, something that

24
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.750
David Schaich (he): the probably seen

25
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.770
David Schaich (he): all your times. not at the level of

26
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.460
David Schaich (he): that radical. You know

27
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.890
David Schaich (he): you've been here. Let's build up to that

28
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.310
David Schaich (he): gradually. My looking at the big picture first.

29
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.030
David Schaich (he): and you know why the space transitions are interesting in the context of statistical physics.

30
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.970
David Schaich (he): What they really amount to in the

31
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.190
David Schaich (he): the simplest way of putting it is that they are situations in which

32
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.770
David Schaich (he): the same set of underlying particles or degrees of freedom. or generally can be applied to

33
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.920
David Schaich (he): very different

34
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.650
David Schaich (he): long distance from macroscopic virgin behavior

35
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.500
David Schaich (he): to that theme of

36
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.760
David Schaich (he): large scale behavior, emerging from the behavior of

37
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:09.280
David Schaich (he): underlying microscopic degrees of freedom, has gone throughout this module. And now we are getting to situations where

38
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.900
David Schaich (he): the type of emergent behavior that results depends on

39
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.320
David Schaich (he): the affecting your particles. degrees of freedom under consideration, so forth.

40
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.220
David Schaich (he): The most familiar example of phase transitions are.

41
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.000
David Schaich (he): It was like

42
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.690
David Schaich (he): ice liquid water in.

43
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.010
David Schaich (he): Yeah, she's steam alright.

44
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.740
David Schaich (he): various spaces of each 2 little molecules.

45
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.430
David Schaich (he): the temperature and the pressure

46
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.200
David Schaich (he): at which those that collection of.

47
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.790
David Schaich (he): So the the liquid gas phase transition that occurs when you boil it with water. you have

48
00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:04.800
David Schaich (he): one of the molecules changing, for from the liquid water to gash esteemed. They are frozen into crystal in them

49
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.040
David Schaich (he): Lots of ice.

50
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.180
David Schaich (he): I get it.

51
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.560
David Schaich (he): Yeah. The different pressure depend controls and the temperature at which those different phase transitions

52
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:26.490
David Schaich (he): what changes between to the Okay? That's a very familiar

53
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.110
David Schaich (he): throughout physics, from everyday to the extreme.

54
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.940
David Schaich (he): and something more extreme that

55
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.740
David Schaich (he): I just mentioned here without going into the detail is a transition between

56
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:56.710
David Schaich (he): so atomic particles being bound into the nuclei of protons neutrons that we are all made out of

57
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.310
David Schaich (he): temperature. Oh, there

58
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.600
David Schaich (he): it's

59
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.580
David Schaich (he): they, this associated you can find, and turn it to a plasm up with their

60
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.040
David Schaich (he): It situates degrees of freedom

61
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.160
in particular.

62
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.400
David Schaich (he): the universe itself, in this

63
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:30.340
David Schaich (he): earliest fractions of a microsecond existed in the form of this very high temperature, apart from one by asthma, before most efficiently, for there to be a phase transition

64
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.290
David Schaich (he): oh, definitely. into nuclei, that we No, I love it when it's exist without.

65
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.680
David Schaich (he): And this early universe. previous transition has more recently been

66
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.440
David Schaich (he): recreated, and particle colliders

67
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.740
David Schaich (he): outside of Geneva, Switzerland. One of the

68
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.290
David Schaich (he): main aspects of the physics that he's being

69
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.670
David Schaich (he): to a calendar dollar.

70
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:10.620
David Schaich (he): It's your last example. That's maybe part way between you the extreme

71
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.220
David Schaich (he): you can think about

72
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:28.990
David Schaich (he): the movement of electrons in solid materials related slightly to the heat capacity that we're talking about tutorials. and one particularly

73
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.670
David Schaich (he): interesting phase transition that can occur.

74
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.360
David Schaich (he): and that we take to layers of

75
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.370
David Schaich (he): fascinating material called graph, which is a single sheet.

76
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:49.600
David Schaich (he): one at a thick of carbon atoms laid out in the hexagonal pattern.

77
00:06:49.670 --> 00:07:02.060
David Schaich (he): If we take 2 of those layers next to each other. and just their relative orientation, just slightly the behavior of the electrons in that material changes from

78
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:10.080
David Schaich (he): the insulating phase where no electrical current flows to it's super

79
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:25.140
David Schaich (he): where electrical currents now with the flows, I can flow without any resistance. There is no energy lost in the transmission electrical currents

80
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.050
David Schaich (he): which.

81
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:45.070
David Schaich (he): if that could be made to happen at the temperature, or whether revolutionized the electronics and the sustainability of energy production, consumption of transfer. In this case the graph in the

82
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.600
David Schaich (he): something that only happens for

83
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:58.590
David Schaich (he): fairly low temperatures less than 200 or so. So 270 degrees centigrade below 0, and

84
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.360
David Schaich (he): the picture here that it is a zoom out to. But it is showing

85
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:07.840
David Schaich (he): the kind of set I was trying to describe, which is easier to look at.

86
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.320
David Schaich (he): Just say it in words we are.

87
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.610
David Schaich (he): This is showing 2 layers of crafting

88
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.530
David Schaich (he): placed on top of each other top that are rotated by

89
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:30.100
David Schaich (he): this angle theta relative to the layer underneath. And hopefully the resolution of this projector.

90
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:34.419
David Schaich (he): They can help you. Hexagonal unit cells

91
00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:38.880
David Schaich (he): of the carbon atoms in each of these.

92
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.120
David Schaich (he): single out of thick layers. Oh, material!

93
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:49.420
David Schaich (he): And when this angle theta thanks. It's called magic values

94
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.630
1.1

95
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.930
David Schaich (he): degrees

96
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.620
David Schaich (he): the part of it

97
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.710
David Schaich (he): interference between these 2 sheets. This is the formation of

98
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.090
David Schaich (he): I love your super.

99
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.780
David Schaich (he): The

100
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.150
David Schaich (he): the same hexagonal shape.

101
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.030
David Schaich (he): smaller units. Yeah. compose it

102
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.860
David Schaich (he): on a much larger scale, going through all this material.

103
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.860
David Schaich (he): And to me that

104
00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:32.680
David Schaich (he): data to precisely that 1 point. One degrees is what produces this

105
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:47.810
David Schaich (he): phase. Transition from insulating material to super cloud activity. Add a fixed signature, or see as a useful I'm. Pressed to those other previous transitions we were talking about. For the temperature of the

106
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.370
David Schaich (he): it will be control parameters. Yes.

107
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.140
David Schaich (he): which would be possible. Large scale

108
00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.740
David Schaich (he): particles adopt.

109
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.330
David Schaich (he): So that is.

110
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.470
David Schaich (he): that's all I' about

111
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.700
David Schaich (he): big picture of these transitions.

112
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:18.330
David Schaich (he): We now you could get there mathematically. So we'll start from maybe the basic question for

113
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.100
David Schaich (he): interacting systems.

114
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.320
David Schaich (he): which is

115
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.840
David Schaich (he): what precisely and mathematically

116
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.690
David Schaich (he): do we need

117
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.710
David Schaich (he): describing system as being interacting with

118
00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:40.030
David Schaich (he): distinguishes between those 2 classes

119
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.490
David Schaich (he): our systems for us to consider.

120
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.500
David Schaich (he): So it's Google

121
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:53.060
David Schaich (he): Answer this question. Let's go back briefly.

122
00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:02.710
David Schaich (he): We call them all interacting systems that you did a lot with, and I also show up on that homework assignment due next week.

123
00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:05.740
David Schaich (he): So

124
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.760
David Schaich (he): these systems, the

125
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.150
David Schaich (he): energy microstate I was

126
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:26.260
David Schaich (he): the external magnetic field with the negative line multiply by the some of all the values of the spins from one to N. For the system

127
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.230
David Schaich (he): where

128
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:33.210
David Schaich (he): the values of the spins are set to be either plus or minus one.

129
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:39.370
David Schaich (he): depending on whether they don't line it with that external

130
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:50.260
David Schaich (he): pictures like this. Yeah. So set of spins pointing up or down. Yeah.

131
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.940
David Schaich (he): Oh.

132
00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:01.950
David Schaich (he): and if we fix these spins in a solid, so that they are distinguishable by your position.

133
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:07.290
David Schaich (he): and label them in s one through s 8 in this case, and save it

134
00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:14.540
David Schaich (he): that one in this spin configuration is equal to one estate

135
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.490
in the opposite direction, minus one

136
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:26.920
David Schaich (he): and just in general; for if the remainder of the module in this entirety. We will.

137
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:34.180
David Schaich (he): fixing all these spins in lattices of this source and that we are looking at the

138
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.400
David Schaich (he): tutorial with the I'm. Sorry.

139
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.800
David Schaich (he): awesome

140
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.840
David Schaich (he): the dimensions.

141
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.420
David Schaich (he): So all these things are distinguishable.

142
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.170
David Schaich (he): And

143
00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.520
David Schaich (he): yeah, in the physical world this d will be out there. One dimensional

144
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.170
David Schaich (he): What 2 or 3 mentions you control.

145
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.640
David Schaich (he): 2 national

146
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.700
David Schaich (he): in addition to left and right.

147
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.990
David Schaich (he): both below each other

148
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.000
David Schaich (he): again, with that same

149
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.730
David Schaich (he): external

150
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:33.430
David Schaich (he): label. the overall position both left, right and pop down. So

151
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.910
David Schaich (he): this guy here is actually a minus one. Spin.

152
00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.250
David Schaich (he): Yes, 3 3 is plus one.

153
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.950
David Schaich (he): and each microstate. Oh, yeah.

154
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.580
David Schaich (he): with this corresponding energy is.

155
00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:02.970
David Schaich (he): give them all you the configuration of all of these experience.

156
00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:06.500
David Schaich (he): So

157
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.610
David Schaich (he): see here in this world of the energy

158
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.800
David Schaich (he): is that

159
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:31.620
David Schaich (he): we can rewrite this kind of trivially. as you saw over in

160
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:35.860
David Schaich (he): some energies, Epsilon and we are. Each of those

161
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.670
David Schaich (he): is

162
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.000
David Schaich (he): the energy that corresponds to a single spin

163
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.540
David Schaich (he): in this system.

164
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.580
David Schaich (he): and

165
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.480
David Schaich (he): thanks to

166
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.590
David Schaich (he): factorization, we are also able to right

167
00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:04.960
David Schaich (he): efficient function for these sorts of systems in very simple. close form

168
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.780
David Schaich (he): expressions to the

169
00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:12.110
David Schaich (he): in part of the economical partition function. is

170
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:19.490
David Schaich (he): because the single-party competition function raised because power in this case, where the energy.

171
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.020
David Schaich (he): that magnetic field of times, the value of each spin computer

172
00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.980
David Schaich (he): several months ago, that it's just correspond to

173
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:36.710
David Schaich (he): cosine of the inverse temperature of times, that an angular field, all raised

174
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.260
David Schaich (he): to be no power.

175
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.060
David Schaich (he): and this factorization is going to be a

176
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:56.580
David Schaich (he): going to be associated with that interacting versus non interacting question that we get posed

177
00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:08.130
David Schaich (he): more sharply than the ability to express the energy is is similar individual contributions, which is something that might be possible even when

178
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.380
David Schaich (he): it's not to be interacting. Yes.

179
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:20.080
David Schaich (he): the following that formally a knowledge practical system.

180
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:32.120
David Schaich (he): How are you considering how this energy changes. If we change any one now

181
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.500
David Schaich (he): of the degrees of freedom

182
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:38.680
David Schaich (he): within the system. so

183
00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:42.660
David Schaich (he): change it

184
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.990
David Schaich (he): from making some alteration

185
00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.070
David Schaich (he): to

186
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.050
yeah, James particle

187
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:59.450
David Schaich (he): in the system. So

188
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.440
David Schaich (he): an arbitrary alteration will produce some generic change.

189
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:04.800
David Schaich (he): The energy

190
00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:09.380
David Schaich (he): system that we have is

191
00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:14.960
David Schaich (he): not interacting. if in who may

192
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.240
David Schaich (he): such the resulting change in the energy. Yeah.

193
00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:26.829
David Schaich (he): is, in all of those cases. independence.

194
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:32.760
David Schaich (he): all the other degrees of freedom to the particle step

195
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:46.910
David Schaich (he): you can label. Okay is not equal to J. The one that we alter it to produce this change. So do the quick safety check. Yes. non interact, and still system

196
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:52.180
David Schaich (he): they're talking about is interacting by this definition.

197
00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:02.560
David Schaich (he): So in this case, the only alteration that we can make to an arbitrary part of the system is to go

198
00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.350
David Schaich (he): flip it

199
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:11.460
David Schaich (he): so spin. Sj. i'll turn it. It's minus Sj.

200
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:23.060
David Schaich (he): And the energy we can break up some of all those particles to pick out contribution.

201
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.440
David Schaich (he): The script

202
00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.650
David Schaich (he): contribution.

203
00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:37.490
David Schaich (he): What's this overall other? Okay, it's not

204
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.000
David Schaich (he): just standing.

205
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.960
David Schaich (he): You just pick up that my assignment, the other part.

206
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:46.800
the whole story

207
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.370
David Schaich (he): UN effective.

208
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:53.840
David Schaich (he): and you find that

209
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.670
use the energy before and after a.

210
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.270
David Schaich (he): It's just twice

211
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.100
David Schaich (he): each times

212
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:15.920
David Schaich (he): initial. Oh, that's been J. This is

213
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.890
David Schaich (he): yeah.

214
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.190
David Schaich (he): as expected

215
00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:34.580
David Schaich (he): confirmation that our definition is a sensible one.

216
00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.030
David Schaich (he): and what we I've claimed all along with anonymous

217
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.510
David Schaich (he): on the

218
00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:50.190
David Schaich (he): i'm. Guessing there are not questions about that, but if there are feel free to.

219
00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.010
David Schaich (he): It's more interesting to

220
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:59.240
David Schaich (he): go on to something we haven't looked at yet.

221
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.430
David Schaich (he): So suppose we have

222
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.820
David Schaich (he): it's more. It is more interacting

223
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:10.920
David Schaich (he): interesting.

224
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.660
David Schaich (he): Let's continue considering

225
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:24.850
David Schaich (he): spins in. There you go the dimensional matters. I generalize the energy. Yeah.

226
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.080
David Schaich (he): Microstates to

227
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.830
David Schaich (he): global products.

228
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:37.960
David Schaich (he): 2 spins, Sj. And S. K. Over some pairs. Jk: in addition to

229
00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.070
David Schaich (he): just the interaction

230
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:52.450
David Schaich (he): with that external magnetic field H. That we started off with previously. where this notation of having a some. we did 2 in the series of parentheses underneath

231
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:56.380
David Schaich (he): it's referring in general terms to

232
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.300
David Schaich (he): all possible pairs.

233
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.410
David Schaich (he): I nearest neighbor spins.

234
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:12.940
and

235
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:17.060
David Schaich (he): for short, you know, as a structure, so we'll

236
00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.280
David Schaich (he): with your parents

237
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:24.490
David Schaich (he): in more detail, and depending on the dimensionality. And

238
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.110
David Schaich (he): just a few minutes

239
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.190
David Schaich (he): we can see already, from

240
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:35.190
David Schaich (he): what we draw up here that my nearest neighbor in one dimension is simply

241
00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.760
David Schaich (he): students that are next to each other

242
00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.440
David Schaich (he): 2 directions that can be

243
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.410
David Schaich (he): left, and

244
00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.800
David Schaich (he): but not the diagonals or further helps away.

245
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.270
David Schaich (he): so there will be

246
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:59.650
David Schaich (he): contribution to the energy of the system coming first from the year.

247
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.680
David Schaich (he): Magnetic field multiply

248
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:12.440
David Schaich (he): into the spins as well as from just the relative values of the spins themselves, whether as we go

249
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.980
David Schaich (he): but one to the next, they are pointing in the same direction, whether upward, down, or

250
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:17.860
you

251
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.410
David Schaich (he): opposite directions.

252
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:26.730
David Schaich (he): And again, the only possible to

253
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.260
David Schaich (he): in a system. With

254
00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:37.800
David Schaich (he): this sort of energy or Microsoft. the configuration of all of the spins is just to flip it.

255
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:52.890
David Schaich (he): In this case let me pull out the spin. Sj. expression for the energy that will be multiplying both.

256
00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.480
David Schaich (he): Oh, yeah.

257
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.910
David Schaich (he): all of its nearest neighborhoods so

258
00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:00.330
David Schaich (he): Sc.

259
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.500
David Schaich (he): Oh, hey!

260
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:12.080
David Schaich (he): That set of us may have repairs.

261
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.680
David Schaich (he): The other terms in that stone

262
00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.190
David Schaich (he): correspond to

263
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.060
David Schaich (he): the song over the spins.

264
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.960
David Schaich (he): The pairs of nearest neighbors that do not include J.

265
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:35.820
David Schaich (he): So J. Is not in the where we multiply it. the spins M. And K. Together.

266
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.030
David Schaich (he): and then the

267
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:50.490
David Schaich (he): the same one that we had before. That's what's the sell over of the K. That are different from J.

268
00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:08.140
David Schaich (he): Some over

269
00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:14.420
David Schaich (he): no change to it appears that do not include J.

270
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:20.260
David Schaich (he): And similarly within these.

271
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.500
David Schaich (he): in the

272
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.080
David Schaich (he): we're taking the difference.

273
00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.720
David Schaich (he): Those are the same cancel out as to those

274
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:34.380
David Schaich (he): you are. Yeah.

275
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.560
David Schaich (he): very simple expression.

276
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:50.720
David Schaich (he): It's that same 2 times the original value of the spin J with the inch. Now we the additional contribution.

277
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.990
David Schaich (he): All the nearest neighbor spins of J.

278
00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.830
David Schaich (he): So delta Ej.

279
00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:03.950
David Schaich (he): Now it depends

280
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.820
David Schaich (he): on sk 4,

281
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:24.890
David Schaich (he): and this is formally an interactive system. I just I like to 2 the interaction with the interaction terms

282
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.460
David Schaich (he): one

283
00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:32.940
David Schaich (he): absolutely.

284
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.290
David Schaich (he): This is the calculation that you may be wondering about is

285
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:42.400
David Schaich (he): what is the precise definition of the nearest neighbors that we have

286
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.240
to work with.

287
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:48.640
David Schaich (he): We've kept this sort of general. In in principle there are an infinite.

288
00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:57.430
David Schaich (he): a variety of distributions of the degrees of freedom in

289
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.820
David Schaich (he): these spin systems that

290
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:04.060
David Schaich (he): you could imagine that setting up and

291
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.600
David Schaich (he): using as a basis for analysis.

292
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.750
David Schaich (he): which I mean to say that precise 4

293
00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.520
David Schaich (he): of the nearest neighborors that are now contributing

294
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:21.820
David Schaich (he): to the energy to the partition function, and to all these large quantities

295
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.320
David Schaich (he): depends on the structure. All of that.

296
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.860
David Schaich (he): The lattice on which we

297
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.310
David Schaich (he): form with the system which we place the

298
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:42.430
David Schaich (he): that's the general statements, this expression, the function for

299
00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.080
David Schaich (he): the internal energy

300
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:50.240
David Schaich (he): configuration of spins along with the

301
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.530
David Schaich (he): that a structure that defines

302
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.910
David Schaich (he): the nearest name repairs

303
00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.810
David Schaich (he): go into that, or she

304
00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.260
David Schaich (he): together. Jealous the system.

305
00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.580
David Schaich (he): This is the easy model.

306
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:12.330
David Schaich (he): this whole easy model, because it was invented by

307
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.280
David Schaich (he): We'll have once just over a 100 years ago.

308
00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.390
David Schaich (he): Now. at least in this.

309
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.580
David Schaich (he): in the lectures we will

310
00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.340
David Schaich (he): consider only

311
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.070
David Schaich (he): cubic lattices in

312
00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:37.050
David Schaich (he): an arbitrary number of d dimensions.

313
00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.130
David Schaich (he): a few specific

314
00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:49.440
David Schaich (he): dimensional lattices that we drew earlier as well as a pretty much

315
00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.530
David Schaich (he): what you guys

316
00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.540
David Schaich (he): just to keep things.

317
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:58.250
David Schaich (he): I guess simply when we draw these lattices in

318
00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.540
David Schaich (he): discuss them.

319
00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.590
David Schaich (he): Well introduce a good terminology.

320
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:04.520
David Schaich (he): Yes.

321
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.380
David Schaich (he): sites of the lab is

322
00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.970
David Schaich (he): will be

323
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.120
David Schaich (he): where the spins are located.

324
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:29.920
David Schaich (he): We'll draw those just with nots rather than the up and down the recording arrows we used before. And then the link to the lattice correspond to.

325
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:42.250
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Here's the repairs that go into the definition of the energy 4. Each microstates you find 5 configuration.

326
00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.460
David Schaich (he): So this

327
00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:51.240
David Schaich (he): illustration of a pretty much in the lattice, just you only if it's into the

328
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.880
David Schaich (he): screen.

329
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.920
David Schaich (he): So here are the sites in black.

330
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:59.410
David Schaich (he): a few links in blue.

331
00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:05.810
David Schaich (he): pointing in each of the 3 basis, directions from left to right, up and down.

332
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.710
David Schaich (he): and then

333
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:11.050
forward and backwards into the out of the page.

334
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.050
The shading of

335
00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:22.060
David Schaich (he): links to showing up. Really. this direction will be my call. Is that direction. We have

336
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:27.260
David Schaich (he): x and y going left, right it up and down

337
00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:45.220
David Schaich (he): in addition to sites and links in a three-dimensional less, or even a 2 dimensional lattice. We can have these oriented faces that are known as cats. and in 3 or higher dimensions we can also have cubes as

338
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:53.010
David Schaich (he): the basic unit cell of the volume of it was your not going to be too relevant just for the easy model.

339
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.270
David Schaich (he): They're all

340
00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:01.720
David Schaich (he): a wide variety of lot of systems with different degrees of freedom and different

341
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.240
David Schaich (he): types of interaction contributing to the energy where

342
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:06.940
David Schaich (he): I kept saying, queues

343
00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:13.200
David Schaich (he): become a crucial to yeah

344
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.610
David Schaich (he): behavior of the system. And Even this basic definition.

345
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:23.160
David Schaich (he): and one other aspect of the last is that you might be wondering about is.

346
00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.930
David Schaich (he): how do we handle the

347
00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.320
David Schaich (he): edges of the system?

348
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:43.720
David Schaich (he): These to the side of the side. I have different patterns of nearest neighbors compared to all of the others in the middle.

349
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.750
David Schaich (he): All we'll actually do is avoid it. It was

350
00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.700
David Schaich (he): simplify so

351
00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.800
David Schaich (he): bye

352
00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:03.510
David Schaich (he): imposing what are called periodic boundary conditions

353
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:10.780
David Schaich (he): that wrap each into the lattice around, back to the other edge.

354
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:13.560
David Schaich (he): One name that.

355
00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:18.570
David Schaich (he): hey? You. of course. or

356
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.100
the general number of 2 dimensions, 8

357
00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:25.930
David Schaich (he): hyperturus. So this wrapped in

358
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.360
David Schaich (he): periodic boundary conditions.

359
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.470
David Schaich (he): he's called a PVC.

360
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:44.020
David Schaich (he): Going on. So the idea is that if we have

361
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:57.540
David Schaich (he): 4 us neighbor links in each X and Y plane of this axis. you imagine this.

362
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:04.470
David Schaich (he): So I draw here to circle back around to the right.

363
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.020
connect to

364
00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.560
David Schaich (he): that

365
00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.660
David Schaich (he): right most site in that hour later.

366
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:18.280
David Schaich (he): So those 2 links are, in fact, the same well

367
00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.060
down from the bottom.

368
00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:22.840
David Schaich (he): Yeah. back all around to the top.

369
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:30.800
David Schaich (he): The same sort of behavior that see you another video games like Pacman.

370
00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:36.660
David Schaich (he): If you go off one side of the screen you pop back up on the other side.

371
00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:41.220
David Schaich (he): and that just simplifies all set up. We are looking at here

372
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:54.020
David Schaich (he): because now there are to worry about can imagine cooling up this whole easier and more of 2 dimensions

373
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.790
David Schaich (he): for you.

374
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:58.770
David Schaich (he): Pull off the lattice into

375
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:01.870
for us.

376
00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.220
David Schaich (he): Okay.

377
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:08.960
David Schaich (he): system without any boundaries.

378
00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.590
David Schaich (he): and if no need to worry about them.

379
00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.210
David Schaich (he): different or special behavior that might come into play.

380
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:23.640
David Schaich (he): So all these two-dimensional forces are

381
00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:30.000
David Schaich (he): flat spaces in the sense of having

382
00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:36.430
David Schaich (he): 0. Gosh and curvature. Yeah, there is it constant distance between

383
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:39.950
David Schaich (he): all of the Us. Nav. Repairs?

384
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:41.590
David Schaich (he): You couldn't let me

385
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.700
David Schaich (he): all the links in the lattice

386
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:52.530
David Schaich (he): so many questions about the please you've been going through so far.

387
00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.740
David Schaich (he): not seeing any less. Look back at

388
00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:13.500
David Schaich (he): our expression for the energy we're doing this configuration. where we have now contributions from the end, spins couple of.

389
00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:19.510
David Schaich (he): as well as all of the links corresponding to the University of Repairs

390
00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:23.270
David Schaich (he): in the latest structure. So

391
00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:38.360
David Schaich (he): it is a question. What are the relative importances of those 2 terms which we can begin to answer by you doing it out? How many contributions are in each of those songs. How many links there are?

392
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.690
David Schaich (he): Google has site which will.

393
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.860
David Schaich (he): So if we just look at a one dimensional lab. there

394
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.080
David Schaich (he): sites are going left and right, and they wrap around

395
00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.380
David Schaich (he): at the end.

396
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:06.330
David Schaich (he): I'm doing this with 4 sites. You can count that there are all links between them

397
00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.820
David Schaich (he): no one at the end of going away.

398
00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:09.800
Let me see.

399
00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:10.760
David Schaich (he): cool

400
00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:16.650
David Schaich (he): and just in general. no matter how many you

401
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:21.190
David Schaich (he): sites we were to draw, we can see that each site is connected to you.

402
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:22.890
David Schaich (he): Those 2 links

403
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:28.320
David Schaich (he): 0 to us neighbors

404
00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:35.060
David Schaich (he): who site. and each of the links corresponding to those University of repairs

405
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:39.860
David Schaich (he): is share between

406
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.320
David Schaich (he): 2 sites.

407
00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.930
David Schaich (he): So there are 2 sites at the end of your link.

408
00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:47.050
David Schaich (he): So

409
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:55.920
David Schaich (he): those basic packs together we end up with the number of links. Yeah. 2 per site.

410
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:58.880
David Schaich (he): 2 sites

411
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.980
David Schaich (he): are here. and we follow that

412
00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:08.410
David Schaich (he): the number of links is equal to what that number of sites and just recounting with those 4.

413
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.720
David Schaich (he): It's equally easy to do this with accounting and

414
00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.410
David Schaich (he): 2 dimensions.

415
00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:17.680
David Schaich (he): There

416
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:27.120
David Schaich (he): the sites are good. How are you same distance?

417
00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.000
David Schaich (he): We pick out

418
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:37.050
David Schaich (he): that site at the center. You see it now. It has 4 links attached to it.

419
00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:39.010
David Schaich (he): one nearest neighbors

420
00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:45.760
David Schaich (he): again. Each of those links has these sites on each side

421
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:46.670
for wipes.

422
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.070
David Schaich (he): Okay.

423
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.130
David Schaich (he): I'll be the screen for you.

424
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:55.300
David Schaich (he): So those

425
00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.180
David Schaich (he): for the

426
00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:10.560
David Schaich (he): or divided by 2. So we end up with places my new links as sites. and the case of the 2 national lattice.

427
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.010
David Schaich (he): and this generalizes to what

428
00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:23.180
David Schaich (he): any higher number of dimensions which we may want to work. every new dimension will add a new direction.

429
00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:27.830
David Schaich (he): and for which each site will have a pair of nearest neighbors.

430
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:32.880
David Schaich (he): So

431
00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:39.480
David Schaich (he): I in general the dimensional hybrid you with lattice.

432
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.710
David Schaich (he): I don't see that

433
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.530
David Schaich (he): we will have

434
00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:55.150
David Schaich (he): to the times

435
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:59.100
David Schaich (he): in that links in total for insights

436
00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:02.890
David Schaich (he): all shared by 2 sites.

437
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:10.390
David Schaich (he): So the dimension of all the times. The number of sites gives us

438
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:17.910
David Schaich (he): number of links where I will trouble in order to keep the D. And here, so that it looks like a product

439
00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.180
David Schaich (he): rather than some differential factor.

440
00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.700
David Schaich (he): So, as the

441
00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.510
David Schaich (he): dimensionality of our system varies, you can expect this

442
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:36.920
David Schaich (he): interaction term all of those nearest neighbors to be called steadily more important compared to the

443
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.000
David Schaich (he): interaction with the external magnetic field that we are used to

444
00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.760
David Schaich (he): so

445
00:38:50.870 --> 00:39:01.850
David Schaich (he): previously, the so that we had a very simple expression; for you can particle canonical position function for

446
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:07.510
David Schaich (he): not interacting. It's been systems just and hours of that

447
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.290
David Schaich (he): hyperbolic cosine factor.

448
00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:24.160
David Schaich (he): And the question is. and we guess similar first one. I'll create an expression for do you

449
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:27.060
David Schaich (he): it all the corporation function?

450
00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:30.310
David Schaich (he): This is what we have to specify.

451
00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.870
David Schaich (he): It's like a structure.

452
00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.560
David Schaich (he): So the first of this is

453
00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:41.820
David Schaich (he): solving the system, letting down a close one expression for

454
00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:45.140
David Schaich (he): it's not like a partition function

455
00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.840
David Schaich (he): partition function there it depends on

456
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:12.160
David Schaich (he): They are the fixed number of particles in the external, that it's just the sum over all possible spin configurations of

457
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:16.250
David Schaich (he): the exponential factor of minus data, as far as the energy.

458
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.020
David Schaich (he): the that we have.

459
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:27.630
David Schaich (he): So we writing it. This here negative signs cancel out

460
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.080
David Schaich (he): times.

461
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.730
David Schaich (he): That's some of the

462
00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:41.550
David Schaich (he): must be at times the external field. Some of the individual spins.

463
00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:50.780
David Schaich (he): It's real. Call me for a second to

464
00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:56.160
David Schaich (he): appreciate the the task

465
00:40:56.430 --> 00:41:01.560
David Schaich (he): that correspond to actually solving this kind of like a proficient function

466
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:06.070
David Schaich (he): because we have interacting system.

467
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:12.700
David Schaich (he): Do not expect that to be this sort of factorization that just gave us

468
00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:20.670
David Schaich (he): in factors of the with all the cosine non interacting case. So what we have to worry about

469
00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:24.800
David Schaich (he): the sum over all possible spin configurations that we have.

470
00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:28.790
David Schaich (he): and particles, each of which can take 2 orientations.

471
00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:34.740
David Schaich (he): something like 2 to the end phones.

472
00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:44.130
David Schaich (he): and in each of those terms we have to, I consider the exponential after all it so. For these things there are

473
00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:48.370
David Schaich (he): in terms. You can just sell over all the spins.

474
00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:52.250
David Schaich (he): and we just counted the links and

475
00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:57.200
David Schaich (he): the d dimensional hyper cubic lattice that we're considering.

476
00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:59.100
David Schaich (he): Give us the time to

477
00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:01.270
David Schaich (he): problems

478
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:06.820
David Schaich (he): in the coming from the interactions in this exponentially.

479
00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:15.120
David Schaich (he): So there is overall an exponentially large number of terms

480
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.290
David Schaich (he): that in each of them.

481
00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:30.850
David Schaich (he): some over polynomial, large in your number of terms for and spins. And even once we get up to moderate values of the end, this will be a challenging.

482
00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:40.430
David Schaich (he): no quality to try to express. Yes, some simple algebraic function. So the

483
00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:45.470
David Schaich (he): basic answers, Can we solve the using model? Use? It depends

484
00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:47.630
David Schaich (he): in particular. It depends on

485
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.230
David Schaich (he): number of dimensions that we are working in

486
00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:58.200
David Schaich (he): so in that simplest one-dimensional case there he is an exact solution.

487
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.090
David Schaich (he): It was first computed by

488
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.530
David Schaich (he): that got his name attached to.

489
00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:18.640
David Schaich (he): and even though you've been assigned it as a Project by this a Phd Supervisor once that was back in 1924 and

490
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:26.400
David Schaich (he): brief supplemental section in lecture notes that goes through this exact solution, which we can do

491
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:29.400
David Schaich (he): if we have the time for it.

492
00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.360
In the remaining

493
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:33.960
David Schaich (he): weeks of the hello

494
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:42.090
David Schaich (he): things you more interesting once we have it more than one to.

495
00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:44.930
David Schaich (he): So the 2 dimensional case.

496
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:53.180
David Schaich (he): We have the next solution in the super my situation

497
00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.320
David Schaich (he): when there is no external magnetic field.

498
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:01.210
David Schaich (he): and

499
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.040
David Schaich (he): it took folks at 20 years

500
00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.540
David Schaich (he): on the time of

501
00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:15.990
David Schaich (he): Ph. D. Work to the solution of the 2D 0 people using model by a.

502
00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:22.780
David Schaich (he): With the Nobel Prize in chemistry in the twentieth century. and this

503
00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:33.510
David Schaich (he): his exact solution of the really the model of mathematical physics. If you were all interested in

504
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:40.010
David Schaich (he): it was complicated mathematically. You can imagine if we're looking at that up.

505
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:42.390
David Schaich (he): you know.

506
00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:49.320
David Schaich (he): starting with a computer article that can do a flavor or just how complicated the world to

507
00:44:50.750 --> 00:45:01.390
David Schaich (he): your way. Oh, that's the one the case that we could do something in this module to the too many days. that

508
00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:05.900
David Schaich (he): it's an honestly more after the mathematical sophistication.

509
00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.430
David Schaich (he): Perhaps not surprisingly for

510
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:12.700
David Schaich (he): the for 3 directions

511
00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:19.930
David Schaich (he): there remains to this day doing the exact solution.

512
00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:24.780
David Schaich (he): Any of those cases.

513
00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:38.470
David Schaich (he): What we do could also consider doing is rather the right now, and elegance I'll be ridiculous with the partition function

514
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:46.030
David Schaich (he): programming projects in this module and part because

515
00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.150
David Schaich (he): programming is so important

516
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:55.210
David Schaich (he): in many areas. But in particular a statistical business for interacting systems.

517
00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:57.590
David Schaich (he): If we would try to

518
00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:02.150
David Schaich (he): Google to try to numerically sold

519
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.220
David Schaich (he): this partition function just by computing every single term

520
00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.610
David Schaich (he): that she was in it. So

521
00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:17.380
David Schaich (he): what was that involved? If we consider

522
00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:21.350
David Schaich (he): very tiny case

523
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:24.730
David Schaich (he): a 10 by 10 last, and 2 dimensions.

524
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:30.000
David Schaich (he): so something not much larger than what we

525
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:33.970
David Schaich (he): through the few seconds of the side

526
00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:39.040
David Schaich (he): a few minutes ago. Then we have

527
00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:42.300
David Schaich (he): that total n equals 100

528
00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:47.000
David Schaich (he): and told them Returns To deal with is

529
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.260
David Schaich (he): 2 to the 100 spin configurations.

530
00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:53.290
David Schaich (he): each of which involves

531
00:46:53.460 --> 00:47:02.070
David Schaich (he): B equals 2 times, and so 200, plus 100, is 300 different terms to consider for each.

532
00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:05.410
David Schaich (he): to the harvesting configurations.

533
00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.590
David Schaich (he): and just looking at

534
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:16.350
David Schaich (he): between base 2 and base 10 gives us about 10 to the 3

535
00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:28.290
David Schaich (he): terms in this partition function for a tiny 10 by 10 that has some 2 dimensions. If we imagine our computer

536
00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:33.890
David Schaich (he): evaluate to a 1 billion of those terms per second.

537
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:39.660
David Schaich (he): That's the point operation per second.

538
00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:55.800
David Schaich (he): I have a 32. We get about 2 and 23 seconds to do that calculation just about 10 feet 15 years. which is about

539
00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.160
David Schaich (he): half a 1 billiontimes

540
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.580
David Schaich (he): longer than the age of the universe.

541
00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:11.010
David Schaich (he): So this sort of a free force, numerical solution is

542
00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:16.840
David Schaich (he): not a practical way to go, so we plan for

543
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:22.440
David Schaich (he): next week, and a week after that, given that, we'll be down to this

544
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:29.630
David Schaich (he): 1 h together. Give me a Bank Holiday first as

545
00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:44.530
David Schaich (he): high and low temperature minutes. Which Will you guys help us a lot? Not the system without doing it too much in the way of precise work?

546
00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:45.740
David Schaich (he): You can then

547
00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:49.370
David Schaich (he): go through a simple approximation which

548
00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.030
David Schaich (he): is easily solvable, but

549
00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:56.530
David Schaich (he): maybe not an accurate description of the floor

550
00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:58.560
David Schaich (he): Already I'll be using the call

551
00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:02.410
something known as the mean fuel approximation.

552
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.340
David Schaich (he): And then I believe there are

553
00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:08.840
David Schaich (he): smaller numerical approaches.

554
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.720
David Schaich (he): so it's my computational approach.

555
00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:20.580
David Schaich (he): You very

556
00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:26.870
David Schaich (he): valuable information out both the easy model in an arbitrary number of dimensions, as well as

557
00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:40.850
David Schaich (he): generally you more complicated interacting systems. That's the you plan. Going forward. You may last couple of questions about using model that we've seen so far

558
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:42.720
David Schaich (he): and

559
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:48.780
David Schaich (he): not seeing any, I will let you go and again enjoy another

560
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:50.440
David Schaich (he): sunny day.

561
00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:04.580
David Schaich (he): Yeah. connected to low temperature electron gases that we looked at yesterday.
