00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:07.680
David Schaich (he): Okay, we'll go ahead and get the recording underway for those who were able to

2
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.400
David Schaich (he): make it in person

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.560
David Schaich (he): here on the

4
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.200
David Schaich (he): snowiest day of the year so far. It's a Thursday morning,

5
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.340
David Schaich (he): the ninth of March, for

6
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.370
David Schaich (he): which I have 6-digit code:

7
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.270
David Schaich (he): 5, 7, 7, 7, 3, 7.

8
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.770
David Schaich (he): And, let's

9
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.850
David Schaich (he): see now, just wait a bit here for things to come into focus.

10
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.370
David Schaich (he): So, there are several things on the agenda today,

11
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:14.330
David Schaich (he): and, of course, as a tutorial, we are flexible if any of you want to ask any questions about any aspects of the module so far.

12
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.730
David Schaich (he): The computer projects marking should have been returned to you with feedback

13
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:35.740
David Schaich (he): yesterday. And there's a couple of quick things to say about that, followed by wrapping up the 2 activities

14
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:43.120
David Schaich (he): introduced last week --- the entropy bounds that we made use of on Monday,

15
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.660
David Schaich (he): and derivations of Stirling's formula at

16
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.110
David Schaich (he): various levels of accuracy.

17
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.390
David Schaich (he): Then we should introduce some new activity

18
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.250
David Schaich (he): for you to work on over the coming week, which

19
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.240
as promised on Tuesday will look

20
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.490
David Schaich (he): in a bit more detail at the mixing entropy and ensuring that the

21
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.770
David Schaich (he): second law of thermodynamics holds

22
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:28.500
David Schaich (he): in a simplified version of the thought experiment we went through in the lecture. Starting off with a computer project,

23
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.390
David Schaich (he): there were

24
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.460
David Schaich (he): quite a few excellent solutions there that we're essentially perfect. I met a few others that

25
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.440
David Schaich (he): struggle without any really

26
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.690
David Schaich (he): common issues, if things didn't go along for folks that tended to go on

27
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.610
David Schaich (he): all in different ways. But one.

28
00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:02.950
David Schaich (he): maybe 2 aspects of the computer project that may be worth mentioning is. first, that the solutions are on the canvas site, and it might be worth

29
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.510
David Schaich (he): looking through these if they

30
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.960
David Schaich (he): here to load. In this screen.

31
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.280
David Schaich (he): The Pdf.

32
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.130
David Schaich (he): Includes the Python code, which is also uploaded separately. or folks to download it.

33
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.340
David Schaich (he): And if

34
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.120
David Schaich (he): everything goes away.

35
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.260
David Schaich (he): what this provides, which might be interesting is sort of ball python code that

36
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.210
David Schaich (he): it's not very fancy it's python code goes. I sort of did the most simplest and straightforward thing, because I know

37
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:46.310
David Schaich (he): so much of an expert in python, at least, compared to some of you who were doing things in much more. By the way.

38
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.070
David Schaich (he): I did it make an effort to keep things

39
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.170
David Schaich (he): fairly compact and within, say a single page for each of the parts here

40
00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:03.880
David Schaich (he): by doing things like and say, exercise 3 B. Looping over the

41
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.870
David Schaich (he): numbers of repetitions that we have, rather than repeating this walk of code separately for each one. There's nothing

42
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.570
David Schaich (he): wrong with it that sort of repetition. What it does is

43
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.470
David Schaich (he): I have for you to go through more work, and also provide a few more opportunities for things to go wrong.

44
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.950
David Schaich (he): One other aspect of the computer project that may be worth touching on briefly. which

45
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.010
David Schaich (he): I uploaded some comments also on canvas

46
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.230
David Schaich (he): If they load. What's the

47
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.000
David Schaich (he): script in exercises 3 and 5

48
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.590
David Schaich (he): of using

49
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.750
David Schaich (he): correlated random walks. Hmm!

50
00:04:49.680 --> 00:05:01.440
David Schaich (he): Rather than going through and doing separate walks for each of the and steps that were requested. So in both exercises, 3 and 5, we wanted to look at

51
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.250
David Schaich (he): random walks of every single step for one up to 500, and there were 2 ways to do this.

52
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:18.600
David Schaich (he): One is suggested in the demo was just to generate 500 step walks and extract the first step or the first 2 steps of those as one or 2 step walks

53
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.940
David Schaich (he): that we're already lying around from the work being done for the maximum length.

54
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.650
David Schaich (he): The other way was the brute force approach of running everything independently

55
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:37.690
David Schaich (he): which those 2 setups produce. These 2 sets of results on the left and right.

56
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:48.270
David Schaich (he): and I think it was about half and half in terms of which students chose to make use of that suggested trick, and which just

57
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:55.900
David Schaich (he): could be more straightforward thing of independent calculations for every length of walk

58
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.500
David Schaich (he): and part of the motivation for doing things independently might have been concerns about

59
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.660
David Schaich (he): the correlations that resolve a result.

60
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:20.250
David Schaich (he): If walks out, we used in this sort of way. You can see that what things are we used. The points are much smoother, and, in fact, artificially smoother. They kind of hide

61
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.340
David Schaich (he): the random, his that

62
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.160
David Schaich (he): is there, coming from the underlying random number sampling

63
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.230
David Schaich (he): in that

64
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.940
David Schaich (he): full calculation

65
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.980
David Schaich (he): of what this comment is doing is showing that

66
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:44.230
David Schaich (he): the overall results in terms of the functional form proportional to the square root of N. As well as the particular constants.

67
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:55.740
David Schaich (he): the vanishing intercept. see, and this concept of proportion led about to be the same to several degrees. Several of significant figures.

68
00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.530
David Schaich (he): also in agreement with

69
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.580
David Schaich (he): the exact results in this case from the central limit theorem.

70
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:11.530
David Schaich (he): So the main difference ends up being that the trick speeds up the calculation by more than a 100 times

71
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.720
David Schaich (he): without significantly changing the results that are coming out.

72
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:28.010
David Schaich (he): I will say the changes look more significant for exercise. 5. The anomalous diffusion case where we are dealing with that Kosher Lorenz distribution. and as fatales that allow occasional

73
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.260
David Schaich (he): extreme fluctuations in the step size.

74
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.950
David Schaich (he): so especially with this large data.

75
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:42.920
David Schaich (he): 4.9. The independent points visually fluctuate a lot more than they do.

76
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.280
David Schaich (he): Let me just look at some sections of a single walk.

77
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:55.070
David Schaich (he): There's a much less fluctuation for smaller, theta because what this data is really doing.

78
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.310
David Schaich (he): and the calculations suppressing those

79
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:12.340
David Schaich (he): occasional big steps. But despite the difference in appearance between these 2 figures. note that the vertical axis increases by more than an order of magnitude.

80
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:24.250
David Schaich (he): The results of power. Law fits again come out to be the same to several significant figures, for the most part with a bit more sensitivity to fluctuations for that larger theta so

81
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.370
David Schaich (he): both approaches are in this case again with

82
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.799
David Schaich (he): a fast speed up from the trick which

83
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.280
David Schaich (he): but it kept you from having to wait too long for it. thanks to Ron.

84
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:46.020
David Schaich (he): So what could be interesting as Apollo to this is to actually estimate the uncertainties. obvious results

85
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.500
David Schaich (he): kind of beyond the scope of the project coming on here.

86
00:08:50.750 --> 00:09:02.420
David Schaich (he): But to see how many of these significant figures we can actually trust. I figure I can leave the solutions here for you to look through unless there are

87
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.760
David Schaich (he): questions about that.

88
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.130
David Schaich (he): Not hearing any immediately move on to

89
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.730
David Schaich (he): again going quickly through.

90
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.820
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

91
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.850
David Schaich (he): First couple of points on the plan for today

92
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.950
David Schaich (he): to you entropy bound activity that we looked at

93
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.340
David Schaich (he): last in last Week's tutorial we already discussed

94
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.360
David Schaich (he): in last week's tutorial again that this Pdf. Ever here is to.

95
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.510
David Schaich (he): She was face on the screen.

96
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.130
David Schaich (he): We went through just a few minutes. This case of

97
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.880
David Schaich (he): having 2 systems with 10 spins each. They fixed

98
00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:07.120
David Schaich (he): number of fixed total amounts of energy equals minus 10 units. That external magnetic field set to one. and found that

99
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:20.170
David Schaich (he): just looking at the single, most likely. and vision of those energies accounted for almost 90% of the total entropy

100
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:28.140
David Schaich (he): of those 2 systems after they are we separated in our heat exchange?

101
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:34.250
David Schaich (he): It's all experiment that is being redone to an extent in terms of the

102
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.040
David Schaich (he): particle, exchange, and mixing interview this week.

103
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.400
David Schaich (he): and what

104
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.800
David Schaich (he): becomes useful as the number of spins

105
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.880
David Schaich (he): increases. So recall that

106
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.230
David Schaich (he): in this the end of this activity.

107
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.280
David Schaich (he): after dealing with

108
00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:02.280
David Schaich (he): 10 spins in each of the 2 subsystems. The question was, how does this change?

109
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.900
David Schaich (he): As the system size increases.

110
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.550
David Schaich (he): based on the

111
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:21.940
David Schaich (he): rough illustration that we. to motivate these balance, we expect much tighter bounds as the number of degrees of freedom increases. And this is something that

112
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.160
David Schaich (he): it comes useful to

113
00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.220
David Schaich (he): automate, which

114
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:41.520
David Schaich (he): is done in the Python code that has been also uploaded to canvas. My experience can. This

115
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.970
David Schaich (he): does not play nicely with that code. It just has to be downloaded

116
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.260
David Schaich (he): and rerun that, or upload into

117
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.130
David Schaich (he): system like

118
00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.470
David Schaich (he): it's Google Collaboratory.

119
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.500
David Schaich (he): or I should be able to

120
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.620
David Schaich (he): one in. I remember it.

121
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.120
David Schaich (he): a password and

122
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.260
David Schaich (he): 2 step 2 factor authentication.

123
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.430
David Schaich (he): There is that. And

124
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.360
David Schaich (he): here are entropy bounds.

125
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.410
David Schaich (he): Zoom in a bit to make it more visible.

126
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.020
David Schaich (he): Essentially a simple python code. Now that you've

127
00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:03.130
David Schaich (he): gone through the exercise of that computer project where everyone did choose to use python rather than

128
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:14.240
David Schaich (he): things like that. Other solutions. We just have a simple for loop that goes through all the possible ways of distributing

129
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.850
David Schaich (he): a fixed total amount of energy between 2 subsystems.

130
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.860
David Schaich (he): You check all possible amounts of energy

131
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.780
David Schaich (he): in those 2 subsystems.

132
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.930
David Schaich (he): skip any division that

133
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:39.680
David Schaich (he): goes beyond the number of spins that are available. and then just compute using a scientific python routine

134
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.760
David Schaich (he): that gives us the binomial coefficients. She is the

135
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:56.120
David Schaich (he): multiplicity of each subsystem with a given amount of energy depending on the number of spins that it has.

136
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.910
David Schaich (he): We went through last week already.

137
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.870
David Schaich (he): Multiply those together.

138
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.420
David Schaich (he): And then, as we go through.

139
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:04.900
David Schaich (he): keep track. Of

140
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:07.850
David Schaich (he): which of these

141
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:14.730
David Schaich (he): contributions to that total energy is the largest, that maximum.

142
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.650
David Schaich (he): and compared the entropy coming from that

143
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:22.580
David Schaich (he): to the true entropy, along the total number of terms which we can

144
00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.680
David Schaich (he): also account, just using

145
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:37.200
David Schaich (he): some simple I utilities. So repeating, we're running this for and spin. Will repeats what we went through by hand last week.

146
00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.300
David Schaich (he): Once it connects and rooms.

147
00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:56.100
David Schaich (he): it is unhappy because

148
00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:10.700
David Schaich (he): it's a plus sign at the start. It ran in half a second to again. We reproduce just what we saw by hand. 5,400 is the largest term.

149
00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:23.100
David Schaich (he): The maximum is 15 and a half 1,000. And then do you largest single largest term accounts for 90% of the entropy. And it becomes easy to

150
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.290
David Schaich (he): we run this

151
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:38.030
David Schaich (he): with larger numbers of end. Where there are more ways of dividing the energy between the 2 systems, it can have. plus 80 units on one side, minus 90 on the other to get that

152
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.620
David Schaich (he): fixed minus 10.

153
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.320
David Schaich (he): No, I've heard it.

154
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:49.980
David Schaich (he): 96 terms in the full entropy, ending up to a total of about 10 to the power, 58

155
00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.610
David Schaich (he): of which the single most powerful division.

156
00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:07.710
David Schaich (he): right here, minus 4. On one side one is 6, on the other accounts for about 8 times 10 to the 57 of those or 98 of the entropy.

157
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:20.820
David Schaich (he): By the time we have 500 spin still enormously smaller than the and the power 23 degrees of freedom that come from oligarchs. Number. Well with him one of

158
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.530
David Schaich (he): that total entry.

159
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:36.690
David Schaich (he): a few play with this code. You will see that it those breakdown. Not for 500, but rather now 500, 20. Yeah.

160
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.370
David Schaich (he): We end up with infinities. And

161
00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:46.340
David Schaich (he): now the number results.

162
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:59.930
David Schaich (he): which is what that N. A n stands. For what's happening here is that the numbers become so large. We take the factorial of See

163
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:05.010
David Schaich (he): 156 factorial. No

164
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:18.530
David Schaich (he): giving up to Here we are. since we hit about 234 factorial that overflows the range of numbers that python is able to handle it.

165
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.740
David Schaich (he): 64 bit representation.

166
00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:29.570
David Schaich (he): at least out of the box in the simple way. and some fancier programming would have to be done to

167
00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.360
David Schaich (he): handle that.

168
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:45.920
David Schaich (he): And that is all I had planned to say about these interview bounds again, unless there are questions about them just wrapping up the stuff you've been able to play with

169
00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.310
David Schaich (he): over the past week.

170
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.700
David Schaich (he): In that hearing any questions I know

171
00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:10.460
David Schaich (he): again quickly move on to maybe the more substantial activity which were these 3 derivations of

172
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:18.300
David Schaich (he): Sterling's formula at a different levels, so

173
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:27.290
David Schaich (he): first quick checks that the logarithm of this n factorial was bounded by and log in on the one side

174
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.690
David Schaich (he): and log in minus N on the other.

175
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:41.350
David Schaich (he): So this is not quite establishing the leading terms of Sirlings formula. but at least

176
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:48.030
David Schaich (he): confirming that they are reasonable, and in that first term as an overestimate.

177
00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:53.610
David Schaich (he): and once that end is attracted, we get an underestimate. I see true value.

178
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.480
David Schaich (he): and

179
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:14.360
David Schaich (he): some comments in Python code. for these calculations have been uploaded, and I won't go through a detail or the balance which sort of one line calculations doing that in factorial is the product of N. Times n minus one times that minus 2, and so on.

180
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:20.180
David Schaich (he): So replacing those end terms all by end, gives us a larger number. That is just that to the Admin.

181
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:25.650
David Schaich (he): And similarly in the series, expansion for each of the power, and

182
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:34.840
David Schaich (he): there is one particular term. it has an end to the power, and divided by in vectorial. All the other terms are

183
00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.970
David Schaich (he): making a positive contribution to this series.

184
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:47.710
David Schaich (he): So we can just rearrange with that n factorial on the left E to the power and on the right. and we get the other bound

185
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.490
David Schaich (he): that the logarithm of n factorial is larger

186
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.400
David Schaich (he): in the log of them. Of this fraction.

187
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:01.850
David Schaich (he): The

188
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.370
David Schaich (he): second

189
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:09.880
David Schaich (he): derivation in

190
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.640
David Schaich (he): this main activity from last week is a

191
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.350
David Schaich (he): less trivial one.

192
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.390
David Schaich (he): which

193
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.870
David Schaich (he): maybe worth actually saying that

194
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.460
David Schaich (he): things about for more than a minute.

195
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:34.480
David Schaich (he): The first task was to relate in factorial to It's so called boy learning to roll

196
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.220
David Schaich (he): Basically, by.

197
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:45.220
David Schaich (he): Well, there are several ways of doing this because it's a fundamental mathematical relation that can be

198
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:50.250
David Schaich (he): determined in. anyway. Please.

199
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.460
David Schaich (he): Yeah. What I suggested was to

200
00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.920
David Schaich (he): look at derivatives

201
00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:02.710
David Schaich (he): of that integral one side

202
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:08.040
David Schaich (he): so minus a x, the

203
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.430
people to

204
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.920
David Schaich (he): one over a or a to the power minus one.

205
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:22.410
David Schaich (he): to take him a derivative with respect to a of both sides. that equality Bring down.

206
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.770
David Schaich (he): Okay, my, this X

207
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:40.620
David Schaich (he): one over a squared. taking another derivative of that over another effect, really minus X

208
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:46.270
David Schaich (he): on the left, minus signs. You cancel off on the left or right at each of these stages.

209
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:47.340
David Schaich (he): What it is

210
00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:54.280
David Schaich (he): 2 a. To the minus 3. The next to it gives 3 times 2 is 6, a. To the minus 4,

211
00:21:55.210 --> 00:22:04.620
David Schaich (he): and so on. where we get to. Yes. it's derivative on the left hand side we have.

212
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.750
David Schaich (he): and the factors of minus X

213
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.750
David Schaich (he): and with the exponential unaffected.

214
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.520
David Schaich (he): And then. yeah, minus one

215
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.230
David Schaich (he): to the end, chances on both sides

216
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:35.970
David Schaich (he): the n factorial from to you. one over a to the end, powers continuing to increase the final paid. the minus n plus one. which we can then set to a fixed value of one.

217
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.540
This expression

218
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.480
David Schaich (he): cancel all those

219
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:51.860
David Schaich (he): desire to E to the minus X is just separated

220
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.550
David Schaich (he): and factorial.

221
00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:10.730
David Schaich (he): Then the next step. this way of derived external formula was to see whether this integral could be approximated.

222
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.680
David Schaich (he): my Gaussian around its maximum value.

223
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.110
David Schaich (he): and it.

224
00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:26.360
David Schaich (he): I assume you had no difficulty, seeing that the maximum value is at X. Equals, N.

225
00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:32.490
David Schaich (he): It's reported derivative that we can go through if there are questions about it.

226
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.890
David Schaich (he): So

227
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:38.710
David Schaich (he): before it

228
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:45.600
David Schaich (he): going into detailed calculations of derivatives.

229
00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.370
David Schaich (he): I can head back to It's collaboratorial

230
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.270
David Schaich (he): here, and

231
00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:04.110
David Schaich (he): mentioned that there is again some Python code related to Sterling's formula on the canvas site.

232
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.640
David Schaich (he): This one and the first thing

233
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.390
David Schaich (he): that we do here

234
00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.820
David Schaich (he): is actually

235
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.100
David Schaich (he): compare the

236
00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:22.880
David Schaich (he): integrand of this integral, so X over

237
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.950
David Schaich (he): X to the power N. Times, E. To the minus x

238
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.840
David Schaich (he): normalized by that maximum value. When X equals N. This becomes end of the end

239
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.650
David Schaich (he): E to the minus. And so that's

240
00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.590
David Schaich (he): why some extra ends are showing up in the integrand here. So that is the

241
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:45.650
David Schaich (he): sell, a black curve. It's normalized to have a maximum, that one.

242
00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.180
David Schaich (he): and we are comparing that to

243
00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:49.150
David Schaich (he): the

244
00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.850
David Schaich (he): Gaussian, integral again, normalized.

245
00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.400
expanded in

246
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.480
David Schaich (he): that

247
00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:03.900
David Schaich (he): change, that different variable y be

248
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:11.870
David Schaich (he): distance from the maximum. So why is X minus N. That gets squared

249
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.910
David Schaich (he): divided by 2 n the blue dotted line is

250
00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.590
David Schaich (he): the Gaussian function around the maximum.

251
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:24.060
David Schaich (he): and we can see for n equals 100, that

252
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:28.020
David Schaich (he): this discussion is a pretty good approximation.

253
00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.890
David Schaich (he): with, in fact, barely any

254
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.320
David Schaich (he): difference being visible

255
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.640
David Schaich (he): as the

256
00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:41.660
peak goes down to 0. So this is an approximation that gets better as in increases.

257
00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:47.150
David Schaich (he): this integr becomes more sharply peaked around. This maximum X equals n

258
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:56.090
David Schaich (he): right there. So, dropping down to 10 degrees of freedom, you can see a bit clear discrepancies

259
00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:07.890
David Schaich (he): between the Gaussian I mean integrand of the order integral even more so if there's a single degree of freedom. Hmm.

260
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.860
David Schaich (he): Ends up being a fairly bad approximation. But

261
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:17.990
David Schaich (he): going out to I get the limit that we can handle without any of these

262
00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:32.430
David Schaich (he): powers. Or. yeah, the exponential and minus X will eventually overflow numerical precision you around a few 100

263
00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.920
David Schaich (he): we're in.

264
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:38.790
David Schaich (he): as we head up to sort of 10 to the power. 23

265
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.130
David Schaich (he): discussion

266
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:44.760
David Schaich (he): integral becomes a very good approximation.

267
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:48.930
David Schaich (he): So we then have it

268
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.730
David Schaich (he): from that. This relation

269
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.760
David Schaich (he): just

270
00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.400
David Schaich (he): swapping the 2 sides

271
00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:04.380
David Schaich (he): of the equation for the n factorial on the left

272
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:10.130
David Schaich (he): we have that it's equal to an integral over Y, now running from minus n

273
00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.630
David Schaich (he): to infinity

274
00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.340
David Schaich (he): of this combined exponential

275
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.210
David Schaich (he): function.

276
00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:27.570
David Schaich (he): minus Y squared over 2 n plus order of the Y over in

277
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:29.710
David Schaich (he): cute.

278
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.780
David Schaich (he): which we can break up into

279
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.380
David Schaich (he): the product of exponentials. Everything independent of why it's

280
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.470
David Schaich (he): pull out of that integral into the end.

281
00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:53.070
David Schaich (he): Y squared over 2, and plus that

282
00:27:54.990 --> 00:28:01.800
David Schaich (he): approximation that we have. it's given in the activity. Yeah, it is safe to

283
00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:05.540
David Schaich (he): extend a little range of integration all the way down to

284
00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:13.820
David Schaich (he): negative infinity. It gives an exponential, exponentially suppressed error. and gives us that

285
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.280
David Schaich (he): square root, 2 pi and

286
00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.530
David Schaich (he): e to the minus. And there is

287
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.000
David Schaich (he): the sort of leading logarithmic correction

288
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:29.530
David Schaich (he): to

289
00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.830
David Schaich (he): this expression through

290
00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.740
David Schaich (he): and minus N.

291
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.830
David Schaich (he): And then

292
00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:48.030
David Schaich (he): what's that going of a square root which is one half walk, 2 by end.

293
00:28:50.940 --> 00:29:01.490
David Schaich (he): And if we actually look at some of the numerical values that this approximation gives us for

294
00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:08.710
David Schaich (he): the logarithm of the factorial, that's the next cell

295
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:11.180
David Schaich (he): in this notebook that is

296
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:16.890
David Schaich (he): on canvas for you to look at. If you want to stop

297
00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.710
David Schaich (he): a few different ways of

298
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:25.560
David Schaich (he): directly computing the log of the factorial of admin

299
00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:31.600
David Schaich (he): compared to N. Log n minus n plus 4.5. So that's it.

300
00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:34.890
David Schaich (he): Square roots.

301
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.860
David Schaich (he): We can put in any number you care.

302
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.730
David Schaich (he): saying end of 10 and see that

303
00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:49.560
David Schaich (he): although that n log n minus n was about 14% off the true, the direct

304
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:52.900
David Schaich (he): log of them so 15 versus 13,

305
00:29:53.140 --> 00:30:01.110
David Schaich (he): adding that login term Already it's us to well within the per mill level, that one of the 1,000.

306
00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:05.750
David Schaich (he): So this is this little table for

307
00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.760
David Schaich (he): a few representative values

308
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.100
David Schaich (he): where the true

309
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:19.900
David Schaich (he): results for the logarithm is this last row. And see, there are some.

310
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.930
David Schaich (he): you know, 10% discrepancies

311
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.920
David Schaich (he): at and around 10 going down to 1% around any 100

312
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.140
David Schaich (he): that are almost all accounted for by

313
00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:36.500
David Schaich (he): the next to leaving correction. That more the root and

314
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:43.240
David Schaich (he): I get things both within a percent already for even 5 or 10. And

315
00:30:44.890 --> 00:31:01.370
David Schaich (he): and by the time and approaches a 100, basically the challenge is printing enough significant figures in this table to actually see. hey? Disagreement between these levels of approximation, though I may be

316
00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.090
David Schaich (he): getting it beyond myself, because there was that third

317
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:09.460
David Schaich (he): activity in of expressing here. It is

318
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:18.950
David Schaich (he): accounting for those corrections of extending

319
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:23.600
David Schaich (he): that lower limit of integration from minus n to minus infinity.

320
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:38.410
David Schaich (he): as those are exponentially suppressed. We expect they can be captured by a power series in one over N. The task, then, is to compute what are the unknown coefficients, a, B and C

321
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.870
David Schaich (he): that are showing up on

322
00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:46.180
David Schaich (he): as the coefficients of each of those terms to the order. And

323
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:52.270
David Schaich (he): in that expansion. and again.

324
00:31:53.540 --> 00:32:05.920
David Schaich (he): something where there are many ways of computing that just to quickly sketch out the trick suggested in the activity and quickly in case you have it.

325
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:11.250
David Schaich (he): problems with it. The idea was to use this sort of trivial

326
00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:20.990
David Schaich (he): identity that's in plus one factorial is just n plus one times in factory. All this gives us a

327
00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.830
David Schaich (he): recurrence relation.

328
00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:26.390
David Schaich (he): and it allows us to

329
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.440
David Schaich (he): log in

330
00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.330
David Schaich (he): the generic form of this expansion. Both sides

331
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:40.120
David Schaich (he): to pilot a plus one.

332
00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:49.400
David Schaich (he): I was the series expansion in terms of

333
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.100
David Schaich (he): n plus one

334
00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:01.940
David Schaich (he): whatever interest one hugely the right hand side. We have this.

335
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:09.720
David Schaich (he): you serious expansion. in fact.

336
00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:12.730
more familiar.

337
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.730
David Schaich (he): We're very importantly with

338
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:22.950
David Schaich (he): the same coefficients, a and B on both sides.

339
00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.780
David Schaich (he): and all we need to do now is

340
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:29.740
David Schaich (he): match the

341
00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.540
David Schaich (he): coefficients that up here

342
00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:39.440
David Schaich (he): we over and to some powerp terms

343
00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:42.870
David Schaich (he): on both sides.

344
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:46.990
David Schaich (he): So there's a few

345
00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:50.920
David Schaich (he): intermediate steps to get to there. Things like this.

346
00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:56.430
David Schaich (he): hey? Over n plus one. I need to be reorganized in terms of

347
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:06.190
David Schaich (he): inverse powers and into the P. Rather than and plus one of the P. Which we can do, using

348
00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:08.210
David Schaich (he): geometric series.

349
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:16.929
David Schaich (he): Very good. A over N. Minus a over N. Squared. That's an order one

350
00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:18.120
the queue.

351
00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:29.850
David Schaich (he): We also need to deal with these 2 pre factors. which, if we combined them all on to one side, all the one powers of the cancel

352
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:38.400
David Schaich (he): and the n plus one cancels the and plus one will be one power there. So we end up with

353
00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.590
David Schaich (he): hey? Yeah. square root of

354
00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:53.850
David Schaich (he): and plus one over N, which we can realize into one plus one over N. So we have that in the square root we have that with

355
00:34:55.969 --> 00:35:01.890
David Schaich (he): so. and then that one lasts. you know, for E.

356
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.570
David Schaich (he): And it is a

357
00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:10.700
David Schaich (he): fun exercise to similarly expand this in terms of

358
00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:19.910
David Schaich (he): a polynomial in one over N, which ends up being one.

359
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.790
David Schaich (he): this one over 12 and squared.

360
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.520
David Schaich (he): and in fact, the same

361
00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:43.970
David Schaich (he): approximations that give this also a way to. So It's a famous representation of this to see you limit of going to infinity.

362
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:50.930
David Schaich (he): that you know one plus whatever, and to the power, and it can already

363
00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:56.730
David Schaich (he): see that here we'll be in turn. It's one as it goes to infinity. All these corrections cancel off

364
00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.380
David Schaich (he): the plus a half becomes negative more compared to infinity.

365
00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.910
You basically just re-

366
00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:06.540
David Schaich (he): this result that you may well have seen.

367
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:08.740
David Schaich (he): So if we

368
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.990
David Schaich (he): match on these 2 sides

369
00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.590
David Schaich (he): terms that have one over into the power 0

370
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.420
4 to one terms.

371
00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.150
David Schaich (he): We end up with the condition

372
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:28.470
David Schaich (he): that one equals one which is true, but maybe not so interesting

373
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:32.260
David Schaich (he): one over in.

374
00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:38.640
David Schaich (he): and the

375
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:42.050
David Schaich (he): one over n square. Next to

376
00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:44.520
David Schaich (he): these expansions

377
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.450
David Schaich (he): that 1 12 There you are.

378
00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.460
David Schaich (he): possibly here.

379
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.320
David Schaich (he): minus a on one side, equals the other

380
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:57.800
David Schaich (he): for a

381
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.110
David Schaich (he): it's 1 12.

382
00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:02.270
The next room

383
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:05.110
David Schaich (he): correlation between a and B

384
00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.590
and plug. In

385
00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.930
David Schaich (he): the result we already have for a. and

386
00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:19.980
David Schaich (he): this sort of term, by term matching actually becomes something that

387
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:26.310
David Schaich (he): you can program with a bit of a effort. So I haven't attempted to do that.

388
00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:32.510
David Schaich (he): but it's possible using computers to

389
00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:36.460
David Schaich (he): computes just an arbitrary

390
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.190
David Schaich (he): number of terms in the series become one of the

391
00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:48.550
David Schaich (he): in this mathematical sequences. if it looked up. and the books and

392
00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:54.940
David Schaich (he): one last thing i'll say about Sterling's formula. One is to reiterate something I

393
00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:58.740
David Schaich (he): lost over quickly last week. For that.

394
00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.460
David Schaich (he): This series we have

395
00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.740
David Schaich (he): in terms of one over N. Is actually asymptotic.

396
00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:12.710
David Schaich (he): I think this is a footnote, so the radius of conversions is 0.

397
00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:17.730
David Schaich (he): If we try to include it, all of the infinite terms in this series.

398
00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.180
David Schaich (he): it will always diverge for any finite value of N.

399
00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.230
David Schaich (he): That's illustrated by

400
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.900
David Schaich (he): this figure, which is not coming out in

401
00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:44.420
David Schaich (he): very great focus. Taken from Wikipedia, showing the relative error in approximations to still things for me, a lot for a small value, and in 10 or 20 or 30,

402
00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:54.280
David Schaich (he): depending on the number of terms that are retained in this series. So we computed the first 2 just now a and B, and that to get up to 200,

403
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:58.640
David Schaich (he): and see that for these finite values.

404
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:01.570
David Schaich (he): and at some point.

405
00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:12.460
David Schaich (he): what's the number of too large? The error and the approximation actually stops improving

406
00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:29.530
David Schaich (he): actually here increases, and eventually how virtues you want. And, bill you time. There are 200 terms for a small. and as it increases

407
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.070
David Schaich (he): to you.

408
00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.110
David Schaich (he): point the number of terms where

409
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.800
David Schaich (he): the you approximation is

410
00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:47.140
David Schaich (he): optimized and the extension starts breaking down shifts off to larger and larger values.

411
00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:54.930
David Schaich (he): So what's said about? Certainly strongly large, or any questions about any of that toward

412
00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:59.220
David Schaich (he): intermediate step. Sign lost over kind of quickly

413
00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:07.240
David Schaich (he): What? To make sure that an activity for the next week

414
00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:10.840
David Schaich (he): is

415
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.730
David Schaich (he): introduced with some time, so you will just take a quick look at it

416
00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:15.930
David Schaich (he): today.

417
00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.890
David Schaich (he): So. moving on next

418
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:34.850
David Schaich (he): shut down Sterling's formula, and look at the next activity related to the mixing entropy.

419
00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:37.900
David Schaich (he): I did

420
00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:46.420
David Schaich (he): to have a paper and copy that.

421
00:40:53.800 --> 00:41:05.000
David Schaich (he): So we've talked about that mixing interview already, and the general case where we have either distinguishable or indistinguishable particles. We have that 3 stage process

422
00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:10.980
David Schaich (he): of initially having 2 canonical subsystems divided by a wall.

423
00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.720
David Schaich (he): So here that is this

424
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.420
David Schaich (he): dotted from dashed line.

425
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:24.810
David Schaich (he): What I should do is

426
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:32.690
David Schaich (he): 100.

427
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.150
David Schaich (he): Go ahead somewhere.

428
00:41:53.820 --> 00:42:02.090
David Schaich (he): Let's go back here. So we start off with those 2 divided systems. We combine them. We remove that wall, allow all to end particles to mix.

429
00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:09.720
David Schaich (he): and then we separate them. The argument we went through in lecture earlier this week is that we can expect.

430
00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:16.060
David Schaich (he): and even number of particles to end up on both sides of that wall. That's the lesson of the

431
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:28.940
David Schaich (he): and through the mountains activity. They went through over the past week. And now we look at a kind of intermediate case which simplifies the

432
00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:37.000
David Schaich (he): calculation where the mixing entropy was not 0, and things were a bit complicated. Instead of having all

433
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:50.930
David Schaich (he): to end of these particles be fully distinguishable. we put them. We classified them in 2 sets. so within each set. The particles are all identical and indistinguishable.

434
00:42:51.360 --> 00:43:04.220
David Schaich (he): but particles from one set can be distinguished from those from another. The other sets so one that is red. The other side is blue. and then we have initial and final states that look like this.

435
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:15.850
David Schaich (he): So you want to first compute the mixing entropy for this sort of intermediate case with 2 sets that are distinguishable, each with an indistinguishable particles.

436
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:29.410
David Schaich (he): and then actually compute the final entropy, and see whether the entropy continues to be non decreasing as we go through the 3 stages of this process. which is what the

437
00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:37.070
David Schaich (he): second all demands. So also recording. Stop talking for the few remaining minutes. and

438
00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:40.660
David Schaich (he): that you get started, at least for that first task.

439
00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.330
with the

440
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:43.780
David Schaich (he): second to

441
00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:48.380
David Schaich (he): go through over the coming week

442
00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:59.870
David Schaich (he): as usual. I talk too much, and only left you with a few minutes to explore that. But let's check in before

443
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:07.940
David Schaich (he): wrapping up for today to see if there are any immediate questions about this activity, for you, too. play with over the coming week.

444
00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.860
David Schaich (he): not seeing any.

445
00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:13.910
David Schaich (he): See you on Monday morning

446
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:19.840
David Schaich (he): we. i'll do what some of the classic results.

447
00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.610
