1
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.460
David Schaich (he): All right, according to my clock it's time to get going.  I see a bunch of folks connected remotely as well as those in the room.

2
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.170
David Schaich (he): We are back after the break, and in focus,

3
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.580
David Schaich (he): on the seventeenth of April, for which the magic number today is

4
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.400
David Schaich (he): 4, 9, 7, 4, 7, 2.

5
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.800
David Schaich (he): And before we get back underway with the final third of the module, I'll check to see if there are any

6
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.160
David Schaich (he): questions that have accumulated over the break in the past few weeks.

7
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.740
David Schaich (he): While you continue thinking about that, we'll do just

8
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.880
David Schaich (he): first a few logistical notes: that you may well have seen that the

9
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.550
David Schaich (he): last homework assignment is up on Canvas and due in

10
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.440
David Schaich (he): about 2 weeks on

11
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:14.860
David Schaich (he): Wednesday, the third of May, rather than the usual Tuesday, thanks to the bank holiday that week.  And then, a few weeks after that,

12
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.980
David Schaich (he): our exam has been scheduled for the afternoon

13
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.990
of Friday

14
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.900
David Schaich (he): the 26th

15
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.300
David Schaich (he): of March --- or of May.

16
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:40.130
David Schaich (he): We've jumped a few weeks ahead, making it May rather than March. And since we have jumped a few weeks ahead, it's worthwhile just to

17
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.750
David Schaich (he): remind ourselves of

18
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.870
David Schaich (he): big picture of this module what we've been doing

19
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.350
David Schaich (he): before the break, and what we still have left to do.

20
00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.270
David Schaich (he): We started off by finding so much all the way

21
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.810
David Schaich (he): sets of events which are themselves

22
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.440
David Schaich (he): sets of outcomes of possible experiments.

23
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.250
David Schaich (he): to each of which is associated with the

24
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.940
focus.

25
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.010
David Schaich (he): the specific

26
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.380
David Schaich (he): variety of the statistical ensembles.

27
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.830
David Schaich (he): We are.

28
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.510
David Schaich (he): The events that we have are some collection of degrees of freedom and particles that

29
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.600
David Schaich (he): Canada take up any one of the

30
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:54.600
David Schaich (he): by number, possibly infinite possibilities for how they are distributed in terms of position, momentum, energy, and so forth, subject to certain physical constraints.

31
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:07.380
David Schaich (he): zoom out just a bit more. Oh. have the comparison of the 3 years statistical ensemble we've

32
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:18.920
David Schaich (he): focus on in this module which differ by the constraints that they oppose. First, the micro canonical ensemble very directly imposes conservation of energy.

33
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.370
David Schaich (he): I'll call first of all thermodynamics

34
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.050
requiring that.

35
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.970
David Schaich (he): but the number of particles in the system, and the total energy of all those particles is fixed

36
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:36.340
David Schaich (he): as they all the time. It probably this requires that

37
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.650
David Schaich (he): the system be completely isolated from the rest of the universe, so that no particle for energy.

38
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.230
the exchange for anyone say, trying to

39
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.810
David Schaich (he): observe the system that makes it

40
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.510
David Schaich (he): a bit awkward to talk about the context of physics where you like to look at the things we're talking about.

41
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.790
David Schaich (he): and this makes the canonical ensemble some of more useful. We are.

42
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:10.660
David Schaich (he): The conservation of energy is the lax, and turned into the overall conservation of energy for the system, as well as its surroundings

43
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.700
David Schaich (he): and heat exchange at soft energy between system and surroundings is allowed.

44
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.579
David Schaich (he): Are we

45
00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:24.880
David Schaich (he): demand that the surroundings are sufficiently large, that they fix

46
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.920
David Schaich (he): the temperature

47
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.400
David Schaich (he): of the system to be

48
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:38.060
David Schaich (he): some constant value, even as the system evolves, and soft energy with the surroundings. What the number of particles is still fixed.

49
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.250
David Schaich (he): and finally going to be. we can see before the brief. We generalize this further. It's the Grand canonical ensemble

50
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.260
David Schaich (he): where we play that same sort of

51
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.210
David Schaich (he): trick. and have now both

52
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.450
David Schaich (he): particle and heat being exchanged with a

53
00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:07.230
David Schaich (he): large external particle reservoir that fixes the chemical potential new as well as the temperature of the system. even though the number of particles.

54
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.530
David Schaich (he): energy of those particles.

55
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.290
David Schaich (he): and very to exchange with the surroundings.

56
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.330
David Schaich (he): So

57
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.800
David Schaich (he): look at

58
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.220
David Schaich (he): micro canonical ensemble. Relatively, briefly.

59
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.920
David Schaich (he): applications to your gases

60
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.740
David Schaich (he): and thermodynamic cycles.

61
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.460
David Schaich (he): We will focus for next week or 2

62
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.680
David Schaich (he): the grand canonical case. and in particular

63
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.270
David Schaich (he): it there.

64
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.730
David Schaich (he): Our next the topic will be.

65
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.740
David Schaich (he): and for this week, and possibly next week, as well as going to be

66
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.510
David Schaich (he): applications of that.

67
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.780
David Schaich (he): looking specifically at something at

68
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.250
David Schaich (he): new compared to the ideal gases of a dynamic cycles that we've already dealt with.

69
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:45.360
David Schaich (he): Considering. Yeah. right quantum gases where the quantum here just means that these gases, the particles within them, and their statistics are covered by

70
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.970
David Schaich (he): the use of what's the mechanics that we have

71
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.300
David Schaich (he): introduced and derived just in the

72
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.140
David Schaich (he): last week before the term break.

73
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.970
David Schaich (he): So it's a reminder of this

74
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.960
David Schaich (he): quantum. Statistics are distinguished from classical statistics by the way in which

75
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.490
David Schaich (he): we define micro states.

76
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.030
David Schaich (he): Yes. heavy

77
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:19.140
David Schaich (he): probability of being adopted through the framework of this ensembles as capability spaces.

78
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.260
David Schaich (he): In the classical case

79
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:29.590
David Schaich (he): these microstates are defined by determining the partition function for a single particle.

80
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.840
David Schaich (he): replicating that for all of the end particles in the system. this needs to

81
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.200
David Schaich (he): some pathologies and certain machines where the effects of

82
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.660
become significant.

83
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.390
David Schaich (he): So we introduced

84
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.930
David Schaich (he): the alternative quantum approach. We're. Instead of looking at all of the

85
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:57.360
David Schaich (he): possible states of a single particle, with any value of single particle energy.

86
00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.470
David Schaich (he): We, instead look at

87
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.410
David Schaich (he): energy levels of the system

88
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.390
David Schaich (he): and

89
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:13.960
David Schaich (he): consider all the possible. We, as the particles can occupy those energy levels to specify about.

90
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.820
David Schaich (he): There you are

91
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:25.530
David Schaich (he): occupation numbers, where there are 2 main classes of on some statistics.

92
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:34.360
David Schaich (he): one related to those that are characterized by these occupation numbers, and so for energy level.

93
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.590
David Schaich (he): showing through

94
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:56.590
David Schaich (he): the calculation of the grand canonical partition function. In this case this is what's called those Einstein statistics. so that our economical petition function.

95
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:07.500
David Schaich (he): starting point, from which we can derive all the quantities of interest for the system it's. The project product over all the energy levels

96
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.630
David Schaich (he): of a factor, one

97
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:18.730
David Schaich (he): over one minus the exponential, the inverse temperature, the negative sign times, the difference between the

98
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:26.090
David Schaich (he): energy corresponding to that energy level and the chemical potential we heard. This

99
00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:34.490
David Schaich (he): arises from a geometric series that only converges if that chemical potential is less than all of the

100
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.910
David Schaich (he): energies for each energy level

101
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.720
David Schaich (he): and the other

102
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.430
David Schaich (he): other alternative, at least in that

103
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:59.580
David Schaich (he): more than 2 spatial dimensions it's. The only alternative is to have particles new as fermions that are characterized by occupation numbers.

104
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:06.590
David Schaich (he): the only possibilities being 0 or one an empty level or a field level.

105
00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:13.100
David Schaich (he): And the same calculation with energy levels restricted to 2.

106
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:25.120
David Schaich (he): Those 2 possibilities for fermions. You'll see if you can be direct for an economical partition function which

107
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:37.120
David Schaich (he): differs. One of those I assign that economical partition function by certain negative signs. First of all, you

108
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.080
David Schaich (he): the 2 terms that are multiplied together for each energy level are

109
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:51.100
David Schaich (he): the numerator rather than the nominator, and consider that a different sign of how they are raised to.

110
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:57.030
David Schaich (he): And then the relative negative sign. we, even the one that comes from the unoccupied levels.

111
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.760
the exponential factor that comes from the occupied levels.

112
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:10.390
David Schaich (he): And since there's no concerned about convergence of the geometric series here, there's no constraint on

113
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.760
David Schaich (he): relative size, the chemical potential

114
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.640
David Schaich (he): compared to any of those energies.

115
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:24.900
David Schaich (he): And in well, both of these cases there is a classical limit.

116
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.280
David Schaich (he): We're

117
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.210
David Schaich (he): the the po sign sign that

118
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:37.960
David Schaich (he): statistics, and from the direct statistics converge to what we would get from a classical calculation

119
00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:47.690
David Schaich (he): given the same energy levels, but analyzing them. based on single particle partition functions that gives us what's called the an actual postman

120
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.910
David Schaich (he): statistics, and

121
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.840
David Schaich (he): all 3 of those

122
00:11:53.840 --> 00:12:05.060
David Schaich (he): sets of statistics, the 2 quantum ones, and the classical statistics all agree with each other, and the high temperature limits.

123
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.730
David Schaich (he): So long as

124
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.240
David Schaich (he): the chemical potential

125
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.730
David Schaich (he): is a large

126
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.560
David Schaich (he): negative number.

127
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:33.160
David Schaich (he): specifically negative chemical potential. this to be much greater than the temperature, which itself is much greater than I do you energies for the energy levels.

128
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.860
David Schaich (he): So that's the

129
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:41.020
David Schaich (he): grand review of what we've done so far in this module with some extra focus on

130
00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.830
David Schaich (he): topic that we will he

131
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.150
David Schaich (he): building on today? I'll pause.

132
00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.040
David Schaich (he): I have to make sure that everyone is

133
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:53.370
David Schaich (he): happy with where we are. and how we got here.

134
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:11.170
David Schaich (he): Not hearing any objections. we can move on to

135
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.620
David Schaich (he): building up the

136
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.300
David Schaich (he): grand canonical analysis of pump and gases based on these pre economical partition functions.

137
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.620
David Schaich (he): There are

138
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:37.760
David Schaich (he): one main missing piece in the expressions here which will vary from a system system, and to find what we actually me when we look into

139
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:43.620
David Schaich (he): a physics analysis. choose what are the energy levels

140
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.780
David Schaich (he): so L

141
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.890
David Schaich (he): that get inserted into these current economical partition functions

142
00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:57.660
David Schaich (he): from which we derive all of you interesting aspects of our statistical system.

143
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.870
David Schaich (he): So

144
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:05.360
David Schaich (he): if we consider briefly

145
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:06.280
so.

146
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:21.320
David Schaich (he): the energy levels the corresponding values of the energy for them.

147
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.210
David Schaich (he): i'm not sure

148
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.020
David Schaich (he): which previous modules all of you have

149
00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.150
David Schaich (he): taken in in years past, you know, taking different sets.

150
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:45.140
David Schaich (he): So, at the risk of boarding you with a general review. We think about a single particle and relativistic mechanics.

151
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.590
David Schaich (he): It's energy. It's given by

152
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:55.410
David Schaich (he): the combination of mass, energy, and kinetic energy

153
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.410
David Schaich (he): we are.

154
00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.750
David Schaich (he): See, here is

155
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.450
David Schaich (he): the speed of light.

156
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.970
David Schaich (he): It's really just you the conversion factor that we could

157
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:19.740
David Schaich (he): set to one by working with appropriate sets of units. We've been in expressions for the sake of familiarity. Like the result, the equals Mc squared

158
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.590
David Schaich (he): or the mass under sheet.

159
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.510
David Schaich (he): This relation between the square energy, a single particle.

160
00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.330
David Schaich (he): and it's mass, and the

161
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.840
David Schaich (he): where It's P. Square is

162
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:48.800
David Schaich (he): the usual under products for all 3 components couple of months under the Xy and Z directions is our relations. Sometimes no one is. My son is trying to.

163
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:55.160
David Schaich (he): and C squared on one side of the right. you see on the other side.

164
00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:03.550
David Schaich (he): energy on that hypotenuse. It's square. It's just some of the squares, the other 2 size.

165
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.970
David Schaich (he): And then, considering the energies to

166
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.660
David Schaich (he): put into the

167
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.360
David Schaich (he): correct knowledge of partition function. it will generally

168
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.740
David Schaich (he): ignore that mass energy because it is

169
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:20.800
David Schaich (he): fixed for

170
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.620
David Schaich (he): given particle mass and focus instead

171
00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.540
David Schaich (he): on the kinetic energy that varies with the

172
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:36.120
David Schaich (he): momentum of that particle. We briefly look forward to

173
00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:37.870
David Schaich (he): the

174
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.970
David Schaich (he): 2 general limits of this. that we have

175
00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:55.950
David Schaich (he): a massless particle, or we're generally situation. It's much larger than it's mass times at speed of light and a conversion factor.

176
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.930
David Schaich (he): We have the we call for relativistic

177
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.630
David Schaich (he): energy, momentum relation. The energy is just

178
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.530
David Schaich (he): momentum. inner product times the speed of light.

179
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.339
David Schaich (he): and then the other extreme.

180
00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.740
David Schaich (he): so called, non relativistic limits.

181
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.260
David Schaich (he): The momentum

182
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.280
David Schaich (he): it's much larger than the mass times the speed of light

183
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.100
David Schaich (he): you should get back to.

184
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:42.070
David Schaich (he): and we hope to get back to the more familiar P. Squared over

185
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:49.110
David Schaich (he): to M. That we worked with in the context of classical, not an optimistic ideal. Yes, several years ago.

186
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:58.370
David Schaich (he): Take the square root of both sides of this expression and pull out an overall factor of Mc squared.

187
00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.100
David Schaich (he): We have

188
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.830
David Schaich (he): under the square root, then is one over

189
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.860
David Schaich (he): one plus PC. Squared over and C squared is square.

190
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:17.400
David Schaich (he): and in this limit that the I mentioned it's very small compared to the mass energy.

191
00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:19.510
David Schaich (he): and this is

192
00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.510
David Schaich (he): a small factor being added to one which we can expand.

193
00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.860
David Schaich (he): usual.

194
00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:29.830
plus

195
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:38.110
David Schaich (he): e squared 2 factors of the

196
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.070
M squared

197
00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:44.400
David Schaich (he): C squared

198
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.460
David Schaich (he): you next factor of P. Over

199
00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.840
with the fourth, and distributing that

200
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.880
David Schaich (he): Mc. Squared. This gives us the cost of mass energy that we can

201
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.070
David Schaich (he): plus the

202
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:14.550
David Schaich (he): p squared over 2 M. That we want to figure out is the more familiar non-relativistic kinetic energy

203
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.100
the corrections

204
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.580
David Schaich (he): before

205
00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.710
David Schaich (he): and C squared. Yeah, we can ignore.

206
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:31.500
David Schaich (he): So because yes. fixed mass energy is.

207
00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:41.000
David Schaich (he): they're relevant. You've already seen in the context of the classical canonical ensemble.

208
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.420
David Schaich (he): We dealt with ideal gases a few years ago

209
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.610
David Schaich (he): that

210
00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.950
David Schaich (he): it's not realistic minutes.

211
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:51.260
The usual

212
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:56.270
David Schaich (he): e squared over 2 N. Or the energy.

213
00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:58.360
David Schaich (he): and

214
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:12.080
David Schaich (he): in the context of awesome statistics we will repeat our earlier regularization. he's continuously, very energy and momentum.

215
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:22.790
David Schaich (he): You recall the least a message to a certain set up to

216
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.410
David Schaich (he): so units up there. The L.

217
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.060
David Schaich (he): Comes from the

218
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.730
David Schaich (he): steps to the volume

219
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:40.050
David Schaich (he): V equals L. Cube. within which our article is located.

220
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.910
David Schaich (he): You see a set of now you

221
00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:56.330
David Schaich (he): that determined the possible values of the momentum.

222
00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:03.090
David Schaich (he): And as we talked about this at the very end of the lecture before the term break

223
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.290
David Schaich (he): in the context, sorry

224
00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.030
David Schaich (he): autumn statistics, we have

225
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.760
David Schaich (he): the possible values of

226
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:17.900
this is

227
00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:28.220
David Schaich (he): this: is your case no longer include 0. They have to be strictly positive numbers. 50 positive integers.

228
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:33.450
David Schaich (he): and and go up arbitrarily high. This is

229
00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:39.660
David Schaich (he): we discussed you, too. Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation.

230
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:54.730
David Schaich (he): This change from allowing it to be 0 in the classical case to require it. No one's here. Okay automatically alters the

231
00:21:55.810 --> 00:22:04.540
David Schaich (he): gravity energy of the system as well as the multiplicity of the excited states that we have. We will.

232
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:15.370
David Schaich (he): We call them the degeneracies. So we call that if we have multiple distinct energy levels with the same value of the energy, those are known as degenerate energy levels.

233
00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.230
David Schaich (he): and they all have to be

234
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.410
David Schaich (he): taken into account in

235
00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:29.660
David Schaich (he): expressions for the grand Canonical partition function. Yes. is our starting point. And just for illustration

236
00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:40.850
David Schaich (he): often ground state with this new restriction that the K's. Have to be at least one

237
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.260
David Schaich (he): corresponds to a minimum.

238
00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.680
David Schaich (he): One units of momentum. That you should be

239
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.930
David Schaich (he): 3 directions should be

240
00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.920
David Schaich (he): what that into this non optimistic energy. Pretty good.

241
00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.700
David Schaich (he): The energy is 3 times

242
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:06.510
David Schaich (he): that overall

243
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:12.380
David Schaich (he): 5 square over 2 and L squared. I should. I've mentioned that that H. Bar is

244
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.450
David Schaich (he): the point, Constants, that we saw before

245
00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.660
David Schaich (he): again the conversion factor that we

246
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.520
David Schaich (he): could set to one by working with appropriate units. But

247
00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:34.210
David Schaich (he): you will keep around just to make things look more familiar, and make it easier to keep track of what to what quantities have, what units

248
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.640
David Schaich (he): we look similarly at the

249
00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:48.230
David Schaich (he): so called, excited States with larger values of this energy. Do you next one that we have, after the

250
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.620
David Schaich (he): 2 years of energy in one of the 3 directions

251
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.080
David Schaich (he): which one does it matter? But

252
00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.960
David Schaich (he): since each of these components gets squared

253
00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.640
David Schaich (he): no relativistically, we have 4 plus one plus one

254
00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:06.700
David Schaich (he): for 6 min of energy. In that case

255
00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.010
David Schaich (he): you can have

256
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.660
David Schaich (he): so 2, 2, one

257
00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.920
David Schaich (he): excuse. 4, 8, and 9,

258
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.340
David Schaich (he): 252 would give

259
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:25.820
David Schaich (he): 3 times 4 is 12, which is actually

260
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.210
David Schaich (he): a higher energy state than half for you

261
00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:34.080
David Schaich (he): 1 one. So 3, this of energy giving or bringing this to momentum, getting it

262
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:38.960
David Schaich (he): after 9 on the energy last morning that one

263
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.410
David Schaich (he): stop here. It's easy not to

264
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.240
David Schaich (he): you filling in this list of all of the excited state energies.

265
00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:52.240
David Schaich (he): real points out of that.

266
00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:57.740
David Schaich (he): Each of these 3 values of the energy

267
00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.590
David Schaich (he): correspond to

268
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:04.640
David Schaich (he): 3 possible momentum vectors.

269
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:10.950
David Schaich (he): On the first case 2 1 1 1 2, one and 1 1 2 3 possible ways

270
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.380
David Schaich (he): distributed. That was

271
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.900
David Schaich (he): different choices of a's and the 3

272
00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:24.380
David Schaich (he): directions. So each of those energies correspond to

273
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.890
David Schaich (he): 3 degenerate energy levels.

274
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.490
David Schaich (he): where, as the ground state. and this other

275
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:37.800
David Schaich (he): energy level with 2 units of momentum, and each of the 3 directions are the samely degenerate.

276
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:48.040
David Schaich (he): So that is a general review of the you

277
00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:57.330
David Schaich (he): limits of energies that we can have to insert into all right partition function over

278
00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:03.980
David Schaich (he): questions about those possibilities before we go on to choose one and charge ahead with

279
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.750
David Schaich (he): computing some physical qualities.

280
00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.560
David Schaich (he): Let's start with a

281
00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:27.200
David Schaich (he): 1 1 2, one. consider something different indeed. ideal gas. We look tips

282
00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:31.060
David Schaich (he): and the non volume to stick limits classically several weeks ago.

283
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.270
David Schaich (he): we will consider. possibly for the rest of the day.

284
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.950
David Schaich (he): a guess of

285
00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:54.360
David Schaich (he): Yes. these are

286
00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:57.740
David Schaich (he): those on the particles of light

287
00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:13.170
David Schaich (he): and the photon energy given by that exact. Now we're all to the 6 min. the energy of the photon. Is it so that sometimes you see the flight.

288
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.250
David Schaich (he): the momentum

289
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:18.370
David Schaich (he): in our usual

290
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:20.040
David Schaich (he): following

291
00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:29.310
David Schaich (he): we have H. Bar comes that factor of C, A single factor of Pi over L

292
00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:30.700
again.

293
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:40.800
David Schaich (he): K. The square root of the inner product of Kx, Ky. K. Z. That 3 components. It's a jury momentum. Vector

294
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:44.810
David Schaich (he): You may

295
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:51.790
David Schaich (he): have heard inform you that

296
00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.400
David Schaich (he): photons I've mentioned. They are particles of light.

297
00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.390
David Schaich (he): Light itself is an electromagnetic wave.

298
00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:02.260
David Schaich (he): so

299
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:09.220
David Schaich (he): they are

300
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.330
David Schaich (he): of those.

301
00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:15.560
please.

302
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.680
David Schaich (he): which suggests that we should be able to analyze their

303
00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:27.800
David Schaich (he): energies of momenta in terms of

304
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:34.890
David Schaich (he): properties of the slaves. Specifically. in my wavelength and frequency.

305
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:45.190
David Schaich (he): All right. The speed of those ways. It's the speed of light. Yeah, see. is the product

306
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.760
that we can see.

307
00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.960
David Schaich (he): So the way is.

308
00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:58.530
David Schaich (he): and

309
00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:03.540
David Schaich (he): this Omega. it's not to be confused with

310
00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:07.070
David Schaich (he): our labels for individual microstates.

311
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:07.960
David Schaich (he): Steven.

312
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:24.230
David Schaich (he): and the frequency of these waves given by 2 pi times the radial frequency in terms of Hertz. So you know cyclic frequency. So it's, counting the number of radians.

313
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.410
David Schaich (he): Yeah, it's it's traveled

314
00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:31.880
David Schaich (he): in a given amount of time as opposed to the number of cycles around that

315
00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.020
too high.

316
00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.090
David Schaich (he): and i'll put up here.

317
00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:47.360
David Schaich (he): clarify some of these quantities if they are not familiar. Just a second. Make the point before I do so. That

318
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:49.780
David Schaich (he): imposing

319
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:57.380
David Schaich (he): in which our photon gas is sitting this

320
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.540
David Schaich (he): the momentum of those flights. But equivalently you

321
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.590
David Schaich (he): frequency. and

322
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.150
David Schaich (he): through this connection to the speed of light.

323
00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.510
David Schaich (he): So I zoom out

324
00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:23.530
David Schaich (he): enough to fit this diagram into the screen.

325
00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:32.640
David Schaich (he): Looking at just one direction of alright, how are you? We have a factor of 3 spatial directions.

326
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:38.330
David Schaich (he): If we want to consistently have a wave

327
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.350
David Schaich (he): that is standing inside of this volume.

328
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.300
David Schaich (he): They're all restrictions on

329
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:45.020
yeah

330
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.540
David Schaich (he): possible wavelengths

331
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:49.010
David Schaich (he): that it can have. So we, we.

332
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.860
David Schaich (he): I will remind you, is the point at which

333
00:30:54.530 --> 00:31:00.530
David Schaich (he): distance it takes for a way to start repeating It's

334
00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.920
David Schaich (he): oscillation.

335
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.780
David Schaich (he): So this way

336
00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.040
David Schaich (he): as we go in space

337
00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.070
David Schaich (he): it was up and down it was up again.

338
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:13.030
David Schaich (he): So do you. What are you flying?

339
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:18.560
David Schaich (he): Here is the distance it takes to go that whole cycle and get back to

340
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.020
David Schaich (he): that's starting point.

341
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:25.060
David Schaich (he): So that is a full wavelength L 2 which

342
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.370
David Schaich (he): you cancel out the tues. There is just L

343
00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:36.150
David Schaich (he): down here at the longest possible wavelength that you can have in this direction

344
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:41.320
David Schaich (he): with like L. We go over only half of the cycle. So this is

345
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:54.060
David Schaich (he): one over 2. It is cool that it's identified with the same relation that we have off to the side. And then all integer multiples of

346
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:55.740
Hey you!

347
00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:01.180
David Schaich (he): What you find over to has to be equal to outward.

348
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.430
So it's a

349
00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:06.490
David Schaich (he): mathematical terms.

350
00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.490
David Schaich (he): We save that K.

351
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.710
David Schaich (he): In this direction.

352
00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:20.210
David Schaich (he): Call that direction X. It's just one direction

353
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:23.300
David Schaich (he): has to be equal to

354
00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:32.820
David Schaich (he): the length album divided by the wavelength half the way of life. Land over to we can rearrange

355
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:35.560
David Schaich (he): to say that the

356
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.980
David Schaich (he): only allow the wavelengths are

357
00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:44.940
David Schaich (he): 2 L. Over that corresponding integer starting from

358
00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:51.900
David Schaich (he): from there. So we producing the 3 cases illustrated here.

359
00:32:52.970 --> 00:33:03.900
David Schaich (he): Now the corresponding frequencies that we have given that substitute quantize wavelength

360
00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:15.880
David Schaich (he): all right by it the speed of light. So the frequency in terms of

361
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.520
David Schaich (he): 2 pi times the speed of light over Lambda

362
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:31.530
David Schaich (he): much plugging in. There is 2 l over that. Hey? X. We have a after C left over this huge cancel. There's a.

363
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.880
David Schaich (he): and there you go. Yeah.

364
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.130
David Schaich (he): Positive integer case of X,

365
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:46.930
David Schaich (he): which we can recognize as just

366
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.080
David Schaich (he): a constant factor times the moment that we have

367
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.490
David Schaich (he): in that one direction. So we have a C. Second H. Bar

368
00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.710
David Schaich (he): that piece of X.

369
00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.240
David Schaich (he): And if we rearrange this expression, then we have

370
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.480
David Schaich (he): P. Times, C. Is H. Bar times omega Times, c. Of course, is

371
00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:14.690
David Schaich (he): that's goes on energy

372
00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:20.139
David Schaich (he): express that completely in terms of the frequency

373
00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:22.920
David Schaich (he): of the photon, treating it as

374
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.370
David Schaich (he): a

375
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:28.960
David Schaich (he): and precisely quote ones to.

376
00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:36.280
David Schaich (he): So that is actually a result that we

377
00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:44.780
David Schaich (he): derived just before the break quickly and not quite so carefully. No seeing it again

378
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:46.620
more

379
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:54.719
David Schaich (he): through a derivation. And this is an illustration of this relation between

380
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.160
David Schaich (he): energy

381
00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.030
David Schaich (he): with that Briefly. before the break

382
00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:08.760
David Schaich (he): here. This weekly line up here is sketching out the

383
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.390
David Schaich (he): the wave length of the course, all in 2

384
00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.980
David Schaich (he): various distance, frequency, or energy scales.

385
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:19.320
David Schaich (he): So

386
00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:23.200
David Schaich (he): when the wavelength is long, there is a large distance before

387
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.770
David Schaich (he): that way, it begins

388
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:25.880
so

389
00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:32.030
David Schaich (he): kilometers or millimeters

390
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.780
to microwave

391
00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:46.910
David Schaich (he): that corresponds to a it's your express in terms of hert or cycles per second. In this case. however, it's corresponding to

392
00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.240
David Schaich (he): kilometer wavelengths.

393
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.360
David Schaich (he): and energies that correspond to

394
00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:58.270
David Schaich (he): fairly low temperatures of the radio signal, much less than

395
00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:03.000
David Schaich (he): a single Kelvin. A nice 272

396
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.540
David Schaich (he): we centigrade

397
00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.040
David Schaich (he): I would use

398
00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:14.180
David Schaich (he): to be more relevant to us in our day to day? Or is the spectrum of visible light that corresponds to

399
00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:21.590
David Schaich (he): wavelengths of several 100 nanometers? So some fraction of

400
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.140
David Schaich (he): it might come here.

401
00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:31.390
David Schaich (he): This is the relatively small. I said, the All to

402
00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:40.930
David Schaich (he): process as colors ranging from red. Yes. low frequencies up to blue and violence at high frequencies.

403
00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:51.300
David Schaich (he): If you go slightly more. then the bread frequency that's referred to as infrared, which corresponds to

404
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:53.240
David Schaich (he): and

405
00:36:56.590 --> 00:37:02.970
David Schaich (he): lower frequencies and over energies, and all the temperatures I will be referring to, infrared as

406
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:06.930
David Schaich (he): lower energies in general, not restricted to

407
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:18.790
David Schaich (he): this specific range of microwave and similarly ultraviolet. high energies. short made lines or high frequencies.

408
00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.240
David Schaich (he): as well as high energies and

409
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:25.630
David Schaich (he): high temperatures. So that

410
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:32.360
David Schaich (he): is a bit of visualization that we could have for

411
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.660
David Schaich (he): what these frequencies and what you want to respond to, as well as that terminology, you know.

412
00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:43.590
David Schaich (he): infrared referring to low energies. ultraviolet referring to bye.

413
00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:51.040
David Schaich (he): we have some time left before the very close to check. If there are questions about

414
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:54.080
David Schaich (he): this connection between

415
00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.130
David Schaich (he): momenta frequency and wavelength for photons.

416
00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.590
David Schaich (he): and if they are not to start setting up the

417
00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:16.490
David Schaich (he): calculation throw dynamics and equation of states of the photon gas.

418
00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:29.750
David Schaich (he): So we mentioned that photons are bosons.

419
00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:31.590
David Schaich (he): So what could be

420
00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.120
David Schaich (he): pre-economical potential that

421
00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.440
David Schaich (he): to consider for them, and into which we

422
00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:43.650
David Schaich (he): inserts

423
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:45.590
expression for

424
00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:53.680
David Schaich (he): the energies of photons. even discreet quantized energy levels. Okay.

425
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:57.620
David Schaich (he): what kind of energy is H. Bar Omega?

426
00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:02.560
David Schaich (he): We need to take the what

427
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.520
David Schaich (he): of the bose-einstein

428
00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.700
David Schaich (he): partition function in order to get this photon

429
00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:13.740
David Schaich (he): potential

430
00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:18.690
David Schaich (he): that comes with overall factor of minus temperature?

431
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:21.620
David Schaich (he): And we actually did this calculation before the break.

432
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.030
David Schaich (he): If we do it without much trouble by taking the long of the product

433
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.710
David Schaich (he): of those energy levels, just gets the sum

434
00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:33.990
David Schaich (he): over the board.

435
00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:38.580
David Schaich (he): dispose on a side that

436
00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:39.230
sure

437
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:48.580
David Schaich (he): what am I? This e. To the minus beta, increase temperature times that minus the chemical potential

438
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:55.740
David Schaich (he): which we can convert into a sum over all of the

439
00:39:56.410 --> 00:40:00.610
David Schaich (he): 3 vectors. K. That we have for a given.

440
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:09.520
David Schaich (he): We are in this. You can plug in H bar and negative.

441
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:17.210
David Schaich (he): or the photon energy, keeping in mind that it possible that they are going to be some function.

442
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:18.170
David Schaich (he): Oh.

443
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:20.110
David Schaich (he): these

444
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.900
David Schaich (he): momentum vectors or wave vectors. K.

445
00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:31.610
David Schaich (he): There's a fact with 2 here, my inserted just to in agreements with nature. This has to do with

446
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:32.550
interesting

447
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.260
David Schaich (he): back to that. i'll tell you, for now

448
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.960
David Schaich (he): you know, followers

449
00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:42.030
David Schaich (he): desire. We can look at it in more detail in

450
00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.340
David Schaich (he): every so time, even with a given

451
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.710
David Schaich (he): momentum, has 2

452
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:54.470
David Schaich (he): possible states. You know this polarizations.

453
00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.540
David Schaich (he): so

454
00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:03.150
David Schaich (he): every single energy level is going to be doubly degenerates

455
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.240
David Schaich (he): due to that quantum polarization.

456
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.930
David Schaich (he): in addition to any other

457
00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:19.690
David Schaich (he): see from permutations of the direction of those moments of in the three-dimensional space. So the ground state

458
00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.000
David Schaich (he): definitely degenerate in this case, and then

459
00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:23.970
yes.

460
00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:32.530
David Schaich (he): exciting to see if we look at before we go to 6 times. He generates the combination of permutation and polarization

461
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:41.760
David Schaich (he): in practice. in our actual calculations. and to simplify

462
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:44.960
David Schaich (he): those calculations.

463
00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:56.410
David Schaich (he): we can think briefly about the physics that we're going after before starting through the mathematics is required to describe it

464
00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:04.970
David Schaich (he): in particular. The fact that we are talking about photons here which

465
00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:09.650
David Schaich (he): are all around us. They are streaming out of all the lights in this room.

466
00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:13.370
David Schaich (he): being created by that projector

467
00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.060
David Schaich (he): screen over there.

468
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:19.780
David Schaich (he): all with a relatively little

469
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.390
David Schaich (he): energy calls.

470
00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.460
David Schaich (he): and at the same time all of those

471
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:26.700
guys

472
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:40.340
David Schaich (he): off of the screen, and so on, are being absorbed by our eyes again without not causing it too much increase in the energy that our eyes experience. not being cooked by the life that you see

473
00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.560
David Schaich (he): at least the level of light in this room.

474
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.150
David Schaich (he): All of which is

475
00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:55.250
David Schaich (he): what I me when I say that photons are

476
00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:58.900
David Schaich (he): easy to create and absorb

477
00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:06.700
David Schaich (he): in the sense that it takes very little energy

478
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:09.780
David Schaich (he): to change

479
00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:13.820
David Schaich (he): the phone number by.

480
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:31.660
David Schaich (he): And if we recall yes. the chemical potential correspond to such a change in energy in response to a change in the photon number we can have a very large

481
00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.880
David Schaich (he): changing in with very small change in E.

482
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:45.720
David Schaich (he): Recall that this change has to be considered in the micro canonical ensemble if they fix entropy that turns out not to affect the conclusion

483
00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:50.870
David Schaich (he): at this chemical potential for a full time. Gas is in general an extremely small number

484
00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:51.970
David Schaich (he): that we can

485
00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:54.450
David Schaich (he): approximate to be 0,

486
00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:59.680
David Schaich (he): which is still consistent with hour

487
00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:06.600
David Schaich (he): requirement for the convergence of both Einstein distribution.

488
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:13.080
David Schaich (he): Since we're, we've restricted ourselves to positive omega with positive frequencies

489
00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:17.330
David Schaich (he): we can set you to 0

490
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:18.870
David Schaich (he): and still have it be

491
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:22.580
David Schaich (he): less than all of those photon energy levels.

492
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:24.710
David Schaich (he): so that the

493
00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.780
David Schaich (he): both Einstein distribution will still emerge.

494
00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:35.780
David Schaich (he): Pick up with the We have written down already

495
00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:40.130
David Schaich (he): a second simplification.

496
00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:55.650
David Schaich (he): You have 5 before it'll just be repeating what we did in classical model. In this context. See that

497
00:44:57.370 --> 00:45:02.210
David Schaich (he): you want to consider volumes that are large compared to the characteristic wavelengths

498
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:08.280
David Schaich (he): of these photons. That's probably easier for you so happy.

499
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:15.910
David Schaich (he): or hundreds of nanometers scale, they correspond to visible light. It doesn't take much of a box to

500
00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:26.410
David Schaich (he): very closely spaced set of moment, so allow

501
00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.400
David Schaich (he): that we can

502
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.270
David Schaich (he): you to integrate over rather than

503
00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.910
David Schaich (he): wrestling with discrete.

504
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:40.660
David Schaich (he): This is an argument that we

505
00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:48.120
David Schaich (he): went through previously. Some of the later. The points in that closely space

506
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:56.990
David Schaich (he): moment, so we can approximately some over the very well by integrals

507
00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.930
David Schaich (he): economical potential for the

508
00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:02.430
the

509
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.220
David Schaich (he): approximately

510
00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:09.120
David Schaich (he): 2 T times integral Oh.

511
00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:15.870
David Schaich (he): one minus C to H. Bar Mega kind of over

512
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.400
we set to 0.

513
00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:20.020
We integrated over

514
00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:23.210
David Schaich (he): the wave numbers

515
00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.750
David Schaich (he): each of the 3 directions.

516
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:32.660
David Schaich (he): Since we're interested in frequencies that

517
00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.040
David Schaich (he): proportional to

518
00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:43.520
David Schaich (he): the square, the inner product of those 3 components of the what you

519
00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:47.930
or proportional to the magnitude of the vector

520
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:52.080
David Schaich (he): that suggests we will benefit from

521
00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.860
David Schaich (he): X. Y. Z. Spherical coordinates

522
00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:02.610
David Schaich (he): when we do, though we want to make sure that we

523
00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:08.420
David Schaich (he): enforce our requirement that all of the K's are

524
00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:09.990
David Schaich (he): strictly positive.

525
00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:11.610
so

526
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:17.480
David Schaich (he): require a positive. I mean. So

527
00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:22.900
David Schaich (he): in this integral and spherical coordinates you want to integrate over

528
00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:24.840
David Schaich (he): only over a single

529
00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:40.030
David Schaich (he): options in 3 dimensional space so mathematically what this corresponds to? Yes. integrating from 0 to infinity that continuously during

530
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.490
David Schaich (he): Hey X 24.

531
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.330
David Schaich (he): Why?

532
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.340
David Schaich (he): And

533
00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:52.340
David Schaich (he): is that

534
00:47:54.440 --> 00:48:06.160
David Schaich (he): you have all possible momenta a possible magnitude for these 3 vectors in spherical coordinates. But the integrations over the angular variables.

535
00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:12.600
David Schaich (he): the only go over it. Your single options time

536
00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:17.040
David Schaich (he): 55, rather than going from

537
00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:24.300
David Schaich (he): 0 to pi and 0, 2 pi. Both of these angular integrals i'm. Restricted by this positivity to

538
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:38.820
David Schaich (he): running from 0 up to high halves. So that's easy. We're just integrating the 5 by itself. That's a factor of pi haves integral of sine theta

539
00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:49.430
David Schaich (he): negative cosine. It has at 0 we pick up another negative side of cosine. subtracting the cosine of 0 that overall it just gives one.

540
00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:51.600
David Schaich (he): and

541
00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.110
David Schaich (he): we are left

542
00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:57.450
David Schaich (he): with this integral over all 3.

543
00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:03.330
David Schaich (he): Here's what you like, is there? It's breaking down the I have times

544
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:08.740
David Schaich (he): you need to go over a squared Dk.

545
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:13.500
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

546
00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:24.050
David Schaich (he): you can now insert this constant proportionality between the frequency. And then

547
00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:29.080
David Schaich (he): we vector

548
00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:32.830
David Schaich (he): Okay, that, says the lens of the cave, is that frequency omega

549
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.170
David Schaich (he): over C times Pi right?

550
00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.360
David Schaich (he): Based on the picture of

551
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.400
David Schaich (he): waves being fit into a length. L.

552
00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:50.480
David Schaich (he): So C. Pi over L. It's inverted

553
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:55.540
David Schaich (he): and clicking that in is

554
00:49:56.930 --> 00:50:05.930
David Schaich (he): your full time, green, economical potential. The 2 over to cancels it out leads higher times T.

555
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:09.190
David Schaich (he): To go from 0 to infinity.

556
00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:14.980
David Schaich (he): A hat squared well, one minus the exponential

557
00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.560
David Schaich (he): factor of Dk. X.

558
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.350
David Schaich (he): So we have

559
00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.680
David Schaich (he): a squared and Dk

560
00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.000
David Schaich (he): to bring in 3 powers of

561
00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.480
David Schaich (he): L. Over C. Pi.

562
00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:32.410
David Schaich (he): Lq. Is the volume.

563
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:34.520
temperature

564
00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:37.540
David Schaich (he): 3 h of C, and then

565
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.490
David Schaich (he): pi over Pi cubed it's pi squared the denominator

566
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:49.720
David Schaich (he): integration come out the same. It's just the constant factor of so we have an Omega squared log

567
00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.710
minus E to the

568
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:54.980
David Schaich (he): maybe the beach for Omega over temperature.

569
00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:59.620
David Schaich (he): You, Omega. and that is the

570
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:04.880
David Schaich (he): grant theological potential for a gaps of photons that

571
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:07.510
David Schaich (he): after a brief break, we will

572
00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:12.960
David Schaich (he): use to derive energy equation, state

573
00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:26.010
David Schaich (he): things about the any questions about this derivation so far before we break for few minutes up until the until 100'clock.

574
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:33.030
Yibo Dai: Is that mute? The energy of the

575
00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:37.260
David Schaich (he): pause, the recording, and pick up at the start of the hour.

576
00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:45.540
David Schaich (he): So

577
00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:52.000
David Schaich (he): go ahead and zoom the recording now and say a couple of questions that arise during

578
00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:55.710
David Schaich (he): that break. The first that i'll deal with

579
00:51:56.020 --> 00:52:03.860
David Schaich (he): because it came in first and hopefully will be quicker to deal with this reminder. What is new.

580
00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:11.780
David Schaich (he): And these expressions, starting from great economical partition that we have, this

581
00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:14.600
David Schaich (he): factor of new is

582
00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:17.650
David Schaich (he): the chemical potential.

583
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:19.630
the grand canonical

584
00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:22.770
David Schaich (he): ensemble. So going back to

585
00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:24.460
David Schaich (he): Yes.

586
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.030
David Schaich (he): illustration that we have comparing the

587
00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.250
David Schaich (he): 3. So we're dealing with

588
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:34.820
David Schaich (he): you that

589
00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:38.140
David Schaich (he): chemical potential that is set

590
00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:55.580
David Schaich (he): bye the particle reservoir. It has the same dimensions as the energy and temperature, so it appears. just as a quantity being subtracted from the energy levels in the brand canonical partition function.

591
00:52:56.060 --> 00:53:00.600
David Schaich (he): So it has the dimensions of energy. But it is not self and energy.

592
00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:07.300
David Schaich (he): It's related to the amount of energy that corresponds to each particle in the gas

593
00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:10.970
David Schaich (he): sometimes called that chemical work

594
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:14.720
David Schaich (he): that we talked about briefly just before the break.

595
00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:28.710
David Schaich (he): So follow up if confusion about that the other question is going back over the relation between all of the variables that we have introduced.

596
00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:30.580
David Schaich (he): Now that we are looking at

597
00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:33.250
David Schaich (he): these particles as

598
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.350
David Schaich (he): both particles and waves.

599
00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:39.100
David Schaich (he): and in particular, the

600
00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:48.370
David Schaich (he): connection between weight like moment of frequency and the L. That we be using to regulate our system the finite volume of.

601
00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:54.410
David Schaich (he): but into. so that we have the accountable number of microstates and well-defined

602
00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:56.200
David Schaich (he): Oh.

603
00:53:56.230 --> 00:54:02.020
David Schaich (he): partition functions that sum over all of those microstates, all those energy levels

604
00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:04.430
David Schaich (he): so

605
00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:11.180
David Schaich (he): back all the way in the sequence unit for the lecture notes. When we first looked at

606
00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.140
David Schaich (he): regulating classical

607
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:17.040
non-relativistic.

608
00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.880
David Schaich (he): we introduced the on that

609
00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:26.840
David Schaich (he): of the momenta of each particle in the gas could only take certain integer values

610
00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:29.160
David Schaich (he): that

611
00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:33.680
David Schaich (he): the moment so I had to be

612
00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:39.030
David Schaich (he): h bar times this pi over L. Times something to your K.

613
00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:43.630
David Schaich (he): Now, back at that point, when everything was classical.

614
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:46.310
David Schaich (he): mathematical trick, let us write down

615
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:50.390
David Schaich (he): accountable number of microstates to some over how you work

616
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:57.030
David Schaich (he): a non-negative integers in each of the 3 directions, hey X.

617
00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:01.090
David Schaich (he): And it's this connection between

618
00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:08.350
David Schaich (he): particles as concept of ways that justify this mathematical trick

619
00:55:08.410 --> 00:55:10.260
David Schaich (he): a fundamental physical level.

620
00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:12.230
We

621
00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:23.510
David Schaich (he): think about waves in on volume Lq. So in each direction of that point. In this case we call it an X. The requirements that

622
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:37.370
David Schaich (he): the wave fit evenly in that volume requires that they can only have certain wavelengths. and then fix the course on my frequencies

623
00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:40.420
David Schaich (he): due to the

624
00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:48.570
David Schaich (he): we have relation between the frequency wave life and the speed of that wave. A photon. That's the speed of light

625
00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:52.780
David Schaich (he): that is true. Actually, for any wave. Those of you who have

626
00:55:53.100 --> 00:56:08.130
David Schaich (he): done ways in previous modules. maybe more familiar with this sort of relation to this. What! You're thinking about energies where you like some frequencies, and those you were saying for the first time.

627
00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:13.590
David Schaich (he): I should say that this illustration here is from

628
00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:17.590
David Schaich (he): and Schrodinger's introduction to thermal physics. I just

629
00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:20.010
David Schaich (he): copied it out that textbook and

630
00:56:20.350 --> 00:56:22.720
David Schaich (he): consulting that textbook made.

631
00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:23.710
David Schaich (he): given

632
00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.400
David Schaich (he): a useful way of thinking about.

633
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:32.070
David Schaich (he): If the lecture knows themselves, they'll make it clear.

634
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.810
David Schaich (he): But basically what we are doing is

635
00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:40.740
David Schaich (he): deriving. Probably not. And we're justified

636
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:45.800
David Schaich (he): physical approach that mathematical trick that we had before that there are

637
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:50.160
David Schaich (he): to stop. It is your possibilities for

638
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:52.760
momenta of particles

639
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:56.640
David Schaich (he): that in this case is resulting from the

640
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:04.750
David Schaich (he): in that corresponding box. So this is where the is coming from.

641
00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:08.240
David Schaich (he): I didn't use that same

642
00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:11.030
David Schaich (he): reason we call in between

643
00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:16.840
David Schaich (he): the individual components. Can you like you said in the inner product K, which is the

644
00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:23.100
David Schaich (he): square root of the sum of K x squared plus k y squared.

645
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:25.300
David Schaich (he): It's just

646
00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.450
David Schaich (he): a single dimension that's easy to draw.

647
00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:29.780
David Schaich (he): Oh, no.

648
00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:33.600
David Schaich (he): she the paper, and then the 3 dimensions that they

649
00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:34.810
David Schaich (he): gas is actually

650
00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:39.170
David Schaich (he): living inside. So

651
00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:45.220
David Schaich (he): is that which you in a good position to sorry ahead.

652
00:57:50.610 --> 00:57:53.310
David Schaich (he): I feel pretty sure. How about you?

653
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:57.230
David Schaich (he): Those answers are

654
00:57:59.090 --> 00:58:10.920
David Schaich (he): also be causing more confusion that they resolved. But for the time being we have now the somewhat simplified expression for the grant theonical potential.

655
00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:11.660
This.

656
00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:15.770
David Schaich (he): yes, of.

657
00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:19.870
David Schaich (he): We have a zoom as part of that simplification that

658
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:22.550
so it's large compared to what you're playing.

659
00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:26.690
David Schaich (he): so that the you energies and momenta are

660
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:37.350
David Schaich (he): varying approximately, continuously, you can approximate the sum over those discrete momentum integrals over continuous

661
00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:42.070
David Schaich (he): frequencies restricted to the positive.

662
00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:54.770
David Schaich (he): and that gives us a cast into the form of the frequency of Lego. an integral over all possible frequencies for our photons of

663
00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:58.460
David Schaich (he): I don't make a square times the long

664
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.110
David Schaich (he): that you get from video. I break another cool

665
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:10.230
David Schaich (he): partition function, the usual. and from what we've learned about the Grand Canonical

666
00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:12.090
David Schaich (he): on some in general.

667
00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:22.610
David Schaich (he): you know that the internal energy, entropy, pressure. and so on. Related to derivatives

668
00:59:22.890 --> 00:59:25.610
David Schaich (he): of this screen canonical potential.

669
00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:30.220
David Schaich (he): The internal energy specifically, is

670
00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:34.110
David Schaich (he): related to the temperature of the

671
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:38.050
David Schaich (he): of the

672
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:50.810
David Schaich (he): divided by to with negative signs, plus that chemical potential, You times the expectation for the particle number. We argued that

673
00:59:51.890 --> 01:00:03.350
David Schaich (he): the chemical potential photon, you ask should be. Take it to 0. It's a good approximation which leaves a somewhat simpler expression for the internal energy. In this case. if I

674
01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:14.320
David Schaich (he): change variables from T to the inverse temperature beta that cancels out that negative sign factor of 2 squared. It's just

675
01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.230
David Schaich (he): with respect to data of

676
01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:22.340
David Schaich (he): at the times the potential

677
01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:25.810
David Schaich (he): so plugging in the

678
01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:31.230
David Schaich (he): potential for our photon gas. We have

679
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:35.140
David Schaich (he): that factor of Beta cancelling out factor of T

680
01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:41.280
David Schaich (he): council factors. So V over C. Q. Pi squared

681
01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:44.210
David Schaich (he): with the integral

682
01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.820
David Schaich (he): overall frequencies. Omega

683
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:52.520
David Schaich (he): Everything that depends on

684
01:00:53.980 --> 01:01:02.920
David Schaich (he): the inverse temperature. Beta is in that integral. I forgot to write the wall outside of the

685
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:17.260
David Schaich (he): so we have the derivative of the check, the beta of the law. one minus exponential factor inside this integral. which

686
01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:26.370
David Schaich (he): is easy enough to compute. You have the derivative of the log, one

687
01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.170
David Schaich (he): minus the

688
01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:31.350
David Schaich (he): the numerator.

689
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:38.870
David Schaich (he): a negative E. This be an age call

690
01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:41.180
the call to

691
01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:42.260
David Schaich (he): negative.

692
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:50.800
David Schaich (he): so the negative signs cancel out.

693
01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:56.690
David Schaich (he): We can define numerator and denominator by that exponential factor.

694
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:19.030
David Schaich (he): all that is left in the integral. It's 3. How was of Mega? I'll go into the the the H model. They go

695
01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.350
this one.

696
01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.640
David Schaich (he): which I said 3. But I look 2

697
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:39.320
David Schaich (he): in the numerator there. If we consider the energy density you have rather than the energy as a whole.

698
01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:47.270
David Schaich (he): you can right. This

699
01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:51.290
David Schaich (he): is

700
01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:54.160
David Schaich (he): H. Bar over. Well.

701
01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:58.580
David Schaich (he): if you write this as an integral over.

702
01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:03.270
David Schaich (he): let's call a spectral density

703
01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:07.290
David Schaich (he): it as a function of

704
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.490
David Schaich (he): Omega. So what this is

705
01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:20.560
David Schaich (he): doing, similar to the way that we have a probability distribution that we are probability density. That means you get a probability.

706
01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.320
David Schaich (he): We have introduced a function.

707
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:27.500
David Schaich (he): the it's a function of the frequency omega

708
01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.120
David Schaich (he): that we integrate to

709
01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:35.870
David Schaich (he): get the spectrum or the average energy per unit volume. So the public

710
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:39.830
David Schaich (he): just stop

711
01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:43.250
David Schaich (he): the normalization factor here, but

712
01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:44.520
mental.

713
01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:45.700
David Schaich (he): So

714
01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:49.850
David Schaich (he): and this way you're buying things.

715
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.860
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

716
01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:55.370
David Schaich (he): The spectral density

717
01:03:55.850 --> 01:04:00.050
David Schaich (he): of protons is just this quality that we are integrating over

718
01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:04.870
David Schaich (he): how some factor of each part see huge, I square

719
01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:06.860
the

720
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:19.820
David Schaich (he): I'll make it. you know. Make a queue e to the beta hr Omega minus one. It appears as the arguments of that energy.

721
01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.500
David Schaich (he): And this is a

722
01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:28.350
David Schaich (he): famous quality in this function

723
01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:34.310
David Schaich (he): that is known as

724
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:39.170
David Schaich (he): like spectrum.

725
01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.410
David Schaich (he): So spectrum, that's a short hand for spectral density.

726
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:49.410
David Schaich (he): The Planck spectrum is so named because it was introduced by Max Phone.

727
01:04:51.610 --> 01:05:03.650
David Schaich (he): I don't know what I think. for reasons that we will soon observe on the consider the a higher. No energy limits of this function

728
01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:07.890
David Schaich (he): we can

729
01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:11.460
David Schaich (he): for the purpose of

730
01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:18.670
David Schaich (he): looking at those limits. We can the criminal layer right? The planning spectrum

731
01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:24.730
David Schaich (he): as a function? 3 flags

732
01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.990
David Schaich (he): rather than energy.

733
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:31.710
David Schaich (he): Since you

734
01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.410
David Schaich (he): wave length, is

735
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:46.280
David Schaich (he): it's conjugate variable variable to frequency. So set up a function frequency. We have the flight. Spectrum has a function of

736
01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:51.170
David Schaich (he): we've length.

737
01:05:52.880 --> 01:06:01.290
David Schaich (he): So. looking at the integral that we have here for the energy density.

738
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:09.120
David Schaich (he): You want to change variables

739
01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.810
David Schaich (he): from Omega

740
01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:20.580
David Schaich (he): the frequency to that inverse frequency.

741
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:23.810
David Schaich (he): So with

742
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:26.240
David Schaich (he): there we go.

743
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:28.630
David Schaich (he): the

744
01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:33.540
David Schaich (he): inverse of frequency with the calculation of 2 pi.

745
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:39.350
David Schaich (he): and the integral is going to be a minus

746
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:40.640
David Schaich (he): 2. I see

747
01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:41.740
square.

748
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:43.890
David Schaich (he): and

749
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:48.350
David Schaich (he): when Omega is 0,

750
01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:50.130
David Schaich (he): you see that corresponds to

751
01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.920
David Schaich (he): Lambda

752
01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:58.690
David Schaich (he): and the Integral. Slowly as I make it, goes to infinity, and it goes to 0.

753
01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:09.840
David Schaich (he): The order integration has been swapped. I'll make a queue in the numerator. It is 2 I see over wavelengths to.

754
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:14.150
David Schaich (he): We have an exponential factor of

755
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:17.140
David Schaich (he): now 2 Pi

756
01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:23.640
David Schaich (he): C. Over Lambda. the denominator.

757
01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.820
David Schaich (he): minus 2, 5, c. Over.

758
01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.140
and the square.

759
01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:40.120
David Schaich (he): So, collecting all of these powers of 2 and the like, we have 8 and 16,

760
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:46.110
David Schaich (he): we have 4 h of time. The numerator, 2 of which it cancel out.

761
01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.070
David Schaich (he): Steve, I squared.

762
01:07:49.800 --> 01:08:02.350
David Schaich (he): We have still that same I, curious to one that 4 powers of speed of light. 3 of which cancel out.

763
01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:09.330
David Schaich (he): and and we can reverse the order of integration.

764
01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:15.110
David Schaich (he): a negative sign. good.

765
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:18.140
David Schaich (he): more familiar, integral from 0 to infinity.

766
01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:19.840
David Schaich (he): Now, out of

767
01:08:20.859 --> 01:08:25.290
David Schaich (he): just D Lambda. cell phone, numerator. we

768
01:08:25.649 --> 01:08:29.630
David Schaich (he): 3 plus 2 is 5. How is it Lambda

769
01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:38.050
David Schaich (he): in the denominator exponential factor minus one?

770
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:41.290
David Schaich (he): We're in other words, to write this.

771
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:46.770
David Schaich (he): so it's not so squeezed against the edge of the page.

772
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:51.270
David Schaich (he): It's like spectrum in terms of wavelength.

773
01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:54.930
David Schaich (he): is 16.

774
01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.380
David Schaich (he): I,

775
01:08:58.939 --> 01:09:01.410
David Schaich (he): with 5 h of land, though

776
01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:06.670
David Schaich (he): with that similar exponential factor

777
01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:10.729
David Schaich (he): into the 2

778
01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:14.500
David Schaich (he): minus one. which

779
01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:18.090
David Schaich (he): it looks like this.

780
01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.180
David Schaich (he): So plot

781
01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:22.680
David Schaich (he): that grab from

782
01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:27.660
David Schaich (he): that shows

783
01:09:29.649 --> 01:09:38.880
David Schaich (he): they call the spectral ratings what that is. It's just proportional to the it's been divided by

784
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:46.870
David Schaich (he): I'm: Sorry multiple

785
01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.800
David Schaich (he): energy density to hey

786
01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.390
David Schaich (he): you that area! What are you calling?

787
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:09.220
David Schaich (he): We can match? Oh, this these 3 curves for different powers of

788
01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:11.320
David Schaich (he): temperature.

789
01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:24.230
David Schaich (he): So the beta is the inverse temperature. So as the temperature varies, it's going to affect the exponential factor in. and

790
01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:29.630
David Schaich (he): 3 cases of these temperature is 3,000 4,000 5,000Kelvin.

791
01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:32.760
David Schaich (he): It could be same limit in

792
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:39.570
David Schaich (he): ultimately. that is. shortly once with high energy.

793
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:41.880
David Schaich (he): So

794
01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:44.260
David Schaich (he): is.

795
01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.960
David Schaich (he): and it goes to

796
01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.720
David Schaich (he): 0.

797
01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:53.220
David Schaich (he): In the ultraviolet we have

798
01:10:54.660 --> 01:11:01.010
David Schaich (he): 2 different types of behavior, these 2 different factors, one over

799
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:03.350
David Schaich (he): that urge polynomially.

800
01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:17.580
David Schaich (he): We also have this complicated expression, one over the exponential. Oh. 2 Pi Hrc. And over that temperature times, Lambda. For a small lambda.

801
01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:25.330
David Schaich (he): The argument of the exponentially gets large. So the exponential itself is exponentially large. and the the group from the exponential.

802
01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:29.020
David Schaich (he): It's going to

803
01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:33.560
David Schaich (he): kill off that. How are the versions?

804
01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.910
David Schaich (he): What we expect?

805
01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:46.260
David Schaich (he): The spectrum with the radiance, computer chromos

806
01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:48.600
David Schaich (he): to

807
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:56.000
David Schaich (he): all to 0 exponentially quickly, which is indeed what is here in that limit.

808
01:11:57.250 --> 01:12:02.970
David Schaich (he): the exponential factors dominating over the divergence that we would have without it.

809
01:12:03.670 --> 01:12:06.420
David Schaich (he): If we look at the infrared.

810
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:09.370
David Schaich (he): So that is

811
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:21.080
David Schaich (he): 4 relatively large wavelengths. Here they are expressed in terms of micrometers. but in general

812
01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.170
David Schaich (he): we say that the

813
01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:26.730
David Schaich (he): way of life is large

814
01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.270
for the

815
01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:44.500
David Schaich (he): compared to the other factors that are showing up for the argument of the exponential and the pre-factor. So compared to

816
01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:57.900
David Schaich (he): that each part, c. A combination of your conversion factors that it's we can expand that exponential.

817
01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:07.220
David Schaich (he): 2 Pi Hrc. Minus one. We need to turn this one that cancels the next term, they just

818
01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:11.730
David Schaich (he): to over L.

819
01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.560
David Schaich (he): We can drop all of the higher phones

820
01:13:17.410 --> 01:13:20.120
David Schaich (he): plugging this expansion into

821
01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.510
David Schaich (he): the playing spectrum.

822
01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:26.070
David Schaich (he): We have

823
01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:31.270
David Schaich (he): disappearing in the

824
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:34.610
David Schaich (he): the pieces.

825
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:36.710
David Schaich (he): 1, 2,

826
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:41.480
David Schaich (he): one over one of

827
01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:46.540
David Schaich (he): 200 Hrc. In the denominator.

828
01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:48.990
David Schaich (he): So

829
01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:54.340
David Schaich (he): 16 over 2 is 8, 1 h pilot.

830
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:58.310
David Schaich (he): All the Hrc factors cancel as do

831
01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:04.490
David Schaich (he): one of the 5 h to plan it in the numerator. That Beta is the inverse temperature.

832
01:14:06.010 --> 01:14:06.910
David Schaich (he): and

833
01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:10.480
David Schaich (he): 4 h of the wavelengths are left in the

834
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.320
David Schaich (he): denominator.

835
01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:22.230
David Schaich (he): and this one over one to the fourth expression for yes.

836
01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.350
David Schaich (he): is

837
01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:34.460
David Schaich (he): what is shown here in the black lines. It's a label of classical theory. So

838
01:14:38.650 --> 01:14:40.270
David Schaich (he): a high temperature over.

839
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:42.150
Thank you that the fourth

840
01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:47.530
David Schaich (he): we can see that you quantum prediction for the energy density

841
01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:53.820
David Schaich (he): approaches in classical theory in

842
01:14:55.590 --> 01:15:02.180
David Schaich (he): limits of no energies or large wavelengths, which you could also relate to the

843
01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:05.770
David Schaich (he): So before I knew that

844
01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:09.630
David Schaich (he): back in

845
01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:18.470
David Schaich (he): this expression here also

846
01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:20.870
David Schaich (he): holds.

847
01:15:24.230 --> 01:15:26.740
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Beta is small

848
01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:32.370
David Schaich (he): work for the just as well. When that is large or even small, they show up

849
01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:34.140
David Schaich (he): one over the other.

850
01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.450
David Schaich (he): connects this to

851
01:15:40.690 --> 01:15:52.960
David Schaich (he): limit of high temperatures. Yeah, we looked at in general before the break the regime, what we should expect statistics to reproduce classical

852
01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:59.470
David Schaich (he): predictions. and this 8 pi T. Over advantage of the fourth is indeed

853
01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.880
David Schaich (he): possible

854
01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:05.330
David Schaich (he): computation for

855
01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:10.970
David Schaich (he): spectral function of photons

856
01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:15.760
David Schaich (he): without accounting for of the facts.

857
01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:21.160
David Schaich (he): Spectrum

858
01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:32.460
David Schaich (he): was derived on the basis of Cisco physics something 1890. So a few years before

859
01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:35.360
David Schaich (he): his

860
01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:42.110
David Schaich (he): version is your finance of this spectrum. and that refinement is motivated

861
01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.260
that we can see here

862
01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:54.880
David Schaich (he): that's just having a single factor of 2 to the fourth means that the and if You' that to me. even if a single phone is going to

863
01:16:55.010 --> 01:17:01.910
David Schaich (he): diverge in the ultraviolet where that we like. Finally, it's small. The energy is, get large.

864
01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:06.180
David Schaich (he): So if we' to use the spectrum to a few things like

865
01:17:06.250 --> 01:17:12.980
David Schaich (he): the energy of the entropy. classically single, particle

866
01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:23.220
David Schaich (he): integrated over all of the energies that it can have that corresponds to integrating over all the wavelengths. Classically, we immediately get affinity from that

867
01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.430
David Schaich (he): the prediction that every

868
01:17:26.610 --> 01:17:27.540
energy

869
01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:29.290
David Schaich (he): and it was to

870
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:34.260
David Schaich (he): share that and produce a spectrum

871
01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.840
David Schaich (he): that if you're, it looks more

872
01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.370
David Schaich (he): like what we

873
01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:41.560
David Schaich (he): sources of light of the sun

874
01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:42.960
David Schaich (he): that me

875
01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:45.890
David Schaich (he): introduced this exponential factor

876
01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:52.760
David Schaich (he): that reduces to the classical. and you set no

877
01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:56.000
David Schaich (he): but resolved what it's called is ultraviolet

878
01:17:56.590 --> 01:17:57.860
David Schaich (he): catastrophe.

879
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:01.980
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

880
01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.710
David Schaich (he): in the only 19 hundreds. And

881
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:08.950
David Schaich (he): there's a fun historical story around that. That

882
01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.870
David Schaich (he): this is well before quantum physics

883
01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:16.580
David Schaich (he): existed. It was one of the steps along the path to that like basically

884
01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:28.550
David Schaich (he): fudged in this exponential factor as what he called an active desperation. He didn't know where it was coming from. He just saw that it was needed to match experimental observations.

885
01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:34.560
David Schaich (he): and being able to explain, derive thanks, acts of desperation.

886
01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:35.420
Yes.

887
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:41.710
David Schaich (he): oh. achievements of quantum physics that we have now

888
01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:47.850
David Schaich (he): reproduced in this module, just from all our

889
01:18:48.720 --> 01:19:01.530
David Schaich (he): set up both of the Grand Canonical partition function and the quantum approach to defining micro space. We I've been able to resolve the

890
01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:04.890
David Schaich (he): just to put this on it.

891
01:19:06.190 --> 01:19:06.940
David Schaich (he): The

892
01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:11.310
David Schaich (he): notes here for future reference, because

893
01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.930
David Schaich (he): that's classical spectrum

894
01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:19.290
David Schaich (he): to bridges.

895
01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.780
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Ultraviolet

896
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:30.560
David Schaich (he): catastrophe for

897
01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:34.050
David Schaich (he): classical physics

898
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:42.980
David Schaich (he): that causing statistics. That's all. By reproducing links, active desperation.

899
01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:51.160
David Schaich (he): There are a few other interesting things we can say about this like distribution, for we actually

900
01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:56.070
David Schaich (he): complete the integration. See the energy density itself.

901
01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:58.540
David Schaich (he): So

902
01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:07.700
David Schaich (he): what would they if for you? Look at this figure we had here without consuming out to see it again. and see that the

903
01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:17.450
David Schaich (he): maximum of the distribution is shifting to different wavelengths as the temperature varies.

904
01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.210
David Schaich (he): and in particular

905
01:20:20.770 --> 01:20:23.080
David Schaich (he): for temperatures of

906
01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:26.530
David Schaich (he): of some time the actual temperature of about 5,000 kelvin.

907
01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.470
David Schaich (he): The

908
01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:33.200
David Schaich (he): maximum of

909
01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:47.560
David Schaich (he): it's, like spectral function. is within that range of visible light. We of if you 100 nanometers or

910
01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.580
David Schaich (he): point 1, 2,

911
01:20:52.210 --> 01:20:54.190
David Schaich (he): roughly point 4 to point 7.

912
01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:16.450
David Schaich (he): It's an interesting exercise to actually take the derivative of the spectrum that computes the position of that maximum as a function of temperature. For now we can just

913
01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.040
David Schaich (he): you can tend to

914
01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.100
David Schaich (he): look at this data.

915
01:21:27.710 --> 01:21:30.870
David Schaich (he): Connected to the interpretation

916
01:21:37.730 --> 01:21:43.600
David Schaich (he): is the observation that this is not a coincidence. The

917
01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.560
David Schaich (he): visible spectrum of wavelengths

918
01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.410
David Schaich (he): is actually visible.

919
01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:51.700
David Schaich (he): because

920
01:21:53.950 --> 01:21:59.050
David Schaich (he): the something that reaches us as a gas of photons

921
01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.830
David Schaich (he): has a temperature of around

922
01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:11.370
David Schaich (he): 5,000 Kelvin be specific

923
01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:19.470
David Schaich (he): value is 5,800, Helen. and

924
01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.820
David Schaich (he): the way that

925
01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:29.530
David Schaich (he): we can determine the temperature of the sunlight that's reaching us through the

926
01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.870
David Schaich (he): the effective surface temperature of

927
01:22:37.710 --> 01:22:46.280
David Schaich (he): the so the reasonable assumption that the energies of photons are not too much affected by the

928
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:50.380
David Schaich (he): purity through empty space, from the sun to the earth.

929
01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:54.050
David Schaich (he): You get that by

930
01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:57.830
David Schaich (he): measuring the spectrum of

931
01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:05.410
David Schaich (he): energy is from the sun. So the spectrum of solar radiation is all

932
01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:07.980
David Schaich (he): on this figure.

933
01:23:11.230 --> 01:23:15.800
David Schaich (he): So this is something that we can look up at the song and measure

934
01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:17.180
using these

935
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.760
David Schaich (he): technology that was developed in the

936
01:23:24.810 --> 01:23:25.740
David Schaich (he): how it.

937
01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:29.080
David Schaich (he): how much. however.

938
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:33.780
David Schaich (he): or energy from some that we get

939
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:40.700
David Schaich (he): that visible

940
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:44.320
David Schaich (he): range of lights. we said before.

941
01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.130
about 400 to 700

942
01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:47.820
David Schaich (he): manual users.

943
01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.390
David Schaich (he): and

944
01:23:51.130 --> 01:23:52.610
David Schaich (he): if we measure the

945
01:23:53.970 --> 01:24:06.700
David Schaich (he): amount of energy power in that sunlight as a function of frequency. Pretty good. Well, the 2 curves here, one yellow, one red and yellow

946
01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:10.990
David Schaich (he): data, is what reaches the top of the earth's atmosphere.

947
01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:15.300
David Schaich (he): So traveling from the sun to the earth without too much

948
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:19.220
David Schaich (he): interference from the empty space in between

949
01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:26.620
David Schaich (he): the red is what is left over what makes it through the atmosphere to reach us at ground level.

950
01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:30.130
David Schaich (he): So some of the sunlight that

951
01:24:30.210 --> 01:24:33.490
David Schaich (he): it's the atmosphere. This is zoomed as it comes down

952
01:24:33.650 --> 01:24:38.740
David Schaich (he): from the top of the first atmosphere to a sea level

953
01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:44.250
David Schaich (he): in this case. So if we focus on some that reaches us more directly from this.

954
01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.010
David Schaich (he): You can fit that to the plank spectrum.

955
01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:57.960
David Schaich (he): This call here a our black body functional form.

956
01:24:58.470 --> 01:25:01.200
David Schaich (he): This is the black curve here

957
01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:03.830
David Schaich (he): that produces a

958
01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:06.440
David Schaich (he): reasonable

959
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:16.180
David Schaich (he): description of the observational data recalling that we have made the assumption that I will

960
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:20.030
David Schaich (he): completely non-interacting. It's an ideal gas of photons.

961
01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:26.940
David Schaich (he): So there is some discrepancy around the future visible life, and the higher people see

962
01:25:27.010 --> 01:25:31.170
David Schaich (he): tail of the ultraviolet. We'll just sell back body fish.

963
01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.670
David Schaich (he): But in general

964
01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.320
David Schaich (he): this is especially

965
01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:42.960
David Schaich (he): absorption phone.

966
01:25:44.110 --> 01:25:51.200
David Schaich (he): Let me see excellent description of the data by like spectrum P of the data to that functional form

967
01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:56.280
David Schaich (he): basically predicts the temperature of the sunlight that it's reaching us.

968
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.970
You can see

969
01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.730
David Schaich (he): the greatest it

970
01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:05.340
David Schaich (he): at sea level in that visible

971
01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:06.650
David Schaich (he): range

972
01:26:07.770 --> 01:26:09.820
David Schaich (he): makes sense. If we consider that

973
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:13.440
David Schaich (he): our eyes have evolved to the actual use

974
01:26:13.450 --> 01:26:14.470
David Schaich (he): I for you

975
01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:22.160
David Schaich (he): folks on the stats and you have available for this number of photons are coming in

976
01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.310
David Schaich (he): at the visible wave.

977
01:26:24.690 --> 01:26:26.700
David Schaich (he): They are visible evolutionarily.

978
01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:31.730
David Schaich (he): Yeah. The black body terminology.

979
01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:34.140
David Schaich (he): I should explain so

980
01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:43.700
David Schaich (he): a big historical. It's what people were talking about in the late 18 hundreds and early 19 touchers. The idea is but driving these

981
01:26:46.510 --> 01:26:48.830
David Schaich (he): spectrum, or the

982
01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.230
David Schaich (he): like spectrum.

983
01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:57.570
David Schaich (he): and all of the others working with them at the time we're considering the

984
01:26:57.860 --> 01:26:59.790
David Schaich (he): one that was being admitted

985
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.030
David Schaich (he): from some object at a given temperature.

986
01:27:04.530 --> 01:27:06.640
David Schaich (he): and in particular they wanted to

987
01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:12.350
David Schaich (he): think about the light being emitted in complete isolation, and now have to worry about

988
01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.520
David Schaich (he): like being reflected of that object as well.

989
01:27:16.090 --> 01:27:17.450
David Schaich (he): So we know that.

990
01:27:18.570 --> 01:27:19.300
David Schaich (he): Oh.

991
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:23.300
David Schaich (he): the common white corresponds to all of the

992
01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:29.720
David Schaich (he): what do you think of? Is it like being reflected by an object various different colors?

993
01:27:29.970 --> 01:27:32.680
David Schaich (he): It's not a part of it. Those photons

994
01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:38.360
David Schaich (he): a black body is one that perfectly absorbs all of the life that shines on it.

995
01:27:39.190 --> 01:27:43.870
David Schaich (he): so none of it is reflected. and none of it would contaminate the

996
01:27:45.330 --> 01:27:46.600
David Schaich (he): spectrum of

997
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:55.150
David Schaich (he): light that is being emitted by that object. At that temperature the admitted life would be considered in isolation

998
01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:03.840
David Schaich (he): without having to worry about reflected light. If we have that perfectly black object or a black body.

999
01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:12.140
David Schaich (he): So that is just the explanation for that. and about the terminology that you may well see

1000
01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:13.970
David Schaich (he): Pop up. So

1001
01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:27.870
David Schaich (he): from the source of fits, we can determine the effective surface temperature of the sun. That's actually how it's done. We don't Well, I thermometers up to the sun. What i'll be doing now

1002
01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:29.280
for determining

1003
01:28:29.410 --> 01:28:36.870
David Schaich (he): the temperature of the sun that could be determined a century ago, just based on the like spectrum.

1004
01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:43.220
David Schaich (he): We can even do that same procedure for distance stars. We get enough light

1005
01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:45.520
David Schaich (he): that we have

1006
01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:48.130
David Schaich (he): develop sensitive enough technology

1007
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:54.280
David Schaich (he): lightly received from distance. Stars can be measured in the same way as a function of wavelength.

1008
01:28:54.490 --> 01:28:59.160
David Schaich (he): It can be 6 to the my spectrum we can measure the

1009
01:29:00.370 --> 01:29:03.080
David Schaich (he): for sure of those stars

1010
01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:05.570
David Schaich (he): which varies

1011
01:29:08.150 --> 01:29:11.070
David Schaich (he): so in the order of magnitude of the

1012
01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.760
David Schaich (he): they are calling. What are called red stars have relatively

1013
01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:18.070
David Schaich (he): no temperatures.

1014
01:29:19.370 --> 01:29:20.570
David Schaich (he): so they

1015
01:29:24.850 --> 01:29:25.900
David Schaich (he): that's all.

1016
01:29:27.010 --> 01:29:31.870
David Schaich (he): Low temperature corresponds to a little energy toward that infrared

1017
01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:36.970
David Schaich (he): regime, or the red side of the physical spectrum.

1018
01:29:39.530 --> 01:29:43.830
David Schaich (he): 3,500 kelvin or less based on fittings on the spectrum.

1019
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:49.100
David Schaich (he): You know our blue stars that you have

1020
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:52.790
David Schaich (he): higher temperatures.

1021
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.880
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

1022
01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:57.740
rough scale is about 10,000, Kelvin.

1023
01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:05.430
David Schaich (he): and we can even measure the temperature of intergalactic space from

1024
01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:15.290
David Schaich (he): this approach they should be energy. Your phone is a function of frequency fits in the plank spectrum.

1025
01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:17.580
David Schaich (he): We get a temperature

1026
01:30:17.710 --> 01:30:20.020
David Schaich (he): approximately 2.7 kelvin.

1027
01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:25.120
David Schaich (he): which is

1028
01:30:27.570 --> 01:30:28.210
you

1029
01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:32.230
David Schaich (he): extremely interesting physics topic, and also an important one.

1030
01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:38.560
David Schaich (he): We do have enough time to talk about for a few minutes

1031
01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:44.460
David Schaich (he): when we look at photons that seem to be coming for intergalactic space.

1032
01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:47.110
David Schaich (he): What that really is is

1033
01:30:48.890 --> 01:30:52.120
David Schaich (he): the remnants of the Big Bang that he

1034
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:57.050
David Schaich (he): 14 billionyears ago, in the real numbers it's given the

1035
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:02.130
David Schaich (he): recall, the

1036
01:31:04.930 --> 01:31:07.100
David Schaich (he): cosmic microwave background.

1037
01:31:08.770 --> 01:31:10.430
David Schaich (he): So Photon set

1038
01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:18.250
David Schaich (he): left over from the Big Bang just reaching us

1039
01:31:21.230 --> 01:31:23.070
David Schaich (he): 14 billionyears

1040
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.930
David Schaich (he): later. Anyone that

1041
01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:30.210
David Schaich (he): this

1042
01:31:31.190 --> 01:31:34.240
David Schaich (he): image here can see that to fit in again

1043
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:35.400
David Schaich (he): is

1044
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:41.400
David Schaich (he): a something you might have seen before in this visualization of the temperature.

1045
01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:44.000
David Schaich (he): All that also is microwave background.

1046
01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:48.590
David Schaich (he): So what's going on

1047
01:31:50.710 --> 01:31:57.010
David Schaich (he): here is that we are looking up at the sky and projecting that onto

1048
01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:02.620
David Schaich (he): this angular oval just the same way that you can project the earth onto.

1049
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:10.290
David Schaich (he): and the lips of this shape and that we're looking down at the surface of your space. This is going the other direction.

1050
01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:15.110
David Schaich (he): looking at the sky and the service of the earth. unwrapping it into

1051
01:32:16.230 --> 01:32:20.100
David Schaich (he): even that spherical shell and rolling it out.

1052
01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:22.710
David Schaich (he): use a paper.

1053
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:26.790
David Schaich (he): So the

1054
01:32:30.650 --> 01:32:38.100
David Schaich (he): different colors here are indicated in the temperature of the photons that are coming from

1055
01:32:38.170 --> 01:32:41.310
David Schaich (he): that particular point in this in the sky.

1056
01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:43.070
David Schaich (he): See

1057
01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:45.870
David Schaich (he): onto the screen.

1058
01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:49.840
Good for sure

1059
01:32:52.290 --> 01:32:53.720
David Schaich (he): that

1060
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.230
David Schaich (he): from those photons that are left after accounting for

1061
01:33:05.530 --> 01:33:09.420
David Schaich (he): all. Close by sources of light, like stars.

1062
01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:14.270
David Schaich (he): galaxies. those so called foregrounds.

1063
01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:23.300
David Schaich (he): all it is masked out of the data. There's attractive

1064
01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:28.650
David Schaich (he): photons and our left have a characteristic

1065
01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:33.600
David Schaich (he): range of energy as a function of frequency

1066
01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:37.060
David Schaich (he): that get fit to

1067
01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:40.040
David Schaich (he): It's like spectrum. You determine the temperature.

1068
01:33:40.130 --> 01:33:42.050
David Schaich (he): and they can distract me.

1069
01:33:44.770 --> 01:33:50.420
David Schaich (he): Blue and red colors indicates small fluctuations

1070
01:33:52.570 --> 01:33:55.530
David Schaich (he): around the average temperature.

1071
01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:06.430
David Schaich (he): Oh. you see at the for sure.

1072
01:34:08.110 --> 01:34:13.250
David Schaich (he): at temperature it's 2.7 kelvin round numbers.

1073
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:21.260
David Schaich (he): my small. with the difference in temperature between the

1074
01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:24.890
David Schaich (he): new regions that are cold and the red regions that are hot

1075
01:34:25.370 --> 01:34:30.450
David Schaich (he): in this data is roughly to.

1076
01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:42.020
David Schaich (he): So about 10,000 times smaller than the average, is the scale of the fluctuations that

1077
01:34:43.190 --> 01:34:44.770
David Schaich (he): you are able to resolve

1078
01:34:46.670 --> 01:34:50.340
David Schaich (he): in this case by the like satellite that is

1079
01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:54.600
David Schaich (he): orbiting the earth.

1080
01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.240
David Schaich (he): If you need to measure

1081
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:03.510
David Schaich (he): in turn these fluctuations more precisely.

1082
01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:14.530
David Schaich (he): that is of interest, because that the pattern of fluctuations, how the hot and cool areas are

1083
01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:17.990
David Schaich (he): spread out and mix together in that night sky.

1084
01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:20.120
David Schaich (he): He is

1085
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:23.650
David Schaich (he): one of the

1086
01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.990
David Schaich (he): many pieces of evidence that we have for

1087
01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:30.980
David Schaich (he): the existing properties of what's called

1088
01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:35.920
David Schaich (he): so some source of matter in the universe that does not consist of

1089
01:35:36.250 --> 01:35:38.810
David Schaich (he): animals. That's a. We are made out of.

1090
01:35:39.930 --> 01:35:41.200
David Schaich (he): compose everything but

1091
01:35:42.610 --> 01:35:45.260
studying and interact with on a daily basis.

1092
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:54.580
David Schaich (he): And just as a final illustrator, so like that, I think this particular

1093
01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:02.640
David Schaich (he): temperature distribution of the cost and background is from around 2,015.

1094
01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:16.480
David Schaich (he): So it's just a few years old. The The cosmic background explorer ran. It was an experiment.

1095
01:36:17.070 --> 01:36:18.720
this particular figure

1096
01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:22.730
David Schaich (he): it could be experiments

1097
01:36:26.170 --> 01:36:30.530
David Schaich (he): so slightly older than you are. and it shows

1098
01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:34.510
David Schaich (he): Hi this.

1099
01:36:34.810 --> 01:36:36.100
I'm calling you the data

1100
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:38.650
David Schaich (he): and the fitting that

1101
01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:43.000
David Schaich (he): is carried out. So this is

1102
01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:46.850
David Schaich (he): energy density

1103
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:53.060
David Schaich (he): in particular units, and the function of a frequency in municipal

1104
01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:55.060
David Schaich (he): hundreds of jiggers.

1105
01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:57.490
David Schaich (he): so that

1106
01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:01.150
David Schaich (he): 300 gigahertz is

1107
01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.150
David Schaich (he): roughly

1108
01:37:14.850 --> 01:37:19.850
David Schaich (he): so. The peak in this spectrum here. So the date, the black boxes are

1109
01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:30.440
David Schaich (he): the data points that this currently is measure that more than 30 years ago. It's peak around a frequency

1110
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:33.000
David Schaich (he): 150

1111
01:37:34.090 --> 01:37:36.250
David Schaich (he): jigger Hertz corresponds to.

1112
01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:55.090
David Schaich (he): and the overseas time set frequency. It's 2 angular frequency to circular frequency. c. Is 3, 5 to the eighth meters per second

1113
01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:59.450
David Schaich (he): frequency. Here is the the eleventh inverse seconds.

1114
01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:09.220
David Schaich (he): Seconds cancel the my excuse. and the 8 over 10. The 11 is 10 to the minus 3. It's a factor of

1115
01:38:10.670 --> 01:38:13.650
David Schaich (he): 3. Over 1.5 is 2

1116
01:38:14.370 --> 01:38:15.580
David Schaich (he): millimeters.

1117
01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:25.560
David Schaich (he): which is roughly a 1,000 to 3 orders of magnitude, larger way of then that visible spectrum

1118
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:33.750
David Schaich (he): in particular. This corresponds in the Categorization

1119
01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:41.770
David Schaich (he): Hotel frequencies 2 that microwave

1120
01:38:41.810 --> 01:38:43.750
David Schaich (he): 3 meters.

1121
01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:50.580
David Schaich (he): which is why it's called Yes, cosmic microwave background

1122
01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:00.330
David Schaich (he): the

1123
01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:04.430
David Schaich (he): that was able to measure

1124
01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:07.970
David Schaich (he): from fitting the lifeline to the

1125
01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:11.650
David Schaich (he): data points shown by boxes was.

1126
01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:16.510
David Schaich (he): it's seen, 2.7,

1127
01:39:16.890 --> 01:39:21.640
David Schaich (he): 3, 5, and certainty. 60 of the last 2 decimal places

1128
01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:32.870
David Schaich (he): that has been improved similarly in the past 30 years. as okay appreciate by being able to resolve

1129
01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:41.070
David Schaich (he): fluctuations at the level. So a couple of orders of magnitude

1130
01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:43.590
David Schaich (he): more precise than the uncertainty, so

1131
01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:46.150
David Schaich (he): came out in the 1990 S.

1132
01:39:46.270 --> 01:39:50.300
David Schaich (he): But this, as the first very precise

1133
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:56.050
David Schaich (he): measurements of the temperature of intergalactic space. The

1134
01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:59.190
David Schaich (he): left over cosmic background radiation

1135
01:39:59.210 --> 01:40:04.590
David Schaich (he): of the big bag did receive the mobile price in 2,006

1136
01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:13.170
David Schaich (he): for the first, if not the the final word

1137
01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:14.160
David Schaich (he): on it

1138
01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:18.200
David Schaich (he): Analyses of empty space based on

1139
01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:21.720
David Schaich (he): the play spectrum or a photon gas.

1140
01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:36.320
David Schaich (he): Take away message from this figure, which I think I highlighted. This first of the class is that we are getting

1141
01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:39.170
David Schaich (he): the amazingly accurate

1142
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:45.280
David Schaich (he): descriptions of

1143
01:40:49.150 --> 01:40:56.530
David Schaich (he): physical processes from we call this regions of empty space to how the star is in the Us.

1144
01:40:58.530 --> 01:41:03.260
David Schaich (he): To be amazing aspect of the accuracy. Yeah.

1145
01:41:04.410 --> 01:41:07.450
David Schaich (he): is due to the fact that we should keep in mind.

1146
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:17.530
David Schaich (he): It's an economical partition function. We have it's starting with through these boson signs. Distribution

1147
01:41:19.470 --> 01:41:23.780
David Schaich (he): did begin by assuming we're working with non interactive

1148
01:41:26.210 --> 01:41:37.170
David Schaich (he): ideal particles which it's not true. and the real world but still provides me an excellent description of

1149
01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:40.390
David Schaich (he): observed data, at least, for

1150
01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:42.910
David Schaich (he): i'll stop there.

1151
01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:48.970
David Schaich (he): The final call for questions, and just look ahead to It's coming up tomorrow

1152
01:41:50.810 --> 01:41:56.790
David Schaich (he): pretty quickly. Compute the equation of states from the photon gas and then turn to fermions. There we go.

1153
01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:05.000
David Schaich (he): build into a build up to some of that tutorial or modeling electron

1154
01:42:05.150 --> 01:42:07.070
David Schaich (he): and see some of the

1155
01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:10.400
David Schaich (he): the behavior or good descriptions of

1156
01:42:10.970 --> 01:42:23.020
David Schaich (he): real experimental data based on. I realized statistical physics. the grand economic and ensemble and call them statistics any final questions. Before

1157
01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:26.460
David Schaich (he): there we go All of the day

1158
01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:37.510
David Schaich (he): that case I will stop that recording down.
