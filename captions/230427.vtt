00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.790
David Schaich (he): Okay, it is now time to get underway

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.840
David Schaich (he): with the last tutorial in

3
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.330
David Schaich (he): April, on

4
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.810
David Schaich (he): Thursday the

5
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.460
David Schaich (he): 27th.  The 6-digit code for today is

6
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:33.530
David Schaich (he): 25, 30, 10.  And, as always, we'll start in the usual way and see if there are

7
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.820
David Schaich (he): any questions on your part. While I

8
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.400
David Schaich (he): see if I can

9
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:49.830
David Schaich (he): make the projector here any better visible --- and that actually made things worse.

10
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.160
David Schaich (he): It's making an effort, and that seems to be the best it will

11
00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.610
David Schaich (he): do today.  So,

12
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.720
David Schaich (he): I don't see any questions about the homework due on Wednesday or

13
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.320
other module materials, but

14
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.940
David Schaich (he): I'll also encourage you to speak out if

15
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.480
David Schaich (he): this doc-cam renders what is being projected indecipherable.

16
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.920
David Schaich (he): So the plan for today is a simple one. We introduced last week the

17
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.630
David Schaich (he): I'm. Signed

18
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.560
David Schaich (he): pictures, some materials as here

19
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.440
David Schaich (he): fixed in place by their interactions with their neighbors. So.

20
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.790
David Schaich (he): seeing in the context of the using model. Yeah, focusing on

21
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.660
David Schaich (he): the energy that is stored in

22
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.510
David Schaich (he): links between the nearest neighboring Adams in this south of.

23
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.680
David Schaich (he): Do you.

24
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.650
David Schaich (he): I know the Einstein sol is that we can get a rough but reasonable approximation to

25
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:25.060
David Schaich (he): the behavior of the system in particular. It's experimentally measurable team capacity just by. Suppose they do that

26
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.500
David Schaich (he): quantize units of energy are randomly distributed among them

27
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.610
David Schaich (he): the various oscillators. Yeah. the system, as we saw there are. If they're all right

28
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.950
David Schaich (he): the 3 directions. So there are

29
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.270
David Schaich (he): 3 times a total oscillators, and over and over 3 atoms in a three-dimensional.

30
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.240
David Schaich (he): And we saw last time

31
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.550
David Schaich (he): I'm. Giving you the number of

32
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.410
David Schaich (he): microstates

33
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.010
David Schaich (he): for a system of

34
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.430
David Schaich (he): and oscillators that are sharing. Hey, use of energy

35
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.010
David Schaich (he): it's driving.

36
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.400
David Schaich (he): This microstate accounting is really the trickiest part

37
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.940
David Schaich (he): of the analysis.

38
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.260
David Schaich (he): which is why I give it to you, and I know some of you.

39
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.030
David Schaich (he): and then to office hours to ask

40
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.120
David Schaich (he): where exactly this is coming from.

41
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.910
David Schaich (he): It's something that is difficult to derive

42
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.100
David Schaich (he): if you don't approach it, and

43
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.620
David Schaich (he): in the right way.

44
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.570
David Schaich (he): So.

45
00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.220
folks

46
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.570
David Schaich (he): would I,

47
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:11.980
David Schaich (he): due to a determined number of ways in which hey units of energy can be distributed. I want

48
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.700
David Schaich (he): he's in distinguishable location in the lab. This is

49
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.090
David Schaich (he): what not to do is to say that

50
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.360
David Schaich (he): for each

51
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.400
David Schaich (he): put that into any one of the sort of each unit of energy can be put into any one of the end oscillators.

52
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:42.710
David Schaich (he): so we have it. and possible leaves for each of the K. It's of energy that all get multiplied together

53
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.910
David Schaich (he): independently.

54
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.330
David Schaich (he): and then, because the us of energy are indistinguishable

55
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.330
David Schaich (he): essentially.

56
00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:06.460
David Schaich (he): that are being identify with particular places. In this model we have to correct for it the over accounting

57
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.010
David Schaich (he): the same

58
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.950
David Schaich (he): microstates. If

59
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.340
David Schaich (he): this oscillator here has 2 units of energy. That oscillator there has one unit.

60
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.520
David Schaich (he): What? Whether or not we swap.

61
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.540
David Schaich (he): they won't. Do this here, there, then back around

62
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.340
David Schaich (he): so swapping around the units of energy does not give us any

63
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.530
David Schaich (he): additional microstates, and the over accounting that we have

64
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.540
David Schaich (he): is a very complicated mess.

65
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.770
David Schaich (he): Yes. we also the counter

66
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.940
David Schaich (he): when you motivated chrome statistics, looking at occupation done

67
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.810
numbers of energy levels

68
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.970
David Schaich (he): rather than trying to correct for

69
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.520
David Schaich (he): this over counting whenever multiple oscillators have

70
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.330
David Schaich (he): now 0 units of energy. So yeah.

71
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.580
David Schaich (he): trying to say that approach will lead to a big mess.

72
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.580
David Schaich (he): And

73
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.820
David Schaich (he): the trick that I use

74
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.060
which

75
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.950
David Schaich (he): actually makes this calculation

76
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.460
David Schaich (he): really obvious, we can almost motivate it by looking at the results of

77
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:17.610
backwards.

78
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.570
David Schaich (he): This collection of

79
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.750
David Schaich (he): in the denominator

80
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.250
David Schaich (he): as the binomial coefficients. Oh, choosing hey

81
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.570
David Schaich (he): out of the total k

82
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.370
David Schaich (he): plus and minus one.

83
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.640
David Schaich (he): And

84
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.980
David Schaich (he): the trick that we kidding invoke to

85
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.010
David Schaich (he): explain where this is coming from is

86
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.540
David Schaich (he): interpreting the microstate, accounting

87
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.980
David Schaich (he): It's just

88
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.290
David Schaich (he): equivalent to put in. hey here.

89
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.420
David Schaich (he): indistinguishable

90
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.320
David Schaich (he): into and distinguishable boxes.

91
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.140
David Schaich (he): and we watch your

92
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:28.970
David Schaich (he): accounts. The number of microstates. a number of ways that those balls can be distributed among boxes which we can graphically quick. They know that.

93
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:37.230
David Schaich (he): and it's just a sequence of symbols. Dots for each ball in a vertical line

94
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
David Schaich (he): that is separating each box from the next.

95
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.460
David Schaich (he): So those boxes are distinguishable by the order in which they appear in this sequence

96
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:54.740
David Schaich (he): we're just mapping it three-dimensional structure of oscillators in the lettuce into a straight line.

97
00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:01.310
David Schaich (he): So if we have this would be a equals 4

98
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:08.420
David Schaich (he): because of energy for 4 boxes in this particular microstates.

99
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:17.420
David Schaich (he): It's the one with this energy in the first box and 1 0, and one in the the following 3 oscillators.

100
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.150
David Schaich (he): So

101
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:33.280
David Schaich (he): what we can go here is that the in boxes are determined by the location of those N minus one walls between the boxes.

102
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.850
David Schaich (he): so there are

103
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.470
David Schaich (he): a total of

104
00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.340
David Schaich (he): k plus n minus one

105
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.370
David Schaich (he): symbols

106
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.140
David Schaich (he): in each of these sequences.

107
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:55.500
David Schaich (he): and you just need to choose all possible ways for okay.

108
00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.280
David Schaich (he): to the

109
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.120
David Schaich (he): which gives us already

110
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.170
David Schaich (he): the number of possible sequences is

111
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.460
David Schaich (he): the I know your coefficient. You're after

112
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.350
David Schaich (he): choosing K. Out with the total k plus n minus one symbols

113
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:27.810
David Schaich (he): in the sequence. So you have the 7 symbols for you. All right, free to rolls and 4 rolls

114
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.440
David Schaich (he): in that small example. Okay.

115
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.480
David Schaich (he): this is where we're uncertain about this. We can check all of the

116
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.120
David Schaich (he): simple results that we had

117
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.140
David Schaich (he): n equals 3 with K equals 0,

118
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.430
David Schaich (he): 1, 2,

119
00:09:50.490 --> 00:10:01.130
David Schaich (he): 4, 3 use of energy distributed, and all those 3 oscillators. The cohibition that we're coming up with

120
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:08.180
David Schaich (he): to choose 0 or n minus one is 2. We have K is 0.

121
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.930
David Schaich (he): That just gives one, which is what we

122
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:19.520
David Schaich (he): explicitly. 3 shoes. One is just 3.

123
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:25.650
David Schaich (he): Go up to 4, choose 2 and 5. She is 3,

124
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.160
David Schaich (he): 4 factorial over 2 factorial.

125
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.600
David Schaich (he): and that's 4 times 3, 5 to 2,

126
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.850
David Schaich (he): divided by 4, just gets 3 times 2 to 6. Also what

127
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.530
Explicitly to.

128
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:50.240
David Schaich (he): and then 5 times 4 over 2, it's 10 also

129
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.540
David Schaich (he): what we did

130
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.780
David Schaich (he): exhaustively yesterday. So

131
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.310
David Schaich (he): that's the check that

132
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.040
David Schaich (he): hour.

133
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.000
David Schaich (he): Calculation here is reproducing

134
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.220
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

135
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.500
David Schaich (he): Small test cases that we work with yesterday, and

136
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.240
David Schaich (he): from this we can just

137
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.390
David Schaich (he): going through the

138
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:27.440
David Schaich (he): usual sequence of calculations to determine the temperature

139
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:36.450
David Schaich (he): in terms of the energy invert that to get energy to the function of temperature, and finally take the derivative to and the you capacity.

140
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.660
David Schaich (he): So that inverse temperature is the

141
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.480
David Schaich (he): entropy divided by energy.

142
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.480
David Schaich (he): which

143
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.200
David Schaich (he): the energy is. So it's K. You. That's a

144
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.270
David Schaich (he): So

145
00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.010
David Schaich (he): derivative with respect to K.

146
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.530
David Schaich (he): No rhythm of our

147
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.620
David Schaich (he): so this

148
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:11.650
David Schaich (he): or the K back, or you

149
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:18.990
David Schaich (he): this one factorial and just a little bit of

150
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:24.340
David Schaich (he): you may well have done, based on

151
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:29.280
David Schaich (he): the expression you got at the end of last week. And so.

152
00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.470
David Schaich (he): with a fairly simple expression.

153
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:47.050
David Schaich (he): one plus and minus one over K. And this one is approximately 10 or 4,

154
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.110
David Schaich (he): and much greater than one.

155
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.040
David Schaich (he): If we plug in that K is

156
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.230
David Schaich (he): the energy over H. 10. Beta.

157
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.790
David Schaich (he): This expression tells us that well

158
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.220
David Schaich (he): is

159
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.130
David Schaich (he): inverse.

160
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.640
David Schaich (he): and then inverting that.

161
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:18.940
David Schaich (he): Yes.

162
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:27.530
David Schaich (he): the exponential Beta H. Omega minus one, and then inverse. It's the

163
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.480
David Schaich (he): on the other side.

164
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.190
David Schaich (he): so hopefully integrate it with

165
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:44.060
David Schaich (he): what you and then taking the derivative of that. with respect to

166
00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.060
David Schaich (he): be here.

167
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.200
David Schaich (he): temperature or equivalent with respect to

168
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.020
David Schaich (he): Beta. Let me get it.

169
00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:06.560
David Schaich (he): They slightly messy you expression here. and we have an additional factor of from the chain rule of the denominator along with

170
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.640
David Schaich (he): the numerator.

171
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.740
David Schaich (he): I guess.

172
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:25.850
David Schaich (he): change to the one over X square power.

173
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.400
David Schaich (he): and if I change variables to

174
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.210
David Schaich (he): more convenient.

175
00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.080
David Schaich (he): each. a factor of

176
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:44.370
David Schaich (he): it is squared comes along from that change of variables in the denominator we have.

177
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:51.630
David Schaich (he): and then Beta square h bar squared over the

178
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.510
David Schaich (he): over E to the X minus one squared

179
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.790
David Schaich (he): for that heat capacity.

180
00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.380
David Schaich (he): And

181
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.530
David Schaich (he): so we're essentially done with

182
00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:09.370
David Schaich (he): last week's exercise it is. which is good because there is a good to say about.

183
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.030
David Schaich (he): Oh.

184
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.590
David Schaich (he): how it performs in terms of our goal.

185
00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.150
David Schaich (he): We are you saying the experimental video

186
00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:24.240
David Schaich (he): that we looked at some rather than

187
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.200
David Schaich (he): go back to the smaller picture.

188
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.910
David Schaich (he): We want to see how well this

189
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:37.480
David Schaich (he): X squared in the X over E to the X minus one, squared

190
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.970
David Schaich (he): it scrolls this sort of behavior, so they

191
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:44.480
David Schaich (he): usual starting point is

192
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.380
David Schaich (he): checking the high end of the

193
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.020
David Schaich (he): the whole work.

194
00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.560
David Schaich (he): So start with

195
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.000
little temperature

196
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:03.970
David Schaich (he): minutes.

197
00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.450
David Schaich (he): So

198
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:15.160
David Schaich (he): the C. Goes to 0. That means the inverse temperature is going to infinity. So variable X is going to infinity.

199
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.920
David Schaich (he): the heat capacity per oscillator.

200
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:30.460
David Schaich (he): Should we write the full expression here? X. Squared in the X. You need x minus one squared

201
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.360
It's.

202
00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:48.620
David Schaich (he): So this is approximately X squared into the X over into the X square, which is even 2 x. or just x squared over E to the X, which bases

203
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:54.310
David Schaich (he): exponentially quickly at those temperatures. So

204
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.950
David Schaich (he): yeah, vanishing at low temperatures is

205
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.470
David Schaich (he): that ultimate limit is what we want.

206
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.280
David Schaich (he): And, in fact.

207
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:15.520
David Schaich (he): in all the experimental data of this sort, not just the selection that we're looking at here.

208
00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:22.550
David Schaich (he): the heat capacity at absolute 0 does it go to 0? And this is

209
00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.880
David Schaich (he): one way of phrasing what's called

210
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.359
David Schaich (he): the third of all.

211
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:41.550
David Schaich (he): So in the more town way. the third wall is entropy goes to a constant. and usually, if that goes to 0, and there's a single microscope.

212
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.630
David Schaich (he): it's 0, because we have to discuss

213
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:55.970
David Schaich (he): that turns out to be equivalent based on how we go from the Pennsylvania. Sorry, please.

214
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.650
David Schaich (he): That's your energy

215
00:17:58.810 --> 00:17:59.920
capacity

216
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.760
David Schaich (he): to this result.

217
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:10.310
David Schaich (he): raised in terms of deep capacity, going up to 0

218
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.410
David Schaich (he): in the limit of absolute 0 temperature.

219
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.730
David Schaich (he): Yeah, in the case of

220
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.010
David Schaich (he): this Einstein model of this, how old it

221
00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.290
David Schaich (he): it approaches that limits

222
00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.390
David Schaich (he): exponentially quickly in the inverse temperature

223
00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:30.280
David Schaich (he): which we will come back to after

224
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:42.930
David Schaich (he): looking at the high temperature limits. This was where. if you recall last week. All right. Simple. Oh, I

225
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:49.540
David Schaich (he): just now interacting spins in a magnetic field broke down, and the high temperature limit

226
00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:51.740
David Schaich (he): you look at.

227
00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.130
David Schaich (he): We derived this expression in terms of the

228
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:11.080
David Schaich (he): inverse hyperbolic cosine, and then find that against the temperature we saw that the low temperature limits looked similar to what we just derived from the Einstein solid. The high temperature limit was

229
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.880
David Schaich (he): wildly different than

230
00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:20.130
David Schaich (he): the experimental data points that monotonically increase. totally constant.

231
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.570
David Schaich (he): that distinguishable

232
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.140
David Schaich (he): spin system

233
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.510
David Schaich (he): and runs out of microstates at high

234
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:33.160
David Schaich (he): temperature and the heat capacity that decreases back down to 0

235
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:44.740
David Schaich (he): quadratically rather than exponentially. But something that is completely incorrect, as in as a description of the experimental data.

236
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.400
David Schaich (he): And hopefully.

237
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.980
David Schaich (he): having gone through the work of developing this Einstein model.

238
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.130
David Schaich (he): you'll see better behavior now has

239
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:00.830
David Schaich (he): data and this variable.

240
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:02.690
David Schaich (he): That's

241
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.870
David Schaich (he): each. It's No, it goes to 0.

242
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.250
David Schaich (he): We need to expand that.

243
00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:22.360
David Schaich (he): Our expression for the incident X squared in the excel room. You know the X minus one squared.

244
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.490
David Schaich (he): but we need to do so like you're doing in the homework

245
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.160
David Schaich (he): a careful expansion

246
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.400
David Schaich (he): in case there are cancellations between

247
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.470
David Schaich (he): numerator and denominator here.

248
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.420
David Schaich (he): So what I mean by this.

249
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:46.670
David Schaich (he): This is going to, I guess, a bit beyond what was. It is a task and

250
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.580
David Schaich (he): the tutorial activity. So you might not have

251
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.190
David Schaich (he): well through

252
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.570
David Schaich (he): this exercise

253
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.490
David Schaich (he): the way to

254
00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:03.980
David Schaich (he): compare to the experimental data. but it is worth doing it. not only

255
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.340
David Schaich (he): because of this connection to the whole work

256
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:20.630
David Schaich (he): we expand exponential in the numerator. I will have one plus x plus half a squared higher terms. If the denominator, the ones cancel

257
00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.410
David Schaich (he): within that square, so we'll start with the text.

258
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.820
David Schaich (he): plus one half x squared in the room.

259
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.670
David Schaich (he): and the

260
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:39.650
David Schaich (he): the year X cubed term in the denominator. either with the overall square. What we can do is

261
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:45.550
David Schaich (he): pulled out that overall factor of that and cancel it against the X squared and numerator

262
00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:55.540
David Schaich (he): one plus x plus a half X squared remains in the numerator with higher order terms.

263
00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.880
David Schaich (he): We have.

264
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.800
David Schaich (he): yeah

265
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.700
David Schaich (he): vector of X cool out of that square.

266
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:10.550
David Schaich (he): So

267
00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:16.280
David Schaich (he): the same sort of series with different coefficients in the overall square

268
00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.420
David Schaich (he): as you could expand that square.

269
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.980
David Schaich (he): and then some small X dependent piece that we will eventually

270
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:40.130
David Schaich (he): replace with the geometric series in order to. Yes. numerator and nominator combined

271
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:44.660
David Schaich (he): in terms of powers of our small expansion.

272
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:55.890
David Schaich (he): So here. first term there is the cross term in the square of one. and then X. So 2 times a half gives us just it. X.

273
00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:59.920
David Schaich (he): With the x squared terms we have

274
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:06.150
David Schaich (he): that one half x want to be square. so there's a one over 2, squared it's a quarter.

275
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:07.840
David Schaich (he): and then across term

276
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.370
David Schaich (he): from before 6 X squared

277
00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.070
David Schaich (he): to the wall. So that is

278
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.020
David Schaich (he): 2 over 6 for one third.

279
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.210
David Schaich (he): and then we will have higher order terms that we can.

280
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.580
David Schaich (he): If we At this point we're still working to

281
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.140
David Schaich (he): order. X squared there.

282
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:38.010
David Schaich (he): and turning that one over one plus a small quantity into a your power series. In that small quantity

283
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:55.730
David Schaich (he): you will be able to interpret the.dot.in terms of bigger orientation. At this point the geometric series for the

284
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:56.810
David Schaich (he): and then

285
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.020
David Schaich (he): minus the

286
00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:06.760
David Schaich (he): small quality. So the X plus

287
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:11.980
David Schaich (he): quarter, plus a third, is 3 cross, plus 4, 12 is 7, almost

288
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:16.080
David Schaich (he): x squared. and then that same small quantity

289
00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.440
David Schaich (he): x plus.

290
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.870
David Schaich (he): and then. you know, consistently dropped

291
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.650
David Schaich (he): terms of order. X cubed and higher.

292
00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.470
David Schaich (he): What's your for you. you know.

293
00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:40.340
David Schaich (he): Look at this product term by term. Believe in turn this one

294
00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:53.820
David Schaich (he): at Order X. We have x times one minus one times. X. Those are people with the possibilities there. and with order s squared.

295
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:58.740
David Schaich (he): We have a few possibilities. We have. What have X squared times one

296
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.490
David Schaich (he): we have minus X times. X.

297
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:05.960
David Schaich (he): We have one times 7, 12

298
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.350
David Schaich (he): x squared with a minus sign.

299
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.930
David Schaich (he): and finally the X squared for that term times one

300
00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:22.920
David Schaich (he): is that a factor of one. Then we don't need to worry about Xq for the time being.

301
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.850
David Schaich (he): So what we have at the end

302
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:30.180
David Schaich (he): it's the terms linear in H. Bar Omega over to you

303
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:37.230
David Schaich (he): cancel out our ultimate asymptotic limit is one. and then

304
00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:42.200
David Schaich (he): it's like X squared.

305
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.570
David Schaich (he): I was

306
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:58.210
David Schaich (he): 6, 12, minus 7, 12, which I already wrote without explaining this over to you. Quantity squared. plus corrections that come in

307
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.790
David Schaich (he): at the cubic level in that small parameter.

308
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:13.550
David Schaich (he): So that is the same sort of exercise that comes up. And there you go

309
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:21.490
David Schaich (he): homework, and we can plot it here and see how it looks. What the function

310
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:25.450
David Schaich (he): versus in terms of the inverse temperature, Beta.

311
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:33.780
David Schaich (he): So high temperatures are small. Beta limits. Low temperatures are the large beta. which

312
00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.300
David Schaich (he): looks a lot different than the on some of them, maybe

313
00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:46.720
David Schaich (he): the experimental data that's motivated us. In the first place, we should fought versus

314
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:48.410
David Schaich (he): the temperature itself.

315
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:54.940
David Schaich (he): and as we found at low temperatures an exponential decrease to 0

316
00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:00.650
David Schaich (he): at high temperatures a quadratic approach to

317
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:02.570
David Schaich (he): that upper limit of one.

318
00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:05.770
David Schaich (he): You know, the feed capacity, or oscillator.

319
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.820
David Schaich (he): So this is much

320
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.850
David Schaich (he): more like the experimental data.

321
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:26.760
David Schaich (he): but it's still all short. and the low temperature all right. Small values of the temperature for different materials.

322
00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.790
David Schaich (he): Again. 5 years

323
00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.760
David Schaich (he): as a key capacity divided by temperature.

324
00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.830
David Schaich (he): Apply that against the temperature squared or

325
00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:42.100
David Schaich (he): temperature set all

326
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.720
David Schaich (he): very small, less than about 4 kelvin. So

327
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:52.450
David Schaich (he): 2 squared 16 kelvin squared. we see. hey.

328
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:55.710
David Schaich (he): linear approach to

329
00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.750
David Schaich (he): a non-zero limit. In other words.

330
00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:06.660
David Schaich (he): for you look at

331
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.570
David Schaich (he): low temperature experiments.

332
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:20.660
David Schaich (he): We have the heat capacity over temperature is there constant. and I think I call

333
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.090
David Schaich (he): Alpha then plus, they turn. That is a straight line.

334
00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.320
David Schaich (he): I guess

335
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:37.420
David Schaich (he): t squared. which means that the heat. Capacity itself is a combination of linear. and

336
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:42.920
David Schaich (he): which

337
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.350
David Schaich (he): is not what we found

338
00:28:47.230 --> 00:29:00.590
David Schaich (he): where this exponential approach is much. Pass your approach to video. Ultimately the third of all compared to what experiment shows.

339
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:05.420
David Schaich (he): So we have.

340
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:16.430
David Schaich (he): and half of the tutorial left to set up. explain what is going on with the

341
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.460
David Schaich (he): next activity that fixes this. So the

342
00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:28.190
David Schaich (he): if you where the

343
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.820
David Schaich (he): All shorts at low temperatures

344
00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.970
David Schaich (he): is that didn't real late.

345
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:42.870
David Schaich (he): we decided that

346
00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:49.400
David Schaich (he): we treated it the oscillators. It's completely not interacting

347
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.720
David Schaich (he): tun of the total amount of the energy that's available.

348
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.890
David Schaich (he): It's the temperature decreases.

349
00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:01.430
David Schaich (he): but at the more fundamental level.

350
00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:12.920
David Schaich (he): The purpose of these oscillators is to fix the atoms in place, and Adam starts quickly. It's position, the exert

351
00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.030
David Schaich (he): the force on it to show it back

352
00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:19.860
David Schaich (he): to where it is meant to be.

353
00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:29.620
David Schaich (he): But you know from Newton that the oscillator, exerting the force on that add on

354
00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:34.690
David Schaich (he): means that there is an equal and opposite force exerted by the atom of the oscillator.

355
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.010
David Schaich (he): the other side of the oscillator.

356
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.600
David Schaich (he): and exerted on the neighboring atom.

357
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.350
David Schaich (he): So any we also have in one atom

358
00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.300
David Schaich (he): not only

359
00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:58.460
David Schaich (he): provide some like you, some energy here. It'd be oscillator. But we all spread the wiggly

360
00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.480
David Schaich (he): to

361
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:05.540
David Schaich (he): all of the other atoms that are connected together by those oscillators in order to keep.

362
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:19.540
David Schaich (he): How do you structure of the and 6? So the ultimate issue? Yes, it is the oscillations we have. We're not just

363
00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.420
David Schaich (he): use of energy that can. So here they are

364
00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:32.010
David Schaich (he): across

365
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.450
David Schaich (he): multiple ads

366
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.010
David Schaich (he): in the

367
00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.550
David Schaich (he): What is interactions or correlations here?

368
00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.160
David Schaich (he): Our

369
00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.440
David Schaich (he): so propagating the services

370
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.260
David Schaich (he): that looks like waves.

371
00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:56.380
David Schaich (he): and we

372
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:08.640
David Schaich (he): motion of all of these atoms. and maybe a picture might be worth many words at this point. bye.

373
00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:13.770
David Schaich (he): So I had a picture loaded, but it looks like the

374
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.260
David Schaich (he): here it is

375
00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:18.750
David Schaich (he): all the way somehow.

376
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.760
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

377
00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:27.690
David Schaich (he): get back to canvas.

378
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.440
David Schaich (he): Keyboard is not

379
00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:38.680
David Schaich (he): moment.

380
00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.100
David Schaich (he): Get back to the yeah

381
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.060
David Schaich (he): Pdf for

382
00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.150
David Schaich (he): today.

383
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.510
and we will introduce Dubai shortly.

384
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:11.510
David Schaich (he): This is a picture of this sort of correlated motion. That's

385
00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:13.930
Adams and a selling

386
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:21.140
David Schaich (he): Billy. Okay. in contrast to the outside solid. There is motion that

387
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:32.470
David Schaich (he): goes along as a So here a wave over long distances. spreading across many atoms in the salad.

388
00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:36.850
Okay.

389
00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:40.420
David Schaich (he): try to get out of this now and back to.

390
00:33:49.050 --> 00:34:01.610
David Schaich (he): and the way that it's most convenient to handle this mathematically is to describe these waves in terms of

391
00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:03.930
David Schaich (he): quantized units of energy.

392
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:07.370
David Schaich (he): sure.

393
00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:10.469
David Schaich (he): inspired by

394
00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:13.870
David Schaich (he): the more familiar fact that

395
00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:18.139
David Schaich (he): as we discussed in the lecture, electromagnetic waves

396
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:27.020
David Schaich (he): are describing. my quantum particle is called so from the

397
00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:32.400
David Schaich (he): Hey, I do. These waves are, in fact.

398
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:37.699
David Schaich (he): how sound travels in salads, liquid and gases

399
00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:40.449
David Schaich (he): it can be.

400
00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:47.670
David Schaich (he): and less mathematically. in much the same way as we have analyzed

401
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:51.090
David Schaich (he): gases of photons so like photons.

402
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.920
David Schaich (he): our massless both zones.

403
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:02.980
David Schaich (he): So they obey the ultra relativistic

404
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:09.720
David Schaich (he): energy relation. You know she this place calls and times. Their frequency.

405
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.220
David Schaich (he): They

406
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:16.480
David Schaich (he): travel

407
00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:23.660
David Schaich (he): at the speed of set on there rather than the speed of light.

408
00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:38.510
David Schaich (he): You may know that the speed of sound is many orders of magnitude smaller than the speed of light. hey? Perhaps the more relevant i'll

409
00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.530
David Schaich (he): is that because your

410
00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:50.190
David Schaich (he): call in the motions of added to a solid.

411
00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:51.850
David Schaich (he): they

412
00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.100
David Schaich (he): Hey. cut off on the maximum wavelength.

413
00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:04.780
David Schaich (he): Sorry So minimum wage for the maximum frequency.

414
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.910
David Schaich (he): So for my like, cut off on the energy.

415
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:21.710
David Schaich (he): that minimum wavelengths is just set by

416
00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:32.600
David Schaich (he): another Adams that we have, and this is illustrated now that that was these are a few possible waves that

417
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.750
David Schaich (he): we can describe it as phoneones

418
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.150
David Schaich (he): traveling across these

419
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:43.370
David Schaich (he): many atoms and

420
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.720
David Schaich (he): for responding to the call of the motion. Here.

421
00:36:46.820 --> 00:37:02.600
David Schaich (he): what are you? Low frequency. low of wavelengths behavior when one adds. shifted very far in one directions. Neighboring atoms are shifted along with it.

422
00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:15.420
David Schaich (he): Where is it? The high frequency? Short wave like this? The individual adds, are oscillating counter to each other. and that is the

423
00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:22.570
David Schaich (he): shortest possible wavelength that we can have maximum frequency

424
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:30.260
David Schaich (he): and the the code here. The end is now the total number of atoms in 3 dimensions.

425
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.870
David Schaich (he): So taking the queue root of

426
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:39.520
David Schaich (he): that home, it's a queue root in atoms in each of the 3

427
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.180
David Schaich (he): directions.

428
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.070
David Schaich (he): So

429
00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:53.360
David Schaich (he): the next activity for how many a week it is

430
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.860
David Schaich (he): first to

431
00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.370
David Schaich (he): we do the

432
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.660
David Schaich (he): full time, gas analysis.

433
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:07.510
David Schaich (he): or

434
00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.620
David Schaich (he): so it's a maximum

435
00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.030
David Schaich (he): Pretty well see.

436
00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:18.300
David Schaich (he): and what we want to search for

437
00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:21.360
David Schaich (he): from this analysis

438
00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:24.770
David Schaich (he): again, those

439
00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.400
David Schaich (he): Hi i'm going to

440
00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.030
David Schaich (he): functional forums for

441
00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.240
the capacity.

442
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:49.520
David Schaich (he): also factors since the 3 compared to 2 for just want to see you whether we can get the

443
00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:57.200
David Schaich (he): experimentally observed behavior all right.

444
00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:02.760
David Schaich (he): that in capacity going like a linear plus cubic

445
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:17.980
David Schaich (he): in the end, what you will find is that people i'll tell you the the goal to shoot, for that high temperature should be the same. This is what we kind of like the unassigned cell.

446
00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.210
David Schaich (he): and that looks kind of yours. We should get that.

447
00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:31.830
David Schaich (he): We will not find the hope. One other thing you know here, which is also

448
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:36.110
you

449
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.320
David Schaich (he): in the handout that I can pass around for you to have

450
00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:51.020
David Schaich (he): is that this maximum frequency is related to the temperature.

451
00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.250
David Schaich (he): It is, in fact, just me

452
00:39:55.210 --> 00:40:04.640
David Schaich (he): we can replace it with the temperature, and it constant numerical factor of the which is the sort of that we

453
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:08.210
David Schaich (he): what to ignore when just 34 that a function of 4.

454
00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:11.920
David Schaich (he): Yeah

455
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:14.060
David Schaich (he): to what?

456
00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.270
David Schaich (he): Just go on. That. Put the

457
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.900
David Schaich (he): whole activity out for you

458
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:34.290
David Schaich (he): all at once. And they let you get on with it. having found the Tq. For we are still lacking that in your dependence that dominates at the very low temperatures.

459
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:39.350
David Schaich (he): So what's going on at those very low temperatures

460
00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.000
David Schaich (he): is that there is just

461
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:49.740
David Schaich (he): not enough energy in the solid to excite any of these phone calls

462
00:40:54.160 --> 00:41:01.800
David Schaich (he): frozen in in place and unable to. I guess we can use that word frozen

463
00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:07.310
David Schaich (he): in a fairly liberal sense. Have these very low temperatures.

464
00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:16.310
David Schaich (he): so

465
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:31.230
David Schaich (he): that linear term is not coming from the motion of the atoms? Or is that by these energy and oscillators in the Einstein approach instead?

466
00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:42.380
David Schaich (he): What we saw last week is that a normalistic for me, I guess. has. hey?

467
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:45.570
David Schaich (he): Not 0

468
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:51.120
David Schaich (he): energy expectation going even

469
00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.960
David Schaich (he): as the temperature goes to 0, unlike classical gases, or

470
00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:05.460
David Schaich (he): and this internal. really to

471
00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:07.400
David Schaich (he): the

472
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:11.810
David Schaich (he): keep capacity

473
00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:15.250
David Schaich (he): at low temperatures that we go up to 5.

474
00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:20.030
David Schaich (he): What we need to do when we activity for you comes in

475
00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.190
David Schaich (he): is

476
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:30.150
David Schaich (he): that's the approximation we made in the lecture last week

477
00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:34.950
David Schaich (he): of

478
00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.360
David Schaich (he): approximating the fermi function.

479
00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.750
David Schaich (he): It's just the except function

480
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:55.840
David Schaich (he): turns out to be insufficient that give us a constant energy. So we vanishing heat capacity for all of the

481
00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:58.910
David Schaich (he): approximation.

482
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:04.820
David Schaich (he): these 2 in the very function

483
00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:09.740
David Schaich (he): in the control. This half is

484
00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:11.880
David Schaich (he): to

485
00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:18.900
David Schaich (he): approximate this integral in a different way. So you can recall

486
00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:24.060
David Schaich (he): so propping for numerical factors. Again, it comes to the proportionality

487
00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:29.870
David Schaich (he): fairly function times you do the 3 hands. the e.

488
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:38.280
David Schaich (he): and in order to. if you like this today. A reasonable way.

489
00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.700
Here is a

490
00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:46.210
David Schaich (he): systematic procedure. You can go through.

491
00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.010
David Schaich (he): You first integrated that by parts.

492
00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.560
David Schaich (he): and then argue

493
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.760
David Schaich (he): the only for

494
00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:03.030
David Schaich (he): the year

495
00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:10.930
David Schaich (he): remaining integrated. After integrating my parts.

496
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:13.990
David Schaich (he): shortly peaks

497
00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.100
David Schaich (he): around it

498
00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:24.410
David Schaich (he): the approximately equal to the chemical potential. So

499
00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:41.090
David Schaich (he): til expanding a factor of either the 5 parents that you should show up there around that sharp peak years simpler integrals

500
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:51.540
David Schaich (he): that you can evaluate and plug into. Do you expression for the heat capacity.

501
00:44:53.450 --> 00:45:04.450
David Schaich (he): do you derivative of that? Or she with respect to T. So I haven't given you much time to get started with that today. It is

502
00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:08.610
David Schaich (he): that kind of get through it. Hopefully, these steps are

503
00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:15.710
David Schaich (he): sufficiently clear that you will not too much difficulty going through them

504
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:18.090
David Schaich (he): over the coming week.

505
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.510
We will just have the email

506
00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:26.510
David Schaich (he): one lecture Tuesday afternoon, then back in here next Thursday morning to

507
00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.070
David Schaich (he): see how it got off.

508
00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.220
David Schaich (he): So

509
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:33.580
David Schaich (he): in those last few minutes that we have today. Are there

510
00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.170
David Schaich (he): questions

511
00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:39.090
David Schaich (he): about this setup?

512
00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:41.230
David Schaich (he): 2 tasks here

513
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:48.840
David Schaich (he): to get the low temperature capacity?

514
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:54.890
David Schaich (he): This is based on that

515
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:59.490
David Schaich (he): Einstein's oscillators?

516
00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:21.000
David Schaich (he): Not seeing it immediate questions that you it almost it'll stay plugged in for the next few minutes.

517
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:24.170
David Schaich (he): Shut things down and off

518
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:26.130
David Schaich (he): to the office hours.
