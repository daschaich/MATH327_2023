1
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:10.440
David Schaich (he): Okay, I'll just say a few words now that we're all set up, and I've manage to log into at least a few

2
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.180
David Schaich (he): of these tools.  So

3
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.260
David Schaich (he): I'll come around just after I to a bit of

4
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.490
recording at the start. But just to

5
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:35.020
David Schaich (he): reiterate what I was going on about in an announcement a few days ago: We're about halfway from the start of the computer labs to the deadline for

6
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.080
David Schaich (he): this project. And if you have gotten through those first 3 exercises

7
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.500
David Schaich (he): that's also around the halfway point, and a good place to be.

8
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.960
David Schaich (he): If you're not there yet, then don't worry,

9
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.000
David Schaich (he): there's still plenty of time to catch up.

10
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.240
David Schaich (he): What I'll do today is check if there are general questions about those

11
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.550
David Schaich (he): first 3 exercises

12
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.519
David Schaich (he): deal with pseudo random numbers, inverse transform sampling

13
00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.670
David Schaich (he): and random walks more generally.

14
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:19.020
David Schaich (he): And if you right now just say a few things about the final 2 exercises. the Co. She, Lorenz Distribution.

15
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.230
David Schaich (he): and anomalous diffusion

16
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.720
David Schaich (he): miles of our destination for this project.

17
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.340
David Schaich (he): and not hearing any questions

18
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.260
David Schaich (he): just highlight, a few things that are

19
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.740
David Schaich (he): covered in in this background, material about

20
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:52.620
David Schaich (he): the cost of the Lorentz distribution. one of which is to emphasize that I tell you already here that the central limit theorem will not be applicable to this distribution.

21
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.100
David Schaich (he): and based on what we saw in class, not the central to the

22
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.810
David Schaich (he): we know that the only assumptions it makes

23
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.940
David Schaich (he): mean and variance of the distribution that is providing each single step.

24
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:19.460
David Schaich (he): You know a random walk. What does mean and and variance have to be finite. So this is already a hint about what is going to happen with some of the properties of the the coach. You launch distribution that

25
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.070
David Schaich (he): you're asked to look into.

26
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.210
David Schaich (he): So the plan is, we'll be doing

27
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.750
David Schaich (he): Random walks with step. Size is drawn from It's Koshi distribution.

28
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.360
David Schaich (he): and to get a feel for? Why, this might be interesting. We can

29
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.360
David Schaich (he): just look at the plot of the Kosher distribution with 3 different values of

30
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:53.680
David Schaich (he): it's parameter. B compared to the normal Gaussian distribution some particular value for it's standard deviation, Sigma. in that exponential.

31
00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:05.060
David Schaich (he): But we can see that depending on the the peak of the coaching distribution can either be above or below the Gaussian distribution. But for any value I would be

32
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.060
David Schaich (he): as we get far away from that peak. The Koshi distribution

33
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.770
David Schaich (he): always has a larger probability for a large value of X than the Gaussian distribution.

34
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.510
David Schaich (he): What this is to say is that there is a larger possibility of

35
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.750
David Schaich (he): rare events or extreme

36
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.280
David Schaich (he): steps in the random box will be taking.

37
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:43.600
David Schaich (he): These are also called fat tails. or the tails of the distribution, are referring to the portions far away from its peak. and this is fairly easy to appreciate. From the functional form

38
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.050
David Schaich (he): can see that when

39
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.580
David Schaich (he): X is large this

40
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.980
David Schaich (he): coaching distribution is decreasing like one over X squared, or as the Gaussian distribution

41
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.640
David Schaich (he): is an exponential E to the minus X squared, exponentially suppressed and going t0 0 much more rapidly.

42
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.700
David Schaich (he): So, looking at the task here, when we have the caution distribution and want to find the

43
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.190
David Schaich (he): transform that

44
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.110
David Schaich (he): we'll give us random numbers distributed according to it based on

45
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.210
David Schaich (he): the relation that we talked through last week.

46
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.990
David Schaich (he): We can guess that extracting

47
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.500
David Schaich (he): a f inverse of X,

48
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.830
David Schaich (he): and then inverting it to hit F. Of you. Given that

49
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:43.800
David Schaich (he): the transfer, given the distribution of interest will require integrating both sides, introducing a positive integration that can be fixed by

50
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.690
David Schaich (he): clearly mapping the 2 domains of uniform random numbers

51
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.780
and the coaching distributed random Numbers X

52
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.130
David Schaich (he): onto each other.

53
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.300
David Schaich (he): So that's the the basic procedure to do there, which there were some questions about the

54
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:09.030
David Schaich (he): context of going the other direction in this past week. Given a transformation, taking the derivative to find the corresponding distribution.

55
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.090
David Schaich (he): These 2 plots here are sort of the illustration of why

56
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.020
David Schaich (he): this coaching distribution can be interesting and and possibly tricky to consider.

57
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.860
David Schaich (he): These are 2 random walks here in 2 variables. So.

58
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.150
David Schaich (he): as we take a step, we

59
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.290
David Schaich (he): take that step not only left or right on the line, but at any randomly. It shows an angle around it

60
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.960
David Schaich (he): the complex plane, or just the Xy plane, or generally

61
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:48.790
David Schaich (he): so, we have steps of different lengths and different angles in the plot on the left the step lengths are drawn from that normal Gaussian distribution.

62
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:57.110
David Schaich (he): and in the step in the plot on the right the step lengths are drawn from Akoshi, Lorentz distribution.

63
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.240
David Schaich (he): and the clear difference between the 2 is that

64
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:09.640
David Schaich (he): in the with steps drawn from the Kosher distribution we have occasional steps that are extremely large.

65
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:19.970
David Schaich (he): especially when we look at the different scales on the X and Y. Axes that are about 10 times different between the 2, and see some of these individual steps.

66
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:29.800
David Schaich (he): or traveling farther than a normal random walk that obeys the wall. Diffusion was able to get in a 1,000. So steps all added together.

67
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:45.590
David Schaich (he): due to the in applicability of the central limit theorem. and therefore the inadmissibility of the law of diffusion for the kosher lattice distribution.

68
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:54.370
David Schaich (he): If we want to analyze the final positions of walks with steps draw from that distribution. We actually need to generalize the

69
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.430
David Schaich (he): diffusion length that we have seen before, and are used to just the

70
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.500
David Schaich (he): So if we look at this equation for the generalized diffusion length.

71
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.540
David Schaich (he): I can see that it is

72
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.440
David Schaich (he): operating in the same spirit as the diffusion length, which is the

73
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.520
square roots of the square of that mean.

74
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.490
David Schaich (he): You generalize that instead. Now, to have a

75
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.590
David Schaich (he): real parameter theta is greater than 0.

76
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.120
David Schaich (he): We raise

77
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.300
David Schaich (he): the final position of the walk to the power of theta.

78
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.710
David Schaich (he): take the

79
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:37.590
David Schaich (he): expectation value of the mean, and then take the theta through the one over beta power

80
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.500
David Schaich (he): to

81
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.950
David Schaich (he): put things on a an equal footing.

82
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.040
David Schaich (he): you will find that for the social rest distribution

83
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.490
theta equals 2. Is not.

84
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.070
David Schaich (he): Are you valid value for that parameter we have to use

85
00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.070
David Schaich (he): different values, and for those different values we will find

86
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:08.500
David Schaich (he): that the generalized diffusion length is not proportional to the square root of the number of steps. So it does not obey

87
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:19.930
David Schaich (he): the law of diffusion that we saw in lectures. But there is a real parameter alpha, a exponent in this power law that

88
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:25.220
David Schaich (he): it's not equal to a half. So we don't have the square root. We have either super diffusion

89
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.490
David Schaich (he): or sub diffusion. and yes.

90
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.940
David Schaich (he): part of your task is to figure out which is which.

91
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:38.570
David Schaich (he): and how this Alpha may depend on. Theta So that is

92
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.669
David Schaich (he): reminding me of one last thing to

93
00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:57.670
David Schaich (he): look at before I let you get on with it, which is the piece of the programming demo that we didn't look at last time, and for that matter. I'm also

94
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.170
David Schaich (he): remembering that

95
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.030
David Schaich (he): I forgot to tell you the 6 digit.

96
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:20.410
David Schaich (he): the attendance code for today. which is 9 2 2 2, 1 4 right. Keep that at the top of

97
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.790
David Schaich (he): the demo for a moment.

98
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.830
David Schaich (he): and then hop down to the bottom of the demo. which

99
00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:44.690
David Schaich (he): looks at a trick to simplify the source of power law fits that had arise in the context of a novelist diffusion. But we don't know

100
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:50.050
David Schaich (he): the exponents in the power law, and we want to predict that from numerical data

101
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.700
David Schaich (he): there is a trick

102
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:59.050
David Schaich (he): to extract that first thing. I'll say it is possible to use python just to fit

103
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.950
David Schaich (he): a excellent a power wall directly

104
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.570
giving it. This is the fit function to fit data to.

105
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.770
David Schaich (he): There is a way to simplify this, though, and get back to

106
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.100
David Schaich (he): the sort of thing that you were doing, and exercise 3 for

107
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:21.270
David Schaich (he): a random walk, that they more well behaved with distribution for a step sizes, and that is

108
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:30.040
David Schaich (he): to take the logarithm of both sides of this equation, so that the law of L is equal to the log of C plus alpha times

109
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.180
David Schaich (he): the log of in. So this now is a

110
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.500
David Schaich (he): linear relation

111
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.200
David Schaich (he): between the variables of the logarithm of N.

112
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:47.720
David Schaich (he): And the logarithm of L. For N. Is the number of steps, and L is the distance that the walk travels.

113
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.170
David Schaich (he): This is. it's obvious, if you know, to

114
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.540
David Schaich (he): go through this procedure, it's not necessarily obvious to come up with in the first place.

115
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.720
David Schaich (he): And yeah, the choice is yours whether you want to

116
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.300
apply this trick or

117
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:15.630
David Schaich (he): attempts a direct fit to a power law in the programming solution that you choose for the exercise and these tasks.

118
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:24.390
David Schaich (he): So any general questions about at the remainder of yeah project and Demo.

119
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:35.350
David Schaich (he): not seeing any. All calls the recording for the time being. You get on with things, and also

120
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:46.090
David Schaich (he): Don't. Let me interrupt your work, but I just resume the recording to look into a question that came up about

121
00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.620
David Schaich (he): ways to take powers of numbers in Python.

122
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:57.650
David Schaich (he): There's the observation that in this first exercise

123
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:04.600
David Schaich (he): all of these 5 different are different by it. factor of 10. So you might

124
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:15.620
David Schaich (he): try an elegant way of programming that as 10 to the power. one or power, 2 10 to the 3 4, and 5. So

125
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.410
David Schaich (he): in

126
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.490
David Schaich (he): numerical python

127
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:29.660
David Schaich (he): there is a sub routine called power. which takes

128
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:37.030
David Schaich (he): at least 2 arguments. Here's an example in here with the first argument is

129
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.870
David Schaich (he): the base of

130
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.150
David Schaich (he): the the power, the number that you want reduce to some power.

131
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:51.170
David Schaich (he): and then the second argument is the power to raise that base to. So in this example

132
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:55.850
David Schaich (he): we're looking at 6 different possibilities for that base

133
00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:08.470
David Schaich (he): 0 1 2 3 4, and 5, and raising each of them to the third power. S0 0 cubed is 0 0ne cubed is one. 2 cubed is 8 and s0 0n up t0 5 cubed is 125.

134
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:23.110
David Schaich (he): What you don't want to do is the what might seem natural this upward pointing carrot see? If I can

135
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.720
David Schaich (he): get to Google to search

136
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.190
David Schaich (he): for this explicitly.

137
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.430
David Schaich (he): This is your state

138
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.360
David Schaich (he): random site that came up on the

139
00:13:50.930 --> 00:14:04.170
David Schaich (he): Google Search, and may or may not. There it is this upward pointing arrow. what you might naively write for a power

140
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:16.480
David Schaich (he): is a bitwise exclusive, or operation so representing X and y as some sequences, of 32 0r 64 zeros, and what they're called bits

141
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:30.450
David Schaich (he): that encode the numerical value. This is looking at those 2 numbers bit by bit, in those 32 places applying the exclusive or operation. So the output is one

142
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:42.590
David Schaich (he): here. Either X or Y has a one in that bit location. and it's 0 0therwise that doesn't really matter. Those details. What matters is this? Is not

143
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:43.610
David Schaich (he): the power

144
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.410
Numerical Python has

145
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:53.540
David Schaich (he): the numerical tool that you want to use for this purpose. So that was a nice question that led to some

146
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.400
David Schaich (he): interesting look into the guts of

147
00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:01.830
David Schaich (he): python and the bit wise representation of floating point Numbers

148
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:04.150
David Schaich (he): Good.

149
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:20.330
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Just on Thursday, recording for one more comment that need not interrupt you. But we were talking about in exercise 3, I think, looking at the

150
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:29.570
David Schaich (he): 500 steps in the random walks, or, I should say, random walks of each length up from one step t0 500 steps.

151
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:34.260
David Schaich (he): There's some complaints about that, taking many minutes to to run

152
00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.400
David Schaich (he): on a laptop

153
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.330
David Schaich (he): and making the fan unhappy as we heard it.

154
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:50.430
David Schaich (he): I will say that there are tricks that it's a bit of thought can cut down the amount of time

155
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.710
David Schaich (he): the things safe to run. I think enough. None

156
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.450
David Schaich (he): of these calculations

157
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.910
David Schaich (he): took me more than a minute, even running them on

158
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:10.950
David Schaich (he): that Google cloud. which was about half the speed of my laptop. So it was sort of 20 t0 30 s maximum for any of these exercises on

159
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.780
David Schaich (he): my laptop. But

160
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:18.640
David Schaich (he): if you can't figure out how to speed things up to that extent, the

161
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.940
David Schaich (he): those cloud solutions can also provide a way for

162
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.340
David Schaich (he): things to run for a more extended period of time without

163
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.150
David Schaich (he): taking over your laptop and enforcing its fan to work over time.

164
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:36.690
David Schaich (he): So keep in mind that i'm not trying to make this very yet

165
00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.440
challenging

166
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.960
David Schaich (he): project in terms of the amount of

167
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.600
David Schaich (he): cycles that you're being demanded to burn on the computer.

168
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:48.930
David Schaich (he): It's

169
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:53.000
David Schaich (he): goal is to get you to think about what that computer is doing.

170
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:59.300
David Schaich (he): and how to make it do what you want it to do rather than just work it for hours on end.

171
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:17.369
David Schaich (he): All right. I'm going to wrap things up for this week's computer lab and get things shut down ready for the next class. It will be coming in here in a few minutes, but I do have

172
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:25.160
David Schaich (he): office hour for the next hour and the make up office hours scheduled at 11 0n Thursday.

173
00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:37.120
David Schaich (he): just because I had to leave halfway through the regular one after yesterday's lecture. You're also free to email or make appointments. If you

174
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:44.630
David Schaich (he): continue having difficulties, just keep in mind that with the deadline for the project that

175
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:49.620
David Schaich (he): 5 next Tuesday there will be so much time to wrap things up after

176
00:17:49.770 --> 00:18:02.750
David Schaich (he): the final computer lab next week. So because you make sure you take a first pass, at least at all the exercises before then, and just bring in

177
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.430
David Schaich (he): any immediate questions that have been giving you trouble

178
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.330
David Schaich (he): to wrap up

179
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.320
David Schaich (he): that Tuesday afternoon to get things done. Have a good time.

180
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:25.810
David Schaich (he): so may be in touch over the remainder of the week as infamously. But those are. I don't see till Monday. I hope the rest of the weekend we can go as well. I'll see you then

181
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:32.190
David Schaich (he): next week for the canonical ensemble. The end of the computer project.
