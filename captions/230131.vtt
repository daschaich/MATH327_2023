1
00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.559
David Schaich (he): First let's get the recording under way,

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.160
David Schaich (he): and then switch back to

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.650
David Schaich (he): that.

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.510
David Schaich (he): We can get going

5
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.270
David Schaich (he): with Tuesday the

6
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.049
David Schaich (he): thirty-first of January,

7
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.210
David Schaich (he): and I have a

8
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.730
David Schaich (he): 6-digit attendance code for you:

9
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.500
David Schaich (he): 2, 5, 8,

10
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.029
David Schaich (he): 5, 0, or 3.

11
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.230
David Schaich (he): Let's quickly

12
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.469
David Schaich (he): check that I need to zoom in.

13
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.430
David Schaich (he): And I will say for

14
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.500
David Schaich (he): anyone who is connected to the Zoom Meeting

15
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.900
David Schaich (he): that with the doc-cam set up like this, I'm not going to be able to see any messages in the chat window.

16
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.619
David Schaich (he): So shout out if there are issues,

17
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.300
David Schaich (he): and we'll hope Zoom is connected to the

18
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.879
David Schaich (he): room's audio. Picking up

19
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.939
David Schaich (he): just a day after the first two hours of lecture yesterday, let's do a quick recap to

20
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.649
David Schaich (he): remind ourselves that, in addition to some of the more logistical stuff.

21
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.759
David Schaich (he): Do you

22
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:39.299
David Schaich (he): discussed briefly the the big picture of statistical physics which is going to be the emergence. Large scale behavior.

23
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.059
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

24
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.550
David Schaich (he): arises from

25
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.520
David Schaich (he): the underlying dynamics of

26
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.969
David Schaich (he): many degrees of freedom of the particles.

27
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.199
David Schaich (he): and we started getting under way on the

28
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.300
David Schaich (he): long journey toward that sort of emerging behavior. Things like the arrow of time.

29
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.820
And

30
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.500
David Schaich (he): this doesn't matter I

31
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:12.430
David Schaich (he): going through some fairly formal mathematical definitions of experiments and states and measurements and outcomes

32
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.260
David Schaich (he): key concepts

33
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.890
David Schaich (he): from all of that to

34
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.010
David Schaich (he): here and now is that these measurements.

35
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.900
David Schaich (he): giving us away to

36
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.360
David Schaich (he): extract

37
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.030
David Schaich (he): quantities or

38
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.260
David Schaich (he): numbers really where we can mathematically control

39
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.170
David Schaich (he): a larger scale.

40
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.870
David Schaich (he): Experiments that we do which

41
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.059
David Schaich (he): can actually be doing something. I just

42
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.650
David Schaich (he): observing the state of the universe.

43
00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:11.689
David Schaich (he): imagine a collection of particles, 10 to the power, 23 of them, based on all the gamma's number, just observing them at regular points in time, gives us information about the states of the world. We fill that through the measurements to extract, say, random variables, that

44
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.080
David Schaich (he): we can analyze mathematically

45
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.670
David Schaich (he): the probability here

46
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.890
David Schaich (he): spaces that we defined so

47
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.580
David Schaich (he): collection of

48
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.500
David Schaich (he): all of the possible outcomes of

49
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.430
David Schaich (he): some measurements following some experimental observation.

50
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.510
David Schaich (he): the

51
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.690
David Schaich (he): event space that collects some of those outcomes of interest.

52
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.650
David Schaich (he): and then the probabilities that map every events

53
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.340
David Schaich (he): to a real number between 0.

54
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.360
David Schaich (he): So

55
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.480
David Schaich (he): are there any questions about

56
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.300
David Schaich (he): any of that stuff that we went through

57
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.719
David Schaich (he): last time

58
00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.650
David Schaich (he): you wrapped up

59
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.179
David Schaich (he): yesterday just by

60
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.940
David Schaich (he): defining the

61
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.500
David Schaich (he): mean oops

62
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.790
David Schaich (he): you, which is

63
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.010
David Schaich (he): the expectation value

64
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.609
David Schaich (he): you give them, the

65
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.890
David Schaich (he): outcomes

66
00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.319
David Schaich (he): in the outcome space.

67
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.120
David Schaich (he): The outcome is still

68
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.610
David Schaich (he): by a probability for the current.

69
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.669
David Schaich (he): and similarly the

70
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.570
David Schaich (he): variance

71
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.680
David Schaich (he): call it Sigma Square.

72
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.379
David Schaich (he): gives us the expected value of

73
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.390
David Schaich (he): fluctuations around that meeting

74
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.030
David Schaich (he): You find in the same way the expectation value

75
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.320
David Schaich (he): just being the sum over all outcomes

76
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.270
David Schaich (he): of the quantity of interest

77
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.760
David Schaich (he): to these

78
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.640
David Schaich (he): fluctuations around that meeting.

79
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.530
David Schaich (he): The probability of

80
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.849
David Schaich (he): the outcomes that we are summing over, and the next step

81
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.590
David Schaich (he): Well, today

82
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.739
David Schaich (he): is going to be

83
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.969
David Schaich (he): to build on that.

84
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.550
David Schaich (he): to get to

85
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.270
David Schaich (he): the standard deviation.

86
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.200
David Schaich (he): And then the 2 of the

87
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.679
David Schaich (he): he results that.

88
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:26.620
David Schaich (he): or the underlying reason why it's smooth the merchant Large scale. The 8 of you can arise from random or to

89
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.980
David Schaich (he): dynamics of underlying degrees of freedom.

90
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.059
David Schaich (he): You should get through

91
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.990
David Schaich (he): so-called.

92
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.340
David Schaich (he): should also see the central

93
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.110
David Schaich (he): suspect

94
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:52.650
David Schaich (he): you have seen before, possibly many times so we will just present it in the relevant terms for statistical physics, and i'll bother with

95
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.970
David Schaich (he): a whole derivation of proof.

96
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.080
David Schaich (he): and then sort of

97
00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.789
David Schaich (he): those results

98
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.250
David Schaich (he): in the context of

99
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.890
David Schaich (he): random walks.

100
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.300
David Schaich (he): No well

101
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.309
David Schaich (he): of diffusion

102
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.889
David Schaich (he): which are more interesting than they said.

103
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.530
David Schaich (he): unless they sound very interesting, in which case they are

104
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.100
David Schaich (he): Next.

105
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.700
David Schaich (he): I have space here. I'll keep going.

106
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.629
David Schaich (he): Have you introduced

107
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.790
David Schaich (he): the meeting variance last time.

108
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.700
David Schaich (he): We will also be interested in

109
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.189
David Schaich (he): the standard deviation.

110
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.000
David Schaich (he): Let me give the probability space.

111
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.420
David Schaich (he): This is similarly square rooms

112
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.869
David Schaich (he): of the variance

113
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.290
David Schaich (he): which

114
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.210
David Schaich (he): you can express in

115
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.390
David Schaich (he): possibly

116
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.080
David Schaich (he): familiar with this

117
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.820
David Schaich (he): variance was the expected value of fluctuations

118
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.240
David Schaich (he): around.

119
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.330
so

120
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:06.920
David Schaich (he): is

121
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.719
David Schaich (he): the expected value.

122
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.220
David Schaich (he): Oh.

123
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.399
David Schaich (he): the elements of the outcome set. I'm calling X

124
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.720
David Schaich (he): and expanding that square.

125
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.570
David Schaich (he): It's just giving us the expected value.

126
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.590
David Schaich (he): Oh.

127
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.780
David Schaich (he): hmm!

128
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.610
David Schaich (he): You can be 3 terms from the square for respect to

129
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.420
David Schaich (he): this 2 times.

130
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.630
David Schaich (he): X times the mean we have expected, the only x.

131
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.060
David Schaich (he): and then plus

132
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.680
David Schaich (he): that expected the only self squared, and from the fact that

133
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.429
David Schaich (he): the expectation. Value is a linear operation as we saw last time.

134
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.239
David Schaich (he): It's all pretty so

135
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.419
David Schaich (he): into the

136
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.960
David Schaich (he): that is twice

137
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.090
David Schaich (he): expectation.

138
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.310
David Schaich (he): It's just there

139
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.389
David Schaich (he): constant that the expectation that it doesn't do anything to

140
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.900
David Schaich (he): and overall

141
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.789
David Schaich (he): you know it. Possibly

142
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.150
David Schaich (he): familiar result that the Billings

143
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.160
David Schaich (he): is

144
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:25.590
David Schaich (he): off the screen. The expectation value of the square, minus the square of the expectation value

145
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.989
David Schaich (he): and the standard deviation

146
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.490
David Schaich (he): the cell. Then

147
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:32.799
David Schaich (he): it's just the

148
00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.280
David Schaich (he): square root

149
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.079
David Schaich (he): of that combination.

150
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.620
David Schaich (he): possibly something that

151
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.299
David Schaich (he): you have seen before, and hopefully, not surprisingly.

152
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.730
David Schaich (he): objections to

153
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:50.650
David Schaich (he): a calculation.

154
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.440
David Schaich (he): What we do with this now is

155
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.440
David Schaich (he): start generalizing sort of formal stuff

156
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.889
David Schaich (he): that we went through yesterday with probabilities

157
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.230
David Schaich (he): and consider

158
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.930
David Schaich (he): repeated experiments.

159
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.250
David Schaich (he): So

160
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.650
David Schaich (he): you take

161
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.960
David Schaich (he): the experiments that we've been talking about so far.

162
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.930
David Schaich (he): and we define

163
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.889
David Schaich (he): a new experiments.

164
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.040
David Schaich (he): Yes.

165
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.750
David Schaich (he): simply

166
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.029
David Schaich (he): repeats this. The

167
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.210
David Schaich (he): some number of times.

168
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.010
David Schaich (he): Call that number R:

169
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.079
David Schaich (he): our repetitions.

170
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.689
David Schaich (he): The experiment. Yeah.

171
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.500
David Schaich (he): that experiment has

172
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:43.530
David Schaich (he): the outcome space.

173
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.680
David Schaich (he): You've been talking about a

174
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.350
David Schaich (he): and the

175
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:48.820
David Schaich (he): outcome space

176
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.680
David Schaich (he): of the repeated

177
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.250
David Schaich (he): new experiments.

178
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.590
David Schaich (he): what we call it the

179
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.530
David Schaich (he): the next letter available.

180
00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.489
David Schaich (he): So if we

181
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.509
David Schaich (he): go back to the example that we have

182
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.249
David Schaich (he): when we had a

183
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.470
David Schaich (he): find out out from space

184
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.140
David Schaich (he): the outcome is exporting X to

185
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.150
David Schaich (he): X in.

186
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:18.290
David Schaich (he): and if we illustrations that are to be 4,

187
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.370
David Schaich (he): what are

188
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.470
David Schaich (he): so? The outcomes that we can expect to

189
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:28.260
David Schaich (he): be in the outcome space be on this new experiment of the piece

190
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.100
David Schaich (he): the original spirits

191
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.570
David Schaich (he): 4 times

192
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.709
David Schaich (he): right again. Now

193
00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:09.830
David Schaich (he): exactly so.

194
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.139
David Schaich (he): for example that could be

195
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.910
David Schaich (he): Yeah. The first time the experiment is repeated we get out coming X one.

196
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.910
David Schaich (he): the second repetition

197
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.550
David Schaich (he): next one

198
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.940
David Schaich (he): third repetition here's Outcome X. One

199
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.340
David Schaich (he): for repetition

200
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.570
David Schaich (he): next one

201
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:34.080
David Schaich (he): that is one possible outcome in our new outcome space of the repeated experiment.

202
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.660
David Schaich (he): let's see

203
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.420
David Schaich (he): possibly simple one

204
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.080
David Schaich (he): could it as well. It's not

205
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.530
David Schaich (he): 47

206
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:49.729
David Schaich (he): from X 73. I'll come next one, and maybe that last

207
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.759
David Schaich (he): many more of these all characterized as you said, my

208
00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:57.610
David Schaich (he): 4 outcomes of that original experiment.

209
00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:04.980
David Schaich (he): So with that the size of a the number of elements in a

210
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.320
David Schaich (he): Yes, and

211
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:15.860
David Schaich (he): we can tell that the size of the is going to be much larger

212
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.779
David Schaich (he): for each revision. You will have

213
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.970
David Schaich (he): all in possibilities. Okay, original experiments

214
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.159
coming out

215
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.819
David Schaich (he): those outcomes.

216
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.769
David Schaich (he): The next repetition you get another.

217
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.180
David Schaich (he): and so on.

218
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.860
David Schaich (he): Our times.

219
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.930
David Schaich (he): The total number of elements in

220
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.179
David Schaich (he): the outcome Space B of this new repeated experiment

221
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:43.190
David Schaich (he): is

222
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.730
David Schaich (he): into the power R:

223
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.360
David Schaich (he): so it is

224
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.260
David Schaich (he): exponentially larger.

225
00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.270
David Schaich (he): Then

226
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.780
David Schaich (he): the original

227
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.130
David Schaich (he): outcome space area.

228
00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:00.680
David Schaich (he): unless I suppose we have a situation where the out and they say it was all continuous. That's a possibility.

229
00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.310
David Schaich (he): and then it becomes

230
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:03.650
David Schaich (he): all right.

231
00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.029
David Schaich (he): Those are possibilities.

232
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.159
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Well.

233
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.180
David Schaich (he): for any given outcome.

234
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:21.840
David Schaich (he): let's call it X.

235
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.540
David Schaich (he): I. J. K.

236
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.970
David Schaich (he): Are

237
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.320
David Schaich (he): outcomes of the repeated experiments

238
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.100
David Schaich (he): all combined together.

239
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.680
David Schaich (he): Yes, that's some element of B.

240
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.420
David Schaich (he): The

241
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.469
David Schaich (he): characteristics for the properties of this of these repeated outcomes

242
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.900
David Schaich (he): I want to be

243
00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.550
David Schaich (he): determined

244
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.290
David Schaich (he): by

245
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.380
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

246
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.589
David Schaich (he): Our outcomes

247
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.210
David Schaich (he): superscripts are in parentheses.

248
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:10.810
David Schaich (he): It's clear that that's not a power. It's just a label. There are these outcomes in a and putting them together is giving us any outcome.

249
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.010
David Schaich (he): You can be.

250
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.290
David Schaich (he): and

251
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.550
David Schaich (he): in particular.

252
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.909
David Schaich (he): if we have the mean and variance

253
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:24.580
David Schaich (he): of these single experiments for single repetition experiments.

254
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.200
David Schaich (he): so each outcome, and a

255
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.270
David Schaich (he): because so many you.

256
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:31.600
David Schaich (he): It is

257
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.620
David Schaich (he): that various.

258
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.430
David Schaich (he): See on the square

259
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.980
David Schaich (he): we can expect the

260
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.629
David Schaich (he): these properties New and Sigma squared

261
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.440
David Schaich (he): on the

262
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.010
David Schaich (he): now familiar with the outcome, set a to govern

263
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.490
David Schaich (he): the 80. Or

264
00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:57.540
David Schaich (he): this outcome said, be, or even I should say it more generally space

265
00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.670
David Schaich (he): if we think about the probability

266
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.309
David Schaich (he): based on the outcome of the of this repeated experiment.

267
00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:04.340
David Schaich (he): Oh.

268
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.609
David Schaich (he): one of these outcomes.

269
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.129
David Schaich (he): this this

270
00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:15.490
David Schaich (he): X I. X. K. And excel.

271
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.069
David Schaich (he): that brings up

272
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.150
David Schaich (he): into the product

273
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:27.230
David Schaich (he): of the probability coming from the probability space of the original, the original

274
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.159
David Schaich (he): of getting outcome, I one time

275
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.600
David Schaich (he): the single experiment

276
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.380
David Schaich (he): for the next. J.

277
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.600
David Schaich (he): Similarly, for

278
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.860
David Schaich (he): however many calls the experiment

279
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:43.990
David Schaich (he): is repeated.

280
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.869
David Schaich (he): What we can do.

281
00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.790
David Schaich (he): thanks to

282
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.089
David Schaich (he): this

283
00:15:52.280 --> 00:16:00.880
David Schaich (he): fact that the repeated experiments is being determined by the experiment being repeated that way hopefully sounds intuitive.

284
00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.480
David Schaich (he): We can consider the

285
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.759
David Schaich (he): the arithmetic mean.

286
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.200
David Schaich (he): Oh.

287
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.970
David Schaich (he): the individual outcome of X.

288
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.629
David Schaich (he): So that's the next bar.

289
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:24.370
David Schaich (he): and for this subscript on this is to indicate that the name

290
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.710
David Schaich (he): we are considering. It is something over.

291
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.969
David Schaich (he): Those are repetitions of that experiment.

292
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.579
David Schaich (he): and then averaging over the sum.

293
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:37.960
David Schaich (he): i'll be.com.

294
00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.020
David Schaich (he): Oh.

295
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.050
David Schaich (he): each of those experiments being repeated.

296
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.280
David Schaich (he): So

297
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.310
David Schaich (he): we've discussed that

298
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.460
David Schaich (he): the

299
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.120
David Schaich (he): individual outcome.

300
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.710
David Schaich (he): This X of R is so

301
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.700
David Schaich (he): are

302
00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.669
David Schaich (he): is a random variable of our.

303
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:15.259
David Schaich (he): The arithmetic mean that we have here which collects together all our repetitions in that experiment is itself a random variable.

304
00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:20.609
David Schaich (he): but it is

305
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:29.360
David Schaich (he): now, I think it because it involves all of the repetitions of the experiment. It's a random variable. I' that repeated experiment

306
00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.600
connected to

307
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:34.770
David Schaich (he): the

308
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.459
David Schaich (he): much larger app from space.

309
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.870
David Schaich (he): So every time we repeat

310
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.689
David Schaich (he): the original experiment our lines.

311
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:48.210
David Schaich (he): you will get some

312
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:52.720
David Schaich (he): based on the random fluctuations of the original experiments

313
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.970
David Schaich (he): be repeated. Those are times

314
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:59.040
David Schaich (he): so repeating. The new

315
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:04.000
David Schaich (he): gives us random values for this arithmetic meeting. X Bar.

316
00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:05.900
David Schaich (he): It depends on

317
00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.409
David Schaich (he): are the number of repetitions. How many times

318
00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:14.059
David Schaich (he): that that original experiment there's lots of repetition in

319
00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.149
David Schaich (he): at the

320
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.940
David Schaich (he): layers of

321
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.110
David Schaich (he): of different

322
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.540
David Schaich (he): clear.

323
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:27.579
David Schaich (he): and what we can do now.

324
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:29.540
David Schaich (he): it is

325
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.980
David Schaich (he): 2,

326
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:36.870
David Schaich (he): you

327
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.279
David Schaich (he): of just the single

328
00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.450
David Schaich (he): experiment.

329
00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:46.739
David Schaich (he): so long as we assume

330
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.080
David Schaich (he): first step that

331
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.360
David Schaich (he): the

332
00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.430
David Schaich (he): what is this fine?

333
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.200
David Schaich (he): And we also

334
00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.430
David Schaich (he): I'll be you

335
00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.949
David Schaich (he): single experiment you

336
00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.390
David Schaich (he): and Sigma Square of.

337
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.020
David Schaich (he): and that

338
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.100
David Schaich (he): the way we will do this

339
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:23.850
David Schaich (he): relation.

340
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.590
David Schaich (he): It's 2.

341
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.240
David Schaich (he): See what I can put on me

342
00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.749
David Schaich (he): screen there. At the same time

343
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.790
David Schaich (he): you will consider a particular

344
00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.520
David Schaich (he): expectation value.

345
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.780
David Schaich (he): Now, coming over this refused experiment.

346
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.610
David Schaich (he): We have the

347
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:52.170
David Schaich (he): difference between the arithmetic meeting based on our repetitions

348
00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:54.630
David Schaich (he): and the

349
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.880
David Schaich (he): truly view of the single experiments that we started off with

350
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.970
David Schaich (he): just plug in the definition of that.

351
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.519
David Schaich (he): It's going to be one over our

352
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:11.850
David Schaich (he): something over

353
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.840
David Schaich (he): on the single experiment outcomes

354
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.740
David Schaich (he): and still attracting

355
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.560
David Schaich (he): constant single experiment. Me.

356
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.790
David Schaich (he): Let's see what we can say about

357
00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.930
David Schaich (he): this expectation. Now

358
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.620
you first is pull out

359
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:41.589
David Schaich (he): again. Expectation values in your operation. One over r is a constant with the fixed number of repetitions.

360
00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.559
David Schaich (he): So which is

361
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.840
David Schaich (he): It's pulled out the

362
00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.800
David Schaich (he): expectation value squared along the way.

363
00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.800
David Schaich (he): and

364
00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:50.860
David Schaich (he): we can

365
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.750
David Schaich (he): do a little trick. So, pulling out

366
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.020
David Schaich (he): the

367
00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:00.689
David Schaich (he): one over all those terms will give us

368
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.179
David Schaich (he): our times new within the square.

369
00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.629
David Schaich (he): We can notice that this is just

370
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.610
David Schaich (he): what we would get from something the constants mean you

371
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.079
David Schaich (he): our times.

372
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.979
David Schaich (he): so we can combine

373
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.520
David Schaich (he): the

374
00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.410
David Schaich (he): 2 terms here.

375
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.770
David Schaich (he): and in the

376
00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.350
David Schaich (he): consider the difference

377
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.630
David Schaich (he): minus the

378
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.120
David Schaich (he): and then

379
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.959
David Schaich (he): so just

380
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:44.110
David Schaich (he): make sure that all of the parentheses lined up. It is the sum itself.

381
00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.169
David Schaich (he): And now each term in the cell has this difference

382
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.929
David Schaich (he): between the outcome X and the mean mute.

383
00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.580
David Schaich (he): of course, swearing things.

384
00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.620
David Schaich (he): It's the same as

385
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.120
David Schaich (he): multiplying them

386
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.130
David Schaich (he): by themselves.

387
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.159
David Schaich (he): When you do that we can just change

388
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.590
David Schaich (he): There it is

389
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.850
David Schaich (he): to say that you are summing over

390
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:17.739
David Schaich (he): S rather than something over R. It's a fairly

391
00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.310
David Schaich (he): pretty.

392
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.640
David Schaich (he): and

393
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.179
David Schaich (he): this sort of makes it clear that

394
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.710
David Schaich (he): you can plug in some

395
00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.140
David Schaich (he): hopefully familiar

396
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.270
David Schaich (he): arithmetic.

397
00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.680
David Schaich (he): The product of 2 songs

398
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.550
David Schaich (he): call something over. I and J

399
00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.370
David Schaich (he): is the same as the some of the combined

400
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:48.790
David Schaich (he): bye

401
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:49.990
David Schaich (he): counting

402
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:53.460
David Schaich (he): of all those possibilities. So this is

403
00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.750
David Schaich (he): the distributive.

404
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.800
David Schaich (he): and it allows us to

405
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.830
David Schaich (he): right

406
00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.739
David Schaich (he): our expectation down

407
00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.509
David Schaich (he): as a single cell

408
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.960
David Schaich (he): over both of this R. And S.

409
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.540
David Schaich (he): Of the product.

410
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.109
David Schaich (he): The fluctuations you are

411
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.199
David Schaich (he): around that meeting.

412
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:20.670
David Schaich (he): The fluctuations of S

413
00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.160
David Schaich (he): around that meeting.

414
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:27.510
David Schaich (he): Now

415
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.579
David Schaich (he): what we would have had is that

416
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.420
David Schaich (he): we had the same as here. We could recognize

417
00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:37.639
David Schaich (he): this expectation. Value is related to

418
00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.420
David Schaich (he): variance of the you

419
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:42.590
David Schaich (he): single experiment.

420
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.970
David Schaich (he): The

421
00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.910
David Schaich (he): check this over here

422
00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.529
the expectation value

423
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.790
David Schaich (he): of X minus u squared.

424
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:58.590
David Schaich (he): which is the sum over all the outcomes weighted by probabilities.

425
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.810
David Schaich (he): Okay, X minus me squared.

426
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.630
David Schaich (he): But we don't. We get that very when all this

427
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.829
David Schaich (he): all the same.

428
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.190
David Schaich (he): so we can put in.

429
00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.790
David Schaich (he): you know, chronic or delta.

430
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.169
David Schaich (he): Delta. R. S.

431
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:19.550
David Schaich (he): Is chronic, or you know, familiar piece of that radical notation

432
00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:20.959
David Schaich (he): that's one

433
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:24.040
David Schaich (he): when R equals S. And 0 otherwise.

434
00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.350
David Schaich (he): and

435
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:28.880
David Schaich (he): what we have

436
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:33.660
David Schaich (he): at this point the variance Sigma is another constant that comes out with

437
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:36.770
David Schaich (he): expectation down

438
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.560
David Schaich (he): the expectation that only still

439
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:41.940
David Schaich (he): is, in fact, not just

440
00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.829
David Schaich (he): acting on

441
00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.120
David Schaich (he): some for all of us.

442
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.070
David Schaich (he): A Delta Rs.

443
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.540
David Schaich (he): We pick out.

444
00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.650
David Schaich (he): We set our equals to S. That Delta becomes one.

445
00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.229
David Schaich (he): and we still have

446
00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.499
David Schaich (he): some over the other

447
00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.300
David Schaich (he): of those variables.

448
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.250
David Schaich (he): Our our terms in that some.

449
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.889
David Schaich (he): So Sigma Square

450
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.400
David Schaich (he): over Our Square

451
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.750
David Schaich (he): all the

452
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.120
David Schaich (he): or simply

453
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.820
David Schaich (he): the various divided.

454
00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.670
Oh.

455
00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:25.549
David Schaich (he): so we resume that that variance is, Find it

456
00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.030
David Schaich (he): if we

457
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:28.550
David Schaich (he): look at the

458
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.090
David Schaich (he): minutes.

459
00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:34.930
David Schaich (he): but all going to infinity, we have a finite number

460
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.849
David Schaich (he): if I

461
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:42.120
David Schaich (he): so this overall expression that we started off, with which just barely fits up the

462
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.749
David Schaich (he): projection, there

463
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.269
David Schaich (he): we can sell. The limits of are going to infinity

464
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:53.970
David Schaich (he): vanishes.

465
00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.300
David Schaich (he): which is interesting.

466
00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:57.710
David Schaich (he): You have this.

467
00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.510
So

468
00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:06.170
David Schaich (he): all those

469
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:07.959
David Schaich (he): no problems

470
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.050
David Schaich (he): across the

471
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.180
David Schaich (he): repeated experiments waited by

472
00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:17.209
David Schaich (he): the probability of probably is a not negative number between 0 and one.

473
00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:22.979
David Schaich (he): Each of these terms is a square. So it's also.

474
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:23.880
Yeah.

475
00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.299
David Schaich (he): So we have a cell

476
00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.939
David Schaich (he): products of non-negative numbers that are all adding up to 0.

477
00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.909
David Schaich (he): The only way that could happen

478
00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:32.760
David Schaich (he): is it every single one of them

479
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.720
David Schaich (he): 0, that some?

480
00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.100
David Schaich (he): So

481
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.640
David Schaich (he): let's see.

482
00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.450
David Schaich (he): Put that down.

483
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.100
David Schaich (he): Austerity.

484
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.189
David Schaich (he): Yeah, concluded that every term

485
00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:57.749
David Schaich (he): in the expectation value here is 0,

486
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.830
David Schaich (he): which, if we

487
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:03.070
David Schaich (he): at least we have limits for the number of repetitions

488
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.750
David Schaich (he): it goes to infinity.

489
00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:07.720
David Schaich (he): We have

490
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.840
David Schaich (he): the arithmetic mean

491
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:17.380
David Schaich (he): minus the being. A single experiment. Distribution.

492
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.080
David Schaich (he): Each of those has to equals 0,

493
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.289
David Schaich (he): which we can

494
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.380
David Schaich (he): rearrange

495
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:27.750
David Schaich (he): is to say that that arithmetic mean

496
00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:30.650
David Schaich (he): to

497
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:39.829
David Schaich (he): the the of the true mean of the original capability distribution in the of a large number of repetitions.

498
00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.309
David Schaich (he): And this is

499
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:45.910
David Schaich (he): yeah.

500
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.809
David Schaich (he): so called law large numbers.

501
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.480
Yes.

502
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.340
David Schaich (he): I promise we would get through today

503
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:55.410
David Schaich (he): the statement that.

504
00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.620
David Schaich (he): as we have a large number of repetitions.

505
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.249
David Schaich (he): we don't necessarily need to worry about

506
00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:08.650
David Schaich (he): the true mean of the probability space which is computed by

507
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:13.509
David Schaich (he): averaging over a computer by considering every single possible outcome.

508
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.740
David Schaich (he): Oh, yes.

509
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.809
experiments and measurement which could well be

510
00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.410
David Schaich (he): uncountably infinite.

511
00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.669
David Schaich (he): What we can do just do is repeat the experiments.

512
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.530
David Schaich (he): A large number of times

513
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.470
David Schaich (he): average over the results.

514
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.850
David Schaich (he): and that's for sure that's the

515
00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.510
David Schaich (he): is reflecting the true

516
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.570
David Schaich (he): features of the probability space

517
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:39.950
David Schaich (he): in particular. It's

518
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.489
meeting that you

519
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.310
David Schaich (he): any questions about

520
00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.870
David Schaich (he): either this conclusion or

521
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:59.060
David Schaich (he): the calculation that led to it, based on the concept of repeating experiments, multiple times.

522
00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.790
David Schaich (he): shaking hands to the next

523
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:09.990
David Schaich (he): target.

524
00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.490
David Schaich (he): For today

525
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.120
David Schaich (he): we should be able to get through is going to be just a segment of the Central.

526
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:19.650
David Schaich (he): and in order to

527
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:22.099
David Schaich (he): get to that.

528
00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:24.579
David Schaich (he): we we will see that the

529
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.190
David Schaich (he): central.

530
00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.070
David Schaich (he): probably

531
00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.790
David Schaich (he): distribution

532
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.950
David Schaich (he): a slow generalization.

533
00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:37.200
David Schaich (he): Oh.

534
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:41.160
David Schaich (he): the probability spaces that we have looked at so far.

535
00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.739
David Schaich (he): We've said before that

536
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:49.529
David Schaich (he): the outcome sets we consider it

537
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.790
David Schaich (he): as this would have been

538
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.059
David Schaich (he): finite sets

539
00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:57.879
David Schaich (he): talking about. I have a company illustration like here

540
00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.020
we just

541
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:00.640
David Schaich (he): accountable number

542
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.700
David Schaich (he): in this case a finite number of outcomes.

543
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.490
David Schaich (he): I mean. You have

544
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.730
David Schaich (he): the possibility of

545
00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.019
David Schaich (he): continuous outcome of X

546
00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:14.570
David Schaich (he): any uncountable

547
00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.909
David Schaich (he): out from Space Day

548
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:26.969
David Schaich (he): that all of these discrete sounds that we've had in all we're talking about expectation values

549
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:28.180
David Schaich (he): to be

550
00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.770
David Schaich (he): generalized

551
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:30.760
David Schaich (he): to

552
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.180
David Schaich (he): integrals

553
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:38.200
David Schaich (he): just as

554
00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:43.779
David Schaich (he): all this many years ago.

555
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:45.980
David Schaich (he): So

556
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:47.909
David Schaich (he): but we have them.

557
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:49.420
David Schaich (he): is

558
00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:51.920
David Schaich (he): the probability, distribution.

559
00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.040
David Schaich (he): what

560
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.960
David Schaich (he): we also call probability

561
00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.320
David Schaich (he): density

562
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:00.509
David Schaich (he): that has to be

563
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.920
David Schaich (he): integrated

564
00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.310
David Schaich (he): in order to

565
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.630
David Schaich (he): you have the source of probabilities that

566
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.260
David Schaich (he): you've been talking about so far.

567
00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:22.909
David Schaich (he): So maybe it's just easy to to write down

568
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:25.219
David Schaich (he): mathematical statement that goes along with

569
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:27.699
David Schaich (he): all of these words, that the probability

570
00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:30.279
David Schaich (he): of having an outcome X.

571
00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:31.540
David Schaich (he): And so

572
00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.429
David Schaich (he): range of this

573
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.300
David Schaich (he): continuous

574
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.419
David Schaich (he): space of possibilities, so in between

575
00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:39.900
David Schaich (he): A and B

576
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:40.840
David Schaich (he): is the

577
00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.670
David Schaich (he): integral from a to the

578
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:53.520
David Schaich (he): as a continuous function of a lowercase, X.

579
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:54.710
David Schaich (he): And so

580
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:57.469
David Schaich (he): it's just a real number.

581
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.360
David Schaich (he): So, rather than having a accountable set

582
00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:07.039
David Schaich (he): of outcomes, each of which has a probability.

583
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:12.319
David Schaich (he): We have to talk about the probability that our continuous outcome, or to use X

584
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.760
David Schaich (he): is in

585
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:20.869
David Schaich (he): well to find that range region a to B, which could be even accessible

586
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:26.340
David Schaich (he): just in a way that capitalist allows us to consider

587
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:30.820
David Schaich (he): things like expectation values

588
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.560
David Schaich (he): also generalized

589
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.940
David Schaich (he): for probability distributions.

590
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:39.839
David Schaich (he): So the expectation

591
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.450
David Schaich (he): general function of these continuous outcomes

592
00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.560
David Schaich (he): is now

593
00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:45.860
David Schaich (he): the integral

594
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:47.639
David Schaich (he): over that function.

595
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.819
David Schaich (he): we by the

596
00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.290
David Schaich (he): and

597
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.010
David Schaich (he): if I don't have that

598
00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:56.609
David Schaich (he): upper over limits.

599
00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.529
David Schaich (he): It is a goal

600
00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:01.210
David Schaich (he): there.

601
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.270
David Schaich (he): It will personally be integrating over the

602
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.610
David Schaich (he): whole range

603
00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:13.909
David Schaich (he): of X. So, as one example, we look at the expectation value.

604
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:14.850
David Schaich (he): Oh.

605
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.000
David Schaich (he): number one!

606
00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:24.940
David Schaich (he): Just one times I get to go over the probability across this whole range.

607
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:26.909
David Schaich (he): which, by the definition

608
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:30.190
David Schaich (he): of probabilities as a measure function.

609
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:31.379
David Schaich (he): It's just

610
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.990
David Schaich (he): 100%

611
00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.910
David Schaich (he): hopefully sensible that

612
00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:43.300
David Schaich (he): some people are integrating over all of the possibilities for a probability

613
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.720
David Schaich (he): gives 100% to you at

614
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:48.460
David Schaich (he): a year.

615
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.150
David Schaich (he): If there is an outcome in that whole range.

616
00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.870
David Schaich (he): For things like

617
00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.200
David Schaich (he): the mean of various.

618
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.720
David Schaich (he): you have a

619
00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.580
David Schaich (he): of expectation functions.

620
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.040
David Schaich (he): So the integral

621
00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.249
David Schaich (he): of X to some power. L.

622
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:07.470
David Schaich (he): We.

623
00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.450
David Schaich (he): This continuous probability density.

624
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:13.579
David Schaich (he): when L equals one.

625
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.240
David Schaich (he): just pick up

626
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.890
David Schaich (he): the mean

627
00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.380
David Schaich (he): you with the expectation on the X

628
00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:27.159
David Schaich (he): variance only requires

629
00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:28.790
David Schaich (he): considering

630
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:35.429
David Schaich (he): in case L equals 2 in addition to

631
00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:37.069
David Schaich (he): that means. So

632
00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:43.459
David Schaich (he): that really is all that we need just to state

633
00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:47.220
David Schaich (he): at least the 4, 1, 8 central, that 0

634
00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:52.850
David Schaich (he): hold in for

635
00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.399
David Schaich (he): this molecule.

636
00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:57.049
David Schaich (he): So I should say.

637
00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:58.800
David Schaich (he): going into

638
00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.529
David Schaich (he): this relatively brief statement that

639
00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.949
David Schaich (he): there are lots of variations in the central limit here that

640
00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:09.959
David Schaich (he): with different situations for context, there are lots of ways to prove them

641
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.619
David Schaich (he): you won't. Be going into any of those

642
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:20.109
David Schaich (he): form of this.

643
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:21.380
David Schaich (he): applying this

644
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.109
David Schaich (he): to

645
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:24.729
David Schaich (he): various

646
00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:26.810
David Schaich (he): applications

647
00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:28.060
David Schaich (he): started all

648
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:31.640
David Schaich (he): most likely through Thursday's tutorial.

649
00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:40.600
David Schaich (he): Analyze that, you know, like an example. We the that we talked about yesterday

650
00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.459
David Schaich (he): to that place.

651
00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:47.910
David Schaich (he): So, without further ado.

652
00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:53.820
David Schaich (he): we will define our State the central limit for a while.

653
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.549
David Schaich (he): considering and

654
00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.700
David Schaich (he): random variables

655
00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:02.509
David Schaich (he): which.

656
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:06.140
David Schaich (he): and call X one to

657
00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:08.930
David Schaich (he): X in the usual way

658
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:10.620
David Schaich (he): and

659
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.330
David Schaich (he): the clearing that

660
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.089
David Schaich (he): in addition.

661
00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:16.899
David Schaich (he): each of these and

662
00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:19.430
David Schaich (he): random variables are

663
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.559
David Schaich (he): identically distributed.

664
00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.000
David Schaich (he): which is just the statements that

665
00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.530
David Schaich (he): they have you

666
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:28.399
David Schaich (he): same

667
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.140
David Schaich (he): and secret square

668
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:36.600
David Schaich (he): in every case.

669
00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:41.810
David Schaich (he): So

670
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.629
David Schaich (he): this is exactly what we get from.

671
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.589
David Schaich (he): Yes.

672
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:48.760
David Schaich (he): repetition of an experiment that we started off

673
00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.010
David Schaich (he): today. We

674
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:51.100
David Schaich (he): so

675
00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:55.859
David Schaich (he): it's

676
00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.419
David Schaich (he): will give us exactly

677
00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:06.729
David Schaich (he): the set of so-called

678
00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:13.680
David Schaich (he): similar to

679
00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.919
David Schaich (he): the Arabic.

680
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:25.609
David Schaich (he): the so

681
00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.279
David Schaich (he): of all these random variables. Called S.

682
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:35.870
David Schaich (he): This is also

683
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.040
David Schaich (he): sorry about that

684
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.720
David Schaich (he): some as a whole.

685
00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:48.269
David Schaich (he): is a random variable.

686
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.870
The central

687
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.359
David Schaich (he): States.

688
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:53.779
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

689
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.709
David Schaich (he): We have a large number

690
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:59.109
David Schaich (he): of

691
00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.589
David Schaich (he): He's

692
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:04.510
David Schaich (he): identical and identically distributed random variables

693
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.390
David Schaich (he): probability distribution. But probably

694
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.629
David Schaich (he): yesterday.

695
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:15.000
David Schaich (he): for the song

696
00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.259
David Schaich (he): is approximately

697
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:20.470
David Schaich (he): the following.

698
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:29.419
David Schaich (he): for the

699
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:32.919
David Schaich (he): this is

700
00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.310
David Schaich (he): written down.

701
00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:38.990
Oops.

702
00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.170
David Schaich (he): So what do we have here?

703
00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:43.550
David Schaich (he): This expression for

704
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:50.309
David Schaich (he): probability, density of the sum of the large number of random variables

705
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.930
David Schaich (he): is given by.

706
00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.360
David Schaich (he): There you go

707
00:38:58.090 --> 00:38:59.399
David Schaich (he): distribution.

708
00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.139
David Schaich (he): so we can see is an exponential.

709
00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.240
The

710
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.209
David Schaich (he): random variable s

711
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:08.910
David Schaich (he): squared

712
00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:12.479
David Schaich (he): the with the this

713
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:17.219
David Schaich (he): is determined by the variance of each

714
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.669
David Schaich (he): all these random variables.

715
00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:24.950
David Schaich (he): And

716
00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.500
David Schaich (he): what over the pre-factor here is something that

717
00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.770
David Schaich (he): it's just set.

718
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:32.910
David Schaich (he): So this

719
00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.430
David Schaich (he): is a well-defined probability distribution.

720
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.239
David Schaich (he): We integrate the session function over

721
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:41.450
David Schaich (he): all possible values. Of this

722
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.349
David Schaich (he): it's a real number, then

723
00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:46.959
David Schaich (he): that is normalized to a 100% that we need.

724
00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.640
David Schaich (he): So the

725
00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.549
David Schaich (he): remarkable thing about the central limit

726
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.280
David Schaich (he): what connects it to

727
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:02.319
David Schaich (he): the

728
00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:08.580
David Schaich (he): underlying concept of version of our scale behavior that we're focusing on is that we are

729
00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:12.850
David Schaich (he): seeing the collective behavior of

730
00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.070
David Schaich (he): a large number of

731
00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.000
David Schaich (he): independence

732
00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:19.100
David Schaich (he): degrees of freedom

733
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:22.129
David Schaich (he): being described, based on the

734
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.630
David Schaich (he): properties of the you

735
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:28.160
David Schaich (he): probability for each one of those

736
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:30.169
David Schaich (he): the various

737
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:31.020
David Schaich (he): and

738
00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:33.789
David Schaich (he): mean of the probability distributions

739
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.859
David Schaich (he): for

740
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:38.149
David Schaich (he): a single one of these

741
00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:43.269
David Schaich (he): is all that we need to know in order to

742
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:46.319
David Schaich (he): predict the collective behavior.

743
00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:48.100
David Schaich (he): probably a large number of them.

744
00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.279
David Schaich (he): In practice.

745
00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.339
David Schaich (he): This

746
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:59.809
David Schaich (he): theorem turns out to be reasonably accurate, reasonably quickly.

747
00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.179
David Schaich (he): You know that

748
00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.469
David Schaich (he): hold on

749
00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:07.019
David Schaich (he): showing me

750
00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:10.760
David Schaich (he): the way it works. I,

751
00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.330
David Schaich (he): by the way, this year, too.

752
00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:20.739
David Schaich (he): get this page to fit in the screen. But what this is is looking at the probabilities of

753
00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.240
David Schaich (he): rolling a six-sided by

754
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.710
David Schaich (he): some number of times so, and

755
00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:30.510
David Schaich (he): between one to 5 and then summing up the outcome that we get

756
00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.419
David Schaich (he): a problem

757
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:37.160
David Schaich (he): that many times. So at the end of this one case this is an example we talked about

758
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:38.720
David Schaich (he): yesterday.

759
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:45.080
David Schaich (he): We have equal probability of 1 6 for getting any one of the 6 possible signs of the time

760
00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:50.160
David Schaich (he): as we roll it out more and more often and add things up.

761
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.739
David Schaich (he): you see the

762
00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.850
David Schaich (he): probabilities change

763
00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.060
David Schaich (he): the minimum.

764
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:59.669
It's always equal

765
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:00.470
David Schaich (he): to

766
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.309
David Schaich (he): the number of times

767
00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.150
David Schaich (he): that the dials roll.

768
00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:14.629
David Schaich (he): There's only one possible way of getting that. We have to go to 0 every time giving us 2, 3, 4, 5,

769
00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:17.879
David Schaich (he): 2, 3, 4, 5.

770
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:20.009
David Schaich (he): See

771
00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:21.500
David Schaich (he): program

772
00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.790
David Schaich (he): start counting.

773
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:28.630
David Schaich (he): There's also only one way to get the maximum. You have to roll the 6 every time

774
00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:29.949
David Schaich (he): you can get up to

775
00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:33.109
David Schaich (he): 12 from 2 roles, 1824.

776
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:35.669
David Schaich (he): There are

777
00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:37.040
David Schaich (he): a

778
00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:45.600
David Schaich (he): one of the possibilities to get the numbers in between. There's not just the the one way to

779
00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.649
David Schaich (he): do this.

780
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:49.250
David Schaich (he): People.

781
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.979
David Schaich (he): hey?

782
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:57.269
David Schaich (he): One, first and 2 s to the 3 or the 2 first, 1 s, so that's no one

783
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:01.990
David Schaich (he): in the case of 2 roles.

784
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:08.189
David Schaich (he): and so on to get these shapes that the following that over here is maybe the most

785
00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.569
David Schaich (he): interesting

786
00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.950
David Schaich (he): outcome.

787
00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.259
David Schaich (he): Here

788
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:14.379
David Schaich (he): the probability

789
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:17.599
David Schaich (he): distributions are being plotted with some

790
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.220
David Schaich (he): something about the axes

791
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:27.220
David Schaich (he): to

792
00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:32.399
David Schaich (he): the distribution that is showing is that continuous

793
00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.210
David Schaich (he): black crew.

794
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.490
David Schaich (he): and this, and increases

795
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.709
David Schaich (he): from one to 2,

796
00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.830
David Schaich (he): 3, 4, and 5.

797
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:44.719
David Schaich (he): You see these commonly distributions. I'm. Getting steadily closer

798
00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.090
David Schaich (he): to the simple caption.

799
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:48.609
David Schaich (he): Yes.

800
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.719
David Schaich (he): is the the

801
00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:03.799
David Schaich (he): so these are. This is a simple accounting experiment that you can do on your own. And

802
00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.450
David Schaich (he): yeah, give it the time.

803
00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:10.120
David Schaich (he): In the tutorial Thursday, you know. Somewhat more interesting example.

804
00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.240
David Schaich (he): It was right.

805
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:12.749
David Schaich (he): this sort of behavior

806
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.250
David Schaich (he): as well.

807
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.309
David Schaich (he): and maybe

808
00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.430
David Schaich (he): that is.

809
00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:27.740
David Schaich (he): And

810
00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:28.939
David Schaich (he): the

811
00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.169
David Schaich (he): how does this that

812
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:35.169
David Schaich (he): it's giving us insight into

813
00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.000
David Schaich (he): collective behavior

814
00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.019
David Schaich (he): just based on it

815
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:43.990
David Schaich (he): properties

816
00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:51.540
David Schaich (he): and what you had to.

817
00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:52.459
David Schaich (he): Oh.

818
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.500
David Schaich (he): Thursday, I

819
00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:56.590
David Schaich (he): an example

820
00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:00.210
David Schaich (he): showing how the Central

821
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.240
David Schaich (he): and that that challenge you

822
00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:04.349
experiment.

823
00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:06.310
David Schaich (he): that's all.

824
00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:09.400
David Schaich (he): You can also

825
00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:12.470
David Schaich (he): use that as a way to introduce some of the

826
00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.090
David Schaich (he): our programming.

827
00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:18.599
David Schaich (he): We dive into 4. We go next Tuesday and the the first computer.

828
00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:21.410
David Schaich (he): The computer project should also

829
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:22.969
David Schaich (he): checked and ready to

830
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.410
David Schaich (he): share with you my

831
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:27.700
David Schaich (he): Thursday morning.

832
00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:29.540
David Schaich (he): And then

833
00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:32.909
David Schaich (he): next time one day working, we will look at the

834
00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.550
David Schaich (he): random walks that would be next big topic

835
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:38.040
David Schaich (he): They are

836
00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:39.920
David Schaich (he): i'm going to.

837
00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:41.330
David Schaich (he): I like some of this

838
00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:42.839
David Schaich (he): all one abstract

839
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:46.970
David Schaich (he): discussions of the all of our numbers, etc., when it comes together into

840
00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.250
David Schaich (he): hey

841
00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:51.990
David Schaich (he): application that is actually fairly general and powerful.

842
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:57.009
David Schaich (he): The behavior of an object that can take random steps

843
00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:59.070
David Schaich (he): in some directions

844
00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:00.649
David Schaich (he): which

845
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:05.380
David Schaich (he): it could be just in the example of graveling. Not that yesterday

846
00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:10.879
David Schaich (he): we talked about pollen grains that were being randomly kicked by the water, and all the people that were sitting in.

847
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:13.979
David Schaich (he): They move around randomly.

848
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:16.630
David Schaich (he): but random walks can also be

849
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:17.939
to model

850
00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:22.309
David Schaich (he): genetic drift as populations.

851
00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:25.939
David Schaich (he): as well as just random fluctuations in

852
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:27.360
David Schaich (he): to the stock prices.

853
00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:31.700
David Schaich (he): I random walking in running space. Some of you may or see

854
00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.989
David Schaich (he): some of the financial mass

855
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:35.850
David Schaich (he): modules.

856
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:41.550
David Schaich (he): So that's the plan for tutorial and starting next week

857
00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.770
David Schaich (he): questions about what we've seen

858
00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:45.649
David Schaich (he): today. You call me

859
00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.299
David Schaich (he): holiday.

860
00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:54.140
David Schaich (he): Not seeing any. I'll let you go.

861
00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:54.919
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

862
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:57.390
David Schaich (he): forward to see you again Thursday morning.

863
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.250
David Schaich (he): Okay, by the next time we're in this room.

864
00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:03.969
David Schaich (he): be able to

865
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.600
David Schaich (he): get the

866
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:10.690
David Schaich (he): projector to share on the screen here. Not sure how

867
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:12.470
David Schaich (he): visible

868
00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:14.580
David Schaich (he): all of that words.
