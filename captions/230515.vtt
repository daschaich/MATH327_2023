1
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.870
David Schaich (he): Okay, let's

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.590
David Schaich (he): get under way with this final rescheduled

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:17.770
David Schaich (he): lecture, making up for some of the excessive bank holidays this month.  So we are in week 13, but I think

4
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.730
David Schaich (he): no final exams in the Maths Department are scheduled until next week. So you should have plenty of time

5
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:36.050
David Schaich (he): to review for those and get the last fun bits of more modern aspects of statistical physics this morning.  But, getting under way,

6
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.640
David Schaich (he): the 6-digit code for today,

7
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.670
David Schaich (he): the last one there will be, is 6, 0, 4, 2, 1, 3.

8
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.240
David Schaich (he): And

9
00:00:49.900 --> 00:01:01.260
David Schaich (he): before getting going with the last bit about interacting systems, just checking to see if there are questions about what we did last week or any previous week in the term,

10
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.120
David Schaich (he): or about the

11
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.210
David Schaich (he): homework feedback and solutions that should have reached you

12
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.010
David Schaich (he): over the weekend.  The feedback, at least, the solutions went up around the middle of last week.

13
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.390
David Schaich (he): and well, you consider that and quickly bring up those solutions to talk about a couple of general

14
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:37.300
David Schaich (he): places in general. It was very good performance. Most folks, Scott. most everything correct.

15
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.880
David Schaich (he): The sort of 2 most common

16
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.220
David Schaich (he): places where

17
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:56.730
David Schaich (he): people tripped up were in questions one and 3 in particular. The high temperature, expansion, Part of the first question there are these to a kind of nasty series.

18
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.540
David Schaich (he): functions of one minus

19
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:06.230
David Schaich (he): E to the minus x, either the numerator or the argument to the logarithm. It is perfectly acceptable actually to look up

20
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.050
David Schaich (he): both of these series, which you can find in places like like a P. Video

21
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.760
David Schaich (he): or theendiums of

22
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.980
David Schaich (he): See serious expansion data you don't have to derive from from scratch.

23
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.520
David Schaich (he): It's just so long as you give that citation to let me know where

24
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.100
David Schaich (he): you got the series from. But the

25
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.780
David Schaich (he): question, the issue that a few people ran into here

26
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.360
David Schaich (he): and

27
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.550
David Schaich (he): zoom is saying that there was trouble with the

28
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.710
David Schaich (he): video which hopefully is back on. That's why I was distracted there.

29
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.980
David Schaich (he): It was fairly common for folks to

30
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.020
David Schaich (he): only keep the linear term in the denominator here

31
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:06.300
David Schaich (he): cancel that out against the numerator, and just get a constant value in the overall expression.

32
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.580
David Schaich (he): which turns out to be incorrect, because, as you can see.

33
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:19.900
David Schaich (he): there are one over X Times linear and X terms that give additional contributions to that linear piece. So it is not

34
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.480
David Schaich (he): a consistent expansion and powers of the small parameter.

35
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.200
David Schaich (he): just to truncate the denominator

36
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.810
David Schaich (he): at that time first term X.

37
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.530
David Schaich (he): And

38
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.150
David Schaich (he): so that led to a answer that was

39
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.490
David Schaich (he): wrong to the extent that it actually disagreed quite strikingly with

40
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.440
David Schaich (he): the asymptotic limits that we went through in the lectures back before the spring breaks. That was a

41
00:03:51.490 --> 00:04:03.490
David Schaich (he): 78 that would have that something was going on in terms of missing those additional terms, additional contributions that cancel out

42
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.820
David Schaich (he): that linear piece and leave only something

43
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.600
David Schaich (he): that goes like Beta h squared or the internal energy, and Beta squared H squared for the entropy

44
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.440
David Schaich (he): that logarithmic term that most people didn't get.

45
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.880
David Schaich (he): and then the issue in question 3.

46
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.220
David Schaich (he): Or maybe it's better to look at The problem set up itself.

47
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:43.300
David Schaich (he): Wanted to compute the efficiency of the Diesel cycle and compare it to that of the auto cycle that

48
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.220
David Schaich (he): models petrol engines.

49
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.340
David Schaich (he): the you know.

50
00:04:49.190 --> 00:05:03.350
David Schaich (he): most common place for people to get tripped up here was actually not keeping track. Of which of these 4 processes contributed to the work or the key flow that determines the efficiency.

51
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.820
David Schaich (he): and the specific issue was

52
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:20.570
David Schaich (he): neglecting any work done in the second stage. The injection and ignition stage and Diesel cycle going from 2 to 3, and just arguing that the entire change in the internal energy

53
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:32.500
David Schaich (he): E times the difference of these 2 volumes corresponding to the inputs being pumped into the system by inviting that Diesel fuel.

54
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.780
David Schaich (he): Or is also there is work being done just given by the integral. okay

55
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.790
David Schaich (he): constant line from the 2 to 3.

56
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.050
David Schaich (he): So we have.

57
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.730
David Schaich (he): Or when that mistake was made by a few people, the

58
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.110
David Schaich (he): functional form in terms of factors of

59
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.550
David Schaich (he): See the compression ratio.

60
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:04.010
David Schaich (he): and or sorry I see the cut off ratio, and r is the compression ratio that See to the five-thirds minus one over

61
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.140
David Schaich (he): are the two-thirds times, c. Minus one

62
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:14.520
David Schaich (he): still comes out. Correct. The ultimate results of neglecting the work in the

63
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:21.560
David Schaich (he): ignition stage is at this three-fifths it gets increased to

64
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.590
David Schaich (he): one.

65
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.060
David Schaich (he): So you have something that looks more like the auto cycle. it's just that

66
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.460
David Schaich (he): factor of c. That ratio of C is multiplying the one over

67
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.160
David Schaich (he): part of the two-thirds.

68
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:46.960
David Schaich (he): and there the standard check that you could do is to consider certain values of c. And see that the efficiency in that case is actually going negative. which is problematic.

69
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:59.250
David Schaich (he): And I will say, while i'm here, that this whole page of argumentation and plotting things is a lot more work than needs to be done to establish that

70
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:08.350
David Schaich (he): the Diesel cycle is less efficient than the auto cycle for a fixed compression ratio. Basically all that needs to happen is showing that

71
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.400
David Schaich (he): this three-fifths, times the ratio of

72
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:22.940
David Schaich (he): C to the five-thirds, minus one over, c. Minus one is always greater than or equal to one which

73
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:37.340
David Schaich (he): you can do by. Look at how's rule as C approaches one. Then just the inspection that's for see, larger than one. that larger power of sea is growing faster at the lower power of see.

74
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:48.310
David Schaich (he): So any questions that have come up well going over that

75
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.100
David Schaich (he): underwise

76
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:58.380
David Schaich (he): Look at the plan for today. which is

77
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:05.000
David Schaich (he): first wrapping up the mean feel approximation for

78
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:10.820
David Schaich (he): using my whole. We introduced last week

79
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:21.920
David Schaich (he): easy model. Here is our simplest interacting statistical system that we can consider.

80
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.320
David Schaich (he): and then that should not take even the

81
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.230
David Schaich (he): first half of today's lecture. So we have plenty of time for

82
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:41.309
David Schaich (he): a quick look at numerical methods with 4, the using model. But

83
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.510
David Schaich (he): things that can be

84
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.490
David Schaich (he): applied more probably to

85
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:56.740
David Schaich (he): a wider variety of interacting and statistical systems that are very difficult to analyze

86
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.910
David Schaich (he): analytically, as we have seen, just for the easy model.

87
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.100
David Schaich (he): and

88
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.420
David Schaich (he): depending on how quickly all that goes. You might touch on

89
00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:18.280
David Schaich (he): sort of modern research, using miracle methods in the form of Labs field theory to investigate

90
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.100
David Schaich (he): strongly interacting

91
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.620
David Schaich (he): many variable systems. I will say that

92
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:34.220
David Schaich (he): in addition to the last tutorial activity. On Thursday we did at least a bit of

93
00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:39.520
David Schaich (he): module recap and review for the exam preparation back, then, so I don't

94
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.320
David Schaich (he): expect to revisit that today, unless there are

95
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.120
David Schaich (he): specific questions about

96
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.230
David Schaich (he): any of the topics that are coming up.

97
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.320
David Schaich (he): So with that

98
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.910
David Schaich (he): plan in place, we can recall that

99
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.370
David Schaich (he): in the field

100
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.410
David Schaich (he): approximation

101
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.960
David Schaich (he): takes the energy of the using model

102
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:13.670
David Schaich (he): from the interacting form. the product of 2 spins on your receivering sites defined by the at the structure.

103
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.880
David Schaich (he): the contribution to the energy from the external magnetic field. and we approximate that

104
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.600
David Schaich (he): my just a constant term

105
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:31.120
David Schaich (he): that involves the square of the expectation value of the organization so

106
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:36.080
David Schaich (he): equality that comes from summing over all possible configurations

107
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.910
David Schaich (he): of the spins is there for independent out the spin configuration.

108
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.150
David Schaich (he): And then there is

109
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.340
David Schaich (he): another factor of that

110
00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.130
David Schaich (he): me mechanization

111
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.750
David Schaich (he): that multiplies the actual

112
00:10:53.650 --> 00:11:02.870
David Schaich (he): sum over the spin values that is dependent on the configuration. Along with that external magnetic field we are, we defined

113
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.670
David Schaich (he): this term of the parentheses to be an effective magnetic field.

114
00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:19.360
David Schaich (he): and the approximation here was by neglecting fluctuations around that magnetization around that means

115
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.990
David Schaich (he): I assuming that on average.

116
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.280
David Schaich (he): those fluctuations were small.

117
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.150
David Schaich (he): and the the square

118
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.730
David Schaich (he): of them is negligible

119
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.550
David Schaich (he): compared to terms that depend more directly on

120
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:44.090
David Schaich (he): the mean spin itself. So we ended up with in the interacting system

121
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.470
David Schaich (he): that's still retains

122
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:55.480
David Schaich (he): some memory of the interaction through the form of this

123
00:11:55.810 --> 00:12:03.620
David Schaich (he): effective magnetic field. That depends on it. The mean value of the spin.

124
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.890
David Schaich (he): and in particular we can see that it involves

125
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.640
David Schaich (he): the product of that means spin.

126
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.190
David Schaich (he): and the

127
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.170
David Schaich (he): to the

128
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:33.400
David Schaich (he): nearest neighbors of each spin s of N in a dimensional cubic lattice. and this is something that is going to

129
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:40.400
David Schaich (he): up again in just a few minutes, as we check to see how well this approximation actually functions

130
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:49.200
David Schaich (he): and various settings first less. Again: consider continuing with the recap last week where we left off

131
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.640
David Schaich (he): was analyzing the

132
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.350
David Schaich (he): self-consistency condition

133
00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.300
David Schaich (he): for the maximization

134
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.510
David Schaich (he): in this

135
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.730
David Schaich (he): being fuel approximation, which was that the organization itself.

136
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:14.930
David Schaich (he): it's equal to hyperbolic engines where the maximization also appears.

137
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:29.110
David Schaich (he): So we have it incidental equation that we want to solve, to find self consistent values for that expectation going of the organization.

138
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:35.360
David Schaich (he): And we saw in particular. and it was always possible for 0 to be the solution.

139
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.010
David Schaich (he): at least in the case of a vanishing external magnetic field.

140
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.090
David Schaich (he): 0 equals 0.

141
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.040
David Schaich (he): But at low temperatures

142
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:50.960
David Schaich (he): there were

143
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.110
David Schaich (he): additional solutions that

144
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.270
David Schaich (he): emerged. So, in addition to

145
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.320
David Schaich (he): M. Equals 0,

146
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.510
David Schaich (he): we saw and this

147
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.350
David Schaich (he): self-consistency condition is also satisfied

148
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.600
David Schaich (he): M. Equal to

149
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.850
David Schaich (he): positive and negatively

150
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.670
David Schaich (he): not equal to 0 in particular, approach

151
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.750
David Schaich (he): the maximum value of plus or minus one.

152
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.230
David Schaich (he): as that temperature goes down to absolute 0. This is the

153
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.680
David Schaich (he): illustration of this that we were looking at in some detail.

154
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.260
David Schaich (he): The

155
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.730
David Schaich (he): blue curve is low temperature one where the

156
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.720
David Schaich (he): solution you always have a 0. It's supplemented

157
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.560
David Schaich (he): by it. These 2 additional

158
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.210
David Schaich (he): solutions where the patches intersect

159
00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.980
David Schaich (he): my organization itself

160
00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.850
David Schaich (he): at plus and minus and not.

161
00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:01.590
David Schaich (he): And we wrapped up last week with the argument that

162
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.630
David Schaich (he): in that

163
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.720
David Schaich (he): low temperature case. Yeah.

164
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:11.950
David Schaich (he): Solution at 0 magnetization turns out to be unstable

165
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.310
David Schaich (he): in the sense that any infinitesimal fluctuation around it.

166
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.540
David Schaich (he): We need the system to

167
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:28.320
David Schaich (he): continue moving to larger and larger values in the organization, either positive or negative, until it ends up at one of the other 2 solutions.

168
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.580
David Schaich (he): So that

169
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:39.440
David Schaich (he): yeah, low temperatures. the solution of any computer is unstable. And just to

170
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:49.680
David Schaich (he): we establish this point and look at it in a slightly different way of analyzing things.

171
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:56.660
David Schaich (he): We can sort of reinforce this inclusion, and maybe make it a bit more intuitive.

172
00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.600
David Schaich (he): My, carry me out what's called a

173
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.750
David Schaich (he): stability analysis.

174
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.860
David Schaich (he): So instead of

175
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:25.910
David Schaich (he): both the organization and the tang the 2 sides of that self-consistency conditioner. both on the same set of axes for you look at is

176
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.660
David Schaich (he): the difference between them.

177
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.780
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

178
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.560
David Schaich (he): minus the magnetization

179
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.330
David Schaich (he): and look for

180
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:44.250
David Schaich (he): the roots are the zeros

181
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.620
David Schaich (he): of this difference.

182
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:54.070
David Schaich (he): and already we can see that if we are ever away from any of those routes.

183
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.420
David Schaich (he): If this difference is

184
00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.560
David Schaich (he): greater than 0 or positive. that means that the

185
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:07.750
David Schaich (he): mechanization is too small to fully cancel out the tch.

186
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.710
David Schaich (he): So. in order to find it, we should try

187
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.099
David Schaich (he): increasing the

188
00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:17.010
David Schaich (he): maximization

189
00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:22.849
David Schaich (he): and same story if it's negative the

190
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:27.690
David Schaich (he): large and they can assign, and it is overwhelming the tang.

191
00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:29.000
David Schaich (he): and therefore

192
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.350
David Schaich (he): the route should be found at smaller values

193
00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:38.290
David Schaich (he): of admin. So that is

194
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.210
David Schaich (he): what is shown here right.

195
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.740
David Schaich (he): Can't quite fit it

196
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.640
David Schaich (he): onto the projector.

197
00:17:48.210 --> 00:18:00.280
David Schaich (he): So these are the same 3 temperatures as in the Pl. We looked at last time that should be up on the screen now focused.

198
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.080
David Schaich (he): This is the organization as usual.

199
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:09.880
David Schaich (he): and the Y-axis is that difference between the I of the tangents and the organization?

200
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.820
David Schaich (he): We see the one route.

201
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.480
all 3 temperatures, 2 4 and 8,

202
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.280
David Schaich (he): and the 2 additional routes, and plus and minus

203
00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.830
David Schaich (he): I'm. Not

204
00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:32.640
David Schaich (he): with the low temperature. It is 2 in the blue. and whenever any of these lines are greater than 0. So the difference between. and

205
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.080
David Schaich (he): it is positive

206
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:40.700
David Schaich (he): that is the conclusion that the organization is too small and the

207
00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.270
David Schaich (he): hello

208
00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:51.280
David Schaich (he): to find the route. It's always going to go to a larger value to the so. This 4 arrows are all pointing to the right, to larger M.

209
00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:57.080
David Schaich (he): And and you in exactly the symmetric way.

210
00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:03.370
David Schaich (he): and if any of these 3 curves are negative, the arrows are always pointing to the left to smaller values

211
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:10.280
David Schaich (he): of the organization. and just looking at these arrows, it is easier to have a

212
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.360
David Schaich (he): intuitive or concrete sense of

213
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.170
David Schaich (he): what makes these roots stable or not.

214
00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.820
David Schaich (he): at high temperatures when the only room is 0. You see that

215
00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.000
David Schaich (he): both of those flows are

216
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.770
David Schaich (he): pointing towards that route. So if there's any, if there's a flexible flex away from it.

217
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.870
David Schaich (he): it will be

218
00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.870
David Schaich (he): this

219
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.440
David Schaich (he): this flow to find that the roots of the difference.

220
00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:41.450
David Schaich (he): but

221
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.250
David Schaich (he): the direction of the arrows.

222
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:57.290
David Schaich (he): the root at 0 flips for the low temperature, you also pointing away from it. It is the other solutions that's not 0 organization

223
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.200
David Schaich (he): that they actually

224
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:10.740
David Schaich (he): point 2, and that then are stable under small fluctuations. So this is the the same argument and the same conclusion we went through at the very end of last week's lecture. Just

225
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:21.680
David Schaich (he): go on any different way that. Thank you. So additional certainty and confidence in our understanding of what is going on.

226
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.030
David Schaich (he): So any questions about this? Before we

227
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.110
David Schaich (he): stop laboring this point, it starts

228
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.140
David Schaich (he): applying it to what it

229
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.310
David Schaich (he): it more concrete predictions for

230
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:36.390
David Schaich (he): that we feel approximation.

231
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.580
David Schaich (he): not only that's

232
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:51.790
David Schaich (he): to be satisfied with our conclusion that that we have

233
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.420
David Schaich (he): hey? Yeah.

234
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.380
David Schaich (he): non-zero magnetization at

235
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.860
David Schaich (he): low temperatures

236
00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:06.030
David Schaich (he): and a 0 magnetization at high temperatures

237
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.870
David Schaich (he): over now it will zoom back in

238
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:17.430
David Schaich (he): it focuses.

239
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.240
David Schaich (he): So the disordered solution with vanishing mechanizations, unstable

240
00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:35.990
David Schaich (he): or low temperatures, and at least at the qualitative level of the existence of

241
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:42.240
David Schaich (he): 2 phases with 2 different behaviors. For this order parameter of the organization.

242
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:44.340
David Schaich (he): You have

243
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.460
David Schaich (he): the behavior that we would want from any approximation to

244
00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.220
David Schaich (he): the using model.

245
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:59.910
David Schaich (he): You see, there is an ordered phase at low temperatures. a disorder phase at high temperatures

246
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.510
David Schaich (he): like to you. Well

247
00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:15.890
David Schaich (he): interacting, using the model that we starting off with and have approximated. It's a not interacting system with a remnant of the interaction wrapped up in its effective

248
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.210
David Schaich (he): magnetic field.

249
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:23.690
David Schaich (he): So we have the those 2 different behaviors, and we want to

250
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.980
David Schaich (he): determine what happens to get from one to the other.

251
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.090
David Schaich (he): Remember, we had the 2 possibilities

252
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.320
David Schaich (he): versus that. There is a smooth, gradual change

253
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:50.160
David Schaich (he): which is the case for non interacting spin systems. You saw it in the homework that Yeah. I am the temperature limits for that non interacting theory also have

254
00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.270
David Schaich (he): 0 or non-zero.

255
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:58.730
David Schaich (he): But there is not a true phase transition between them just a gradual boring

256
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:11.230
David Schaich (he): and slow change, with nothing special going on. The opposite behavior is that there is a particular value of the control parameters for the using model.

257
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.540
David Schaich (he): Yeah. 0 field

258
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.480
David Schaich (he): that we're still sticking with

259
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:18.980
David Schaich (he): here from the previous page

260
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:31.930
David Schaich (he): a reminder there any particular value of the temperature, the only remaining control parameter. There is some discontinuity either in the magnetization

261
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.110
David Schaich (he): for and one of its derivatives with respect to the temperature.

262
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:47.880
David Schaich (he): the location of that disc critical temperature of the phase, transition and the existence of the disc a true phase, Transition.

263
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.330
David Schaich (he): Where are they going?

264
00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:53.640
David Schaich (he): You see smooth crossover

265
00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.720
David Schaich (he): one regime to the other.

266
00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:01.680
David Schaich (he): I guess To you first question we can answer is.

267
00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.170
David Schaich (he): When

268
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:11.480
David Schaich (he): do the 2 additional solutions up here for low temperature? So how low does the temperature have to be

269
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.920
David Schaich (he): in order for these tanches to different.

270
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.150
David Schaich (he): although we're about to be

271
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:35.640
David Schaich (he): difference here to Oh. upon the below the x-axis. and for 8 hero additional roots in non-zero mechanisms

272
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.480
David Schaich (he): to appear. and for

273
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.350
David Schaich (he): the disordered solution

274
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.400
David Schaich (he): to become unstable.

275
00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.580
David Schaich (he): So if

276
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.940
David Schaich (he): if there is a true phase, transition.

277
00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.440
David Schaich (he): then the temperature at which this happens

278
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.350
David Schaich (he): will be the critical temperature

279
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:19.820
David Schaich (he): at Tc. They'll still have to answer the question of whether there is a phase, transition or not. That's a bit easier to starts my computing the temperature itself, at which

280
00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.770
David Schaich (he): these additional

281
00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:27.920
David Schaich (he): solutions to the self-consistency condition appear. and

282
00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:34.480
David Schaich (he): is from our arguments last time and inspection of this plot. we can see that

283
00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:45.290
David Schaich (he): ultimately the tangent will approach plus or minus one, at the limits of very larger small organization.

284
00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.900
David Schaich (he): So in order, for there to be an intersection over there.

285
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:55.210
David Schaich (he): The slope of that tensions at the 0 organization

286
00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:59.980
David Schaich (he): used to be greater than the slope of the magnetization itself, which is one.

287
00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.650
David Schaich (he): and that will give us the

288
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:09.140
David Schaich (he): creation.

289
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.660
David Schaich (he): I don't see you hence, being greater than

290
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.100
David Schaich (he): magnetization for an infinitesimal.

291
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:24.610
David Schaich (he): How's it? How you, with the organization same for the negative side, just to your image.

292
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.910
David Schaich (he): And this happens whenever the

293
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.490
David Schaich (he): slope of that evolved engine is created in one

294
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.070
David Schaich (he): at 0 organization.

295
00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.320
David Schaich (he): So we just need to compute

296
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.840
David Schaich (he): the sloop of the Tch with respect to

297
00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.320
David Schaich (he): organization.

298
00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:58.280
David Schaich (he): and evaluate that at 0 organization. Which is.

299
00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:04.130
David Schaich (he): it's pretty trivial to do if we just expand that in with the same in the power series that

300
00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:10.560
David Schaich (he): it pop up in the homework hopefully, something familiar. But now it wasn't before

301
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:15.240
David Schaich (he): a linear term in the

302
00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:23.990
David Schaich (he): honest organization. and then minus the third is the argument cube which we don't actually have to

303
00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:35.050
David Schaich (he): worry about, because that cubic term and all of the higher powers accounted for by that bigger notation. We all still have

304
00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:44.440
David Schaich (he): factors of the mechanization remaining after taking the derivative which one we set the manization 0, we'll answer them all out.

305
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:53.500
David Schaich (he): We actually have the exact relation that the slope is just to be the Times deed, and we want that

306
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:58.100
David Schaich (he): to be greater than one. So Tc. Will be right at the point where

307
00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:04.810
David Schaich (he): the slope is equal to one. and I mean larger temperatures. We will have

308
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:10.350
David Schaich (he): an instability at 0 manifestation and non-zero solutions

309
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.260
David Schaich (he): we're responding to the ported phase, and the smaller values. We will have

310
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:21.580
David Schaich (he): only the 0 solution for the disorder phase. So the critical temperature. which is

311
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.090
David Schaich (he): the inverse of that critical beta

312
00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:38.760
David Schaich (he): satisfies this equation. So one over Beta is twice the dimensionality of the system. So it's saved very quick and easy prediction from the mean field approximation.

313
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:48.610
David Schaich (he): 4 would be a critical temperature. If we do have transition. So that's answer that question what we're at? It?

314
00:28:54.020 --> 00:29:02.650
David Schaich (he): Is there actually a phase transition at this point where the disordered solution becomes unstable.

315
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:20.990
David Schaich (he): which is to show up in the form of you just continuity. either in the older parameter or one of its derivatives. So what we have to do to answer this question is.

316
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.710
David Schaich (he): Look at that order parameter in a bit more detail. We have

317
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.280
David Schaich (he): a self-consistency condition for it.

318
00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:34.990
David Schaich (he): The parameters magazine is equal to the hands of itself with

319
00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:41.470
David Schaich (he): that H. Me that it's set to 0,

320
00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.210
David Schaich (he): and consider

321
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:51.430
David Schaich (he): what happens for temperatures that are close to but slightly smaller. Then

322
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.020
David Schaich (he): the Tc. We have just computed.

323
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.890
David Schaich (he): so

324
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.600
David Schaich (he): recall that larger temperatures.

325
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:11.690
David Schaich (he): We don't want it so only the disorder solution. Of Lower temperatures will have a non-zero value for the mechanization so work in terms of the

326
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:13.380
David Schaich (he): absolute value

327
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:20.890
David Schaich (he): which is going to be greater than 0, but because we consider temperatures that are close to the transition.

328
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.450
David Schaich (he): the

329
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:32.280
David Schaich (he): additional pair of roots will be very close by to 0. It will just be a slight problem

330
00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:37.100
David Schaich (he): above 0 and back, then one your image on the other side.

331
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:43.580
David Schaich (he): It is absolute value of the mechanization, but still be much less than one.

332
00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:46.150
David Schaich (he): and we can again expand.

333
00:30:47.210 --> 00:31:00.160
David Schaich (he): The argument of this Tch to Beta D. We found, is approximately one around Tc. And is much less than one to the argument of the tan. She is on hold much less than one.

334
00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:05.870
David Schaich (he): So we have there for that.

335
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.340
David Schaich (he): The organization

336
00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:24.430
David Schaich (he): is going to be first step in your term, she beta the him sitting she made an E to one. It gives us a trivial relation. M equals M.

337
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:28.160
David Schaich (he): Let's bring in something non-trivial with the next power.

338
00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:34.960
David Schaich (he): the change extension 2 beta d and to and then

339
00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:43.950
David Schaich (he): you can set aside all of the terms of the higher power in this small parameter

340
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.910
David Schaich (he): you made a do, You

341
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:51.780
David Schaich (he): is going to be close to one, but not exactly one. When t is

342
00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.920
David Schaich (he): less than the Tc. The

343
00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:04.550
David Schaich (he): 2D. Is Tc. The beta is one over T. So we can write those factors as that ratio of critical temperature

344
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:16.750
David Schaich (he): over the temperature of the system. and if we move this cubic term to the other side. cancel out the common power of organization. Have you

345
00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.150
David Schaich (he): plus one food you see over t June

346
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:26.330
David Schaich (he): Organization Square is equal to.

347
00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:35.720
David Schaich (he): and then your term with the M cancelled out is just Tc. Over T, the end canceled out to you to the other side is a minus one.

348
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:39.300
David Schaich (he): So M squared

349
00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.530
David Schaich (he): itself.

350
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:49.890
David Schaich (he): It's easy to right down at this point. Just take yeah, so one third

351
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:55.140
David Schaich (he): PC. Over T to the other side.

352
00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.680
David Schaich (he): and then Tc. And with T minus one. If we borrow one factor of

353
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:04.600
David Schaich (he): you can cancel out that first ratio.

354
00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:07.670
David Schaich (he): and great thing is in terms of

355
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:14.800
David Schaich (he): one minus T over Tc. Which is useful, because now we have

356
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:22.160
David Schaich (he): always the same ratio with Tc. In the denominator showing up in both places with just 2 factors

357
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:23.430
David Schaich (he): left there.

358
00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:28.780
David Schaich (he): and, in fact, we can now make use of

359
00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:37.380
David Schaich (he): our condition that she is close to Tc. We square something

360
00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:39.510
David Schaich (he): that is

361
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:47.150
David Schaich (he): fairly close to one. We will still have something that is fairly close to one. and

362
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:50.970
David Schaich (he): the ultimate value of the accusation given by

363
00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.580
David Schaich (he): plus or minus

364
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:56.180
David Schaich (he): symmetrically, as we should expect.

365
00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.130
David Schaich (he): And the analysis we've been doing.

366
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:04.480
David Schaich (he): and it was a square root of 3 out front

367
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.030
David Schaich (he): and then another square roots of

368
00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:17.780
David Schaich (he): this factor, one minus T over Tc. We can also write just as well as Tc. Minus T over to, you see.

369
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:25.340
David Schaich (he): which makes it easier to see that the argument of the square root is strictly positive. So we have a nice real

370
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:29.760
David Schaich (he): solution for the mechanization. It depends

371
00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:39.230
David Schaich (he): on the square roots of the temperature relative to this critical or potentially critical value. If this

372
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:41.040
David Schaich (he): is a phase transition.

373
00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:46.219
David Schaich (he): but we can already see from this expression that

374
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.550
David Schaich (he): any phase, transition will not be a first order one.

375
00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:53.580
David Schaich (he): This mechanization is continuous.

376
00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.130
David Schaich (he): When T equals Tc.

377
00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.760
David Schaich (he): It's just right that down

378
00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:16.260
David Schaich (he): to be definite. We have the organization being proportional to

379
00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:20.610
David Schaich (he): the square root of Tc. Minus. T:

380
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:34.200
David Schaich (he): when yeah is less than, but still close to Tc. And at higher temperatures when it's in the disorder phase, it goes to 0

381
00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:44.490
David Schaich (he): of making it approximations. So what we have is

382
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.690
David Schaich (he): a 12. The manization versus temperature

383
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:56.340
David Schaich (he): that looks kind of like this around Tc. Comes down like a square root. I should put this into different colors, so it's

384
00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:01.200
David Schaich (he): the function, and then 0 from their own out

385
00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:09.450
David Schaich (he): and at Tc. The square root and 0 converge at 0. But we can see that there is a

386
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.430
David Schaich (he): in in this continuous

387
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.520
David Schaich (he): option

388
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.450
David Schaich (he): which shows up as

389
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:19.210
David Schaich (he): a discontinuity

390
00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:22.370
David Schaich (he): in or actually it, versions in the

391
00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:34.530
David Schaich (he): first derivative of the maximization. With respect to that, maybe they feel the square root of sorry, the derivative of a square root. I'll bring that square root down to

392
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:35.600
David Schaich (he): the

393
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:39.120
David Schaich (he): denominator

394
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:46.530
David Schaich (he): again for it temperatures that are let's stand up close to Tc.

395
00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:53.250
David Schaich (he): So this now it diverges as T approaches Tc.

396
00:36:55.100 --> 00:37:01.540
David Schaich (he): From below. So we do have a discontinuity. and the

397
00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:11.260
David Schaich (he): first derivative of the order parameter rather than the order of Parameter itself, which, looking back to our taxonomy, is what we described as

398
00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.170
David Schaich (he): a second order

399
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.130
David Schaich (he): phase transition.

400
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.430
David Schaich (he): We're calling that

401
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:26.490
David Schaich (he): the mechanization is a derivative of the free energy. So it's derivative is the second derivative

402
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.670
David Schaich (he): of that. And what's free energy.

403
00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:33.230
David Schaich (he): And this is

404
00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.510
David Schaich (he): we got the prediction.

405
00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.940
David Schaich (he): Second order face from that She was predicted by the mean field approximation.

406
00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.360
David Schaich (he): And

407
00:37:55.510 --> 00:38:03.590
David Schaich (he): looking at the time, I will add just a brief note that in general this sort of second order phase, transition

408
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:08.870
David Schaich (he): is the result.

409
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:14.300
David Schaich (he): Whenever the order parameter. In this case the

410
00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:22.070
David Schaich (he): mechanization is proportional to Tc. Minus T to some power that i'll call B.

411
00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:34.800
David Schaich (he): Where is this? B has to be a not integer, so that the subsequent derivatives eventually bring it down into the denominator rather than just

412
00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.830
David Schaich (he): sending it to a constant.

413
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:40.030
David Schaich (he): as they would, if it were a polynomial.

414
00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:42.890
David Schaich (he): and

415
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:56.270
David Schaich (he): this would be, is known as the critical exponents of the phase transition. In this case the is it half predicted by. We need fuel approximation.

416
00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.010
David Schaich (he): So that is

417
00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:03.330
David Schaich (he): something we can say more generally and just the using model

418
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.700
David Schaich (he): over the mean people, approximation to it.

419
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.350
David Schaich (he): And

420
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.590
David Schaich (he): this is a useful thing to

421
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:19.170
David Schaich (he): talk about. try to rise in the previous transitions in terms of the set of critical exponents, that they have

422
00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:24.250
David Schaich (he): not only for the order. But for various other

423
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.570
David Schaich (he): observables

424
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:29.940
David Schaich (he): we can define other critical exponents coming from how

425
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:34.520
David Schaich (he): those observable quantities behave in the vicinity of the transition at something.

426
00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.600
David Schaich (he): You don't have time to go into here.

427
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:44.500
David Schaich (he): But it's worth being aware that

428
00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:49.540
David Schaich (he): many phase transitions or different systems

429
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:54.600
David Schaich (he): actually have the same set

430
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:58.520
David Schaich (he): of critical exponents.

431
00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:04.260
David Schaich (he): even for systems that

432
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:09.480
David Schaich (he): don't resemble each other in any obvious way.

433
00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:15.940
David Schaich (he): So one example that is discussed in the lecture notes, and that we don't have time to

434
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:25.540
David Schaich (he): to go through it in detail. It's i'm not going to be on the exam, or anything like that. Just a piece of interest is looking at with with gas phase transitions so

435
00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:30.380
David Schaich (he): boiling water and a kettle, as well as more general transitions between

436
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:39.340
David Schaich (he): any States and any gashes. They are the same substance That is a second order, previous transition with a certain set of critical exponents

437
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:50.340
David Schaich (he): that turned out to be exactly the same set of critical exponents as the easing model of interacting nearest neighbor pairs of spins on a 3 dimensional

438
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.840
David Schaich (he): cubic class, simple cubic lattice.

439
00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:58.870
David Schaich (he): And there's no connection between a 3D using model

440
00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:02.300
David Schaich (he): and oil like liquids and gases

441
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:04.940
David Schaich (he): that just happens to be

442
00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:10.870
David Schaich (he): that their long business behavior around this, their critical

443
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:14.840
David Schaich (he): points around the for your transitions

444
00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:20.900
David Schaich (he): is exactly the same, despite the different underlying physics that leads to those

445
00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.480
David Schaich (he): these transitions.

446
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:30.260
David Schaich (he): So this behavior it was under the name of universality.

447
00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.350
David Schaich (he): And what it amounts to is

448
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:45.410
David Schaich (he): that the large-scale behavior of macroscopic systems that emerges your critical points

449
00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.350
David Schaich (he): is

450
00:41:54.970 --> 00:42:03.350
David Schaich (he): largely independence of the details of the microstates and the microscopic squeeze freedom and interactions that

451
00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:17.300
David Schaich (he): lead to those phase transitions. In the first place. so computing the critical exponents of phase transitions can be a very powerful way of analyzing those systems, because they can then be related.

452
00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:18.220
David Schaich (he): you know.

453
00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:23.910
David Schaich (he): obviously not intuitive way is to simpler systems like or than liquids to

454
00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:31.480
David Schaich (he): the easing model on a three-dimensional cubic lattice. and this universality was only.

455
00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:41.320
David Schaich (he): it was observed in the early twentieth century, but not mathematically explained, until the 19 seventies. Some living memory

456
00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:48.180
David Schaich (he): and Ken Wilson received the Nobel Prize recognition for

457
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:56.620
David Schaich (he): that mathematical derivation of how universal is explained from statistical physics. You know.

458
00:42:56.630 --> 00:43:04.160
David Schaich (he): other folks like Michael Fisher, and you know. probably deserved. do deserve a big chunk of the credit

459
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:06.520
David Schaich (he): revealing

460
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:12.870
David Schaich (he): We're contributing to that mathematical debt, Description and proof of

461
00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.150
David Schaich (he): of universities rises.

462
00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.130
David Schaich (he): So

463
00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:22.790
David Schaich (he): take a break in a few minutes.

464
00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.750
David Schaich (he): and I think there is a natural point to do so.

465
00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:31.690
David Schaich (he): Let me answer one final question about we feel approximation.

466
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:37.580
David Schaich (he): I'll first, just for Sec to see if there are questions about the predictions that we have found.

467
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:40.160
David Schaich (he): So

468
00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:45.170
David Schaich (he): I just

469
00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:54.350
David Schaich (he): right now, a brief summary of those predictions over vanishing magnetic field. We have

470
00:43:56.070 --> 00:44:05.450
David Schaich (he): the second order. these transition a critical temperature that is twice the number of dimensions, any critical X phones that is a half; that

471
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:19.210
David Schaich (he): the mean field approximation by giving us a non interacting system made all of that quite easy to calculate. So i'm not too surprised. There are questions about it.

472
00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:23.860
David Schaich (he): Maybe one question that is on your mind is.

473
00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.340
David Schaich (he): Are these predictions actually correct?

474
00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:35.440
David Schaich (he): After all, we

475
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:39.850
David Schaich (he): have me in an approximation to

476
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:44.170
David Schaich (he): derive this mean field form of the energy leading to

477
00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:47.710
David Schaich (he): self-consistency. Condition and predictions

478
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:54.570
David Schaich (he): show here. and it could well be that this approximation is

479
00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:58.180
David Schaich (he): unreliable, especially around the phase transition.

480
00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.840
David Schaich (he): What are the interesting things.

481
00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.550
Non-trivial things

482
00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:04.220
David Schaich (he): are happy to me. And

483
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:10.960
David Schaich (he): I forgot to mention that the start of today's lecture just reviewing the logistics of last week

484
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.910
David Schaich (he): to make up for the other Bank Holiday

485
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:23.750
David Schaich (he): earlier this month. There are a couple of supplemental Pencasts up on canvas, one more to be recorded either later, today or tomorrow.

486
00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:36.860
David Schaich (he): we are in the recorded. On Friday we went through the exact solution for the one-dimensional using model which using himself did

487
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:40.610
David Schaich (he): as his Phd project in the 1920 S.

488
00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:42.800
David Schaich (he): Finding that

489
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.790
David Schaich (he): in one dimensions or what to mention

490
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:50.820
David Schaich (he): there is no please transition at all. The

491
00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:54.320
David Schaich (he): using model is always

492
00:45:56.010 --> 00:46:00.410
David Schaich (he): in the disorder phase, even if absolute 0 temperature. which

493
00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:05.920
David Schaich (he): sort of strike that he disagrees with the predictions of the mean field model.

494
00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:15.510
David Schaich (he): Here we predicted the second order phase transition at the critical temperature of 2. Also, in that supplements

495
00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:17.630
David Schaich (he): we

496
00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:31.020
David Schaich (he): looked at the critical temperature for the 2D using model with 0 embedded field which i'll figure this exact solution from the 1940 S.

497
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:41.420
David Schaich (he): To be able to show there was a there is a second order. Please transition. so that at least is

498
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:46.450
David Schaich (he): consistent with our prediction from the mean feel approximation. So

499
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.970
David Schaich (he): things are getting better. We computed in that supplements that the

500
00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.990
David Schaich (he): pretty cool temperature of this. These transition.

501
00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:58.820
David Schaich (he): which is given both by on figures exact solution.

502
00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:05.660
David Schaich (he): that is. and we have time to

503
00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:09.150
David Schaich (he): apply it rather than derive it. You give us

504
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.480
David Schaich (he): a critical temperature. It is approximately

505
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:20.380
David Schaich (he): 2 and a quarter. 2.2, 7, with 8

506
00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:25.180
David Schaich (he): complicated mark. Cinch. That gives us this.

507
00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:26.870
It's a

508
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:30.330
David Schaich (he): so. The mean field.

509
00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:42.660
David Schaich (he): Critical temperature of 2D equals 4 is all by about a factor of 2 little less than pack group 2 compared to 2.2, 7

510
00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:53.280
David Schaich (he): frame was wanting. A duality does not tell us anything about the critical exponents exact solution does. I can just tell you that

511
00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:59.040
David Schaich (he): the 2D 0 people using model critical exponents. For the maximization is 1 8.

512
00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:03.200
David Schaich (he): So the one half of the new field

513
00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:05.760
David Schaich (he): approximation is off fine

514
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:15.870
David Schaich (he): a factor of 4. So the qualitative picture of the second order phase transition. He is now

515
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:18.490
captured by the new fuel approximation.

516
00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:27.730
David Schaich (he): but the quantitative details of the critical temperature and critical exponents are off by some fairly large factors.

517
00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:33.520
David Schaich (he): If we go up even higher to 3 dimensions.

518
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:37.140
David Schaich (he): there is no known exact solution for

519
00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:44.950
David Schaich (he): it, using model in 3 dimensions, even with 0 magnetic field. But we can

520
00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:50.790
David Schaich (he): analyze those systems numerically, which will be the subject of the second half of

521
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.620
David Schaich (he): this morning's lecture. and those

522
00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:57.690
David Schaich (he): numerical analysis

523
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:04.560
David Schaich (he): indicate that we still have the second order. Please transition

524
00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:07.400
David Schaich (he): a critical temperature around

525
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:13.300
David Schaich (he): 4.5 compared to the 6 of the main fuel approximation

526
00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:19.780
David Schaich (he): any critical exponents of just under a third of point 3, 2,

527
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:24.420
David Schaich (he): the same purple exponent as a liquid gas phase, transition

528
00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:35.060
David Schaich (he): as the manifestation of universality. And these numerical analysis is our very generally applicable. We can carry them out in

529
00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:40.800
David Schaich (he): larger numbers of dimensions so long as that the missionality remains finite.

530
00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.190
David Schaich (he): and

531
00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:47.560
David Schaich (he): they predict a continuing second order phase transition.

532
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:48.730
David Schaich (he): Hey, you

533
00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:52.430
David Schaich (he): Databet! Sorry

534
00:49:52.560 --> 00:50:02.050
David Schaich (he): it does now agree with the mean field. What have. and a credible temperature that, in fact approaches

535
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.790
David Schaich (he): to the

536
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:08.810
David Schaich (he): as the number of dimensions goes to infinity.

537
00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:10.090
David Schaich (he): so

538
00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:12.550
David Schaich (he): be, you know.

539
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:20.980
David Schaich (he): ultimate conclusion that we can draw is that the need for approximation is getting better and better and better as the number of dimensions increases

540
00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:24.200
David Schaich (he): in our using model. and, in fact.

541
00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:29.920
David Schaich (he): it becomes an exact solution

542
00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.060
David Schaich (he): in the limits.

543
00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:39.260
David Schaich (he): Oh, an infinite number of dimensions.

544
00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:43.630
David Schaich (he): And the reason for that is that

545
00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:47.300
David Schaich (he): each site that has

546
00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.900
David Schaich (he): infinite number of

547
00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:57.390
David Schaich (he): nearest neighbor spins to average over. so the

548
00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:03.750
David Schaich (he): approximation of the interaction as

549
00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:14.320
David Schaich (he): as an average over yeah

550
00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:23.680
David Schaich (he): spins, multiplied by the nearest neighbors becomes exactly this limit when there is an infinite amount of information

551
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.050
David Schaich (he): giving a exact

552
00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:30.640
David Schaich (he): average for the me value of the spin

553
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:36.230
David Schaich (he): from the number of years neighbors of each site that's getting back to.

554
00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:38.080
David Schaich (he): Yeah

555
00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:45.160
David Schaich (he): structure of that me feel approximation that we emphasize at the very start of today.

556
00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:46.410
David Schaich (he): We are

557
00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.910
David Schaich (he): including our effective magnetic field. hey?

558
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:55.790
David Schaich (he): Something between that means spin and 2D. And there's neighbors of each.

559
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:59.710
David Schaich (he): and that approximation it becomes exact

560
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:06.980
David Schaich (he): when each span has an infinite amount of nearest neighbors to average over.

561
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:13.620
David Schaich (he): and that is all there is to say on this module without the

562
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:16.570
David Schaich (he): we feel approximation. I'll take a

563
00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:17.690
David Schaich (he): break

564
00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:23.280
David Schaich (he): and start up a few minutes after the hour, because we've got a few minutes

565
00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:26.260
David Schaich (he): over the the first half. Just a

566
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:30.800
David Schaich (he): any questions about the

567
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:34.030
David Schaich (he): before I pause the recording.

568
00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:36.870
David Schaich (he): Let's take our lives.

569
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:41.380
David Schaich (he): Get ready for

570
00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:45.250
David Schaich (he): numerical analysis of interacting statistical systems.

571
00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:56.360
David Schaich (he): Alright the

572
00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:59.520
David Schaich (he): recording should be yet resumed it.

573
00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:06.000
David Schaich (he): check for any questions that occur to you here in the break before we

574
00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:07.670
David Schaich (he): 1 2,

575
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:13.540
David Schaich (he): the second half of the final lecture.

576
00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:19.380
David Schaich (he): which will focus on

577
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:22.410
David Schaich (he): numerical analysis.

578
00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:24.950
David Schaich (he): interacting statistical systems.

579
00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:36.240
David Schaich (he): So some connections to the computer project, where we looked at a random walking diffusion without any interactions.

580
00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:47.280
David Schaich (he): Miracle analyses were needed there to explore a little of anomalous diffusion which could be captured by

581
00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:53.230
David Schaich (he): the central limit 0 due to the not existence

582
00:53:53.340 --> 00:54:00.140
David Schaich (he): of the mean standard deviation for ecosystem Lorentz distribution. Here we've mentioned that

583
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:02.000
David Schaich (he): you're going to

584
00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:05.300
David Schaich (he): needed for the easy model

585
00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.220
David Schaich (he): accepted

586
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:19.390
David Schaich (he): special low dimensional situations. 0 field case with 2 dimensions, or the exactly one-dimensional case

587
00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:24.300
David Schaich (he): and of course, the easy model is

588
00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:30.960
David Schaich (he): something we're looking at, because it's the simplest possible system with interactions to the fact that we already need

589
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:42.510
David Schaich (he): the miracle on the for using model, and 3 or higher numbers of dimensions. Approximation comes exact.

590
00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:50.940
David Schaich (he): makes it unsurprising that for essentially all other interacting statistical systems.

591
00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:58.940
David Schaich (he): we also need numerical analyses to good.

592
00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:06.140
David Schaich (he): fully reliable and systematically improvable predictions or things like

593
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:17.000
David Schaich (he): pretty cool exponents, or the parameters. or even the existence of face transitions. In the first place. what we've been seeing and some of the tutorials are clever ways of approximating

594
00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:23.960
David Schaich (he): these interacting systems by not interacting, set up sleeping field approximations. One example of that

595
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:34.410
David Schaich (he): particularly number one, where. and interacting a rate of atoms, it's

596
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:39.310
David Schaich (he): model as a 3 non-interacting ideal gas of phones.

597
00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:46.230
David Schaich (he): But that is still an approximation. and numerical analyses of material properties is

598
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:49.300
David Schaich (he): a big industry. These days

599
00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:52.160
David Schaich (he): the applications to

600
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:55.530
David Schaich (he): all sorts of things, from energy efficiency to

601
00:55:56.570 --> 00:56:00.480
David Schaich (he): just better and faster performance of the electronics.

602
00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:11.920
David Schaich (he): So it's worth spending The last hour of lectures on how these numerical analyses are carried out in the modern day. So

603
00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:18.260
David Schaich (he): when we first introduced the using model and considered what would be needed for a group force

604
00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:19.720
David Schaich (he): numerical

605
00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:26.200
David Schaich (he): analysis of all of the microstates of a tiny 10 by 10

606
00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:28.360
David Schaich (he): to the easy model.

607
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:31.200
David Schaich (he): You can recall that

608
00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:43.850
David Schaich (he): you found it computation that some reasonable approximations would take something like 500 times sorry, 500,000 times the age of the universe

609
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:47.690
David Schaich (he): to

610
00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:51.440
David Schaich (he): actually compute partition function Oops

611
00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:53.170
David Schaich (he): for

612
00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.860
David Schaich (he): a tiny system that had it out

613
00:56:58.070 --> 00:57:10.020
David Schaich (he): 10 to the power. 32 terms appearing in the partition function, 10 to the 30 of those from some over configurations. And then another factor of 100, from the number of

614
00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:11.930
David Schaich (he): links

615
00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:15.400
David Schaich (he): in each spin configuration

616
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:24.890
David Schaich (he): and the State. Perhaps the obvious

617
00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:31.260
David Schaich (he): numerical calculations that are theory not in practice, Don't, evaluate all of those

618
00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:36.000
David Schaich (he): 10 to the 30. It's been configurations. Instead.

619
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.990
David Schaich (he): we proceed by sampling a small subset

620
00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:49.370
David Schaich (he): of those configurations for a small subset of the microstates more generally.

621
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:54.630
David Schaich (he): So this window Okay.

622
00:57:56.130 --> 00:57:57.480
David Schaich (he): in this picking up.

623
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.730
David Schaich (he): and this gives us

624
00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.690
David Schaich (he): approximate predictions or

625
00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:11.780
David Schaich (he): arbitrary expectation values, although

626
00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:12.920
David Schaich (he): where

627
00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:16.870
David Schaich (he): that oh, it's pop up already at the start of today.

628
00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:22.010
David Schaich (he): your members the sum over all microstates of the value of this

629
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:26.480
David Schaich (he): observable, whatever it is, the organization, internal energy.

630
00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:34.150
David Schaich (he): more more complicated objects like.

631
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:39.340
David Schaich (he): and a topological one, Susceptibilities. This P. Is

632
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:45.960
David Schaich (he): the Bolton factor weighted by the partition function. So we have both the numerator and denominator

633
00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:50.510
David Schaich (he): sums over all the microstates that we approximate my

634
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:55.580
David Schaich (he): not something over all the microstates, something only over the subset.

635
00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:56.610
David Schaich (he): and

636
00:58:58.660 --> 00:58:59.980
David Schaich (he): in particular.

637
00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:03.080
David Schaich (he): the question is our

638
00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:15.470
David Schaich (he): because that subset have to be. How many of these Microsoft we probably need to analyze. We can anticipate that it will be small, subset. and

639
00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:20.970
David Schaich (he): we can also anticipate the work that we did on random box.

640
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:22.130
David Schaich (he): that the

641
00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:25.330
David Schaich (he): selection of the subset

642
00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.130
David Schaich (he): will involve some level of

643
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:36.900
David Schaich (he): to the randomness. So the sampling is done as randomly as we and

644
00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:40.320
David Schaich (he): on the computer

645
00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:52.150
David Schaich (he): which the role of randomness in these numerical analyses you then we call it basically Monte Carlo methods

646
00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:55.190
David Schaich (he): just named after the

647
00:59:58.810 --> 00:59:59.600
David Schaich (he): where

648
01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:10.690
David Schaich (he): random this plays every role in and within. So do you simplest example. We can look at to

649
01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.480
David Schaich (he): show basic idea of how

650
01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.600
David Schaich (he): this could be carried out is

651
01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.500
David Schaich (he): just computing an integral.

652
01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:25.700
David Schaich (he): my evaluating

653
01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.240
David Schaich (he): the integrand

654
01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:28.920
so.

655
01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.930
David Schaich (he): and we randomly select the points of the domain

656
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:44.960
David Schaich (he): at which to evaluate the integrand. and then

657
01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.680
David Schaich (he): adding up the

658
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:53.510
David Schaich (he): contribution, gives us an estimate for the value of the integral as a whole.

659
01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:55.250
David Schaich (he): As you

660
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:59.630
David Schaich (he): conceptual illustration, we have some function F.

661
01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.080
That might have some complicated

662
01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:12.310
David Schaich (he): I want on to integrate. We have this domain Hex. We randomly sample a few points in X

663
01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:15.620
David Schaich (he): might end up close or far from each other.

664
01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:24.110
David Schaich (he): The idea is that by evaluating the integrated all those points. and filling in a sufficient number of points

665
01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:27.300
a good approximation to

666
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:30.580
David Schaich (he): the overall result for the integral.

667
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:38.940
David Schaich (he): The danger here is that I've drawn the points of it too regularly. They're all being sampled randomly. But if there are enough.

668
01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.770
David Schaich (he): we can rest assured that they will

669
01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:46.220
David Schaich (he): cover the domain, sample things

670
01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.800
David Schaich (he): with a reasonable density.

671
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:54.120
David Schaich (he): and give us a control approximation for the value of the integral

672
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:58.200
David Schaich (he): that improves as more and more samples are

673
01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.420
David Schaich (he): computer.

674
01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:03.580
David Schaich (he): So here's a fun application of

675
01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:10.570
David Schaich (he): this integrating approach. That shows how it can go beyond just a one-dimensional function of a single variable.

676
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:15.670
David Schaich (he): If we imagine integrating over 2 variables X and Y,

677
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:21.830
David Schaich (he): the so called heavy side step function

678
01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.790
David Schaich (he): as a function of

679
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:30.400
David Schaich (he): x squared plus y squared. So this h

680
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:33.740
David Schaich (he): some value are in this case.

681
01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:37.810
David Schaich (he): R. Is this function one minus x squared plus y squared.

682
01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:50.500
David Schaich (he): The step function is defined to be either one or 0. It is one when our is greater than or equal to 0 0. Otherwise.

683
01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:55.220
David Schaich (he): so you can see that

684
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:59.310
David Schaich (he): the integrand of this integral is

685
01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:01.270
David Schaich (he): going to be one

686
01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:06.350
David Schaich (he): another. X and Y are sufficiently small that they're

687
01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:10.700
David Schaich (he): the some of their squares is less than one, and the

688
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:12.100
David Schaich (he): argument, all of it.

689
01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:15.300
David Schaich (he): The heavy side step function ends up positive

690
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:18.300
David Schaich (he): on this.

691
01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:22.060
David Schaich (he): The integrand is 0, otherwise. So what we have

692
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:23.140
David Schaich (he): is.

693
01:03:25.790 --> 01:03:28.970
David Schaich (he): hey? This defined by

694
01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:34.970
David Schaich (he): the of one in X and Y that be

695
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:39.010
David Schaich (he): are integrating over within the

696
01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:43.080
David Schaich (he): full integration domain that is, the square of X and Y,

697
01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.390
David Schaich (he): or minus one.

698
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:47.110
David Schaich (he): So

699
01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.750
David Schaich (he): this

700
01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:54.670
David Schaich (he): area of the disc with radius

701
01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:00.240
David Schaich (he): r equals one is

702
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:04.570
David Schaich (he): I r squared, one squared is one.

703
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:10.390
David Schaich (he): So this integral that we can evaluate numerically with random sampling

704
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.830
David Schaich (he): will give us an estimate for

705
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:14.790
all right.

706
01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:17.640
David Schaich (he): This is illustrated

707
01:04:17.650 --> 01:04:19.810
David Schaich (he): here. This is just that

708
01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:24.050
David Schaich (he): you to disk. No, either through just before

709
01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:36.540
David Schaich (he): show my deal black, solid curve. It is within the integration domain. and the green points are all random samples of X and Y.

710
01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:37.920
David Schaich (he): I define it

711
01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:44.990
David Schaich (he): points in that integration domain. The integrand is either one inside the disc 0 outside.

712
01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:54.280
David Schaich (he): So the fraction of points that land inside the disc is the area of that disc I

713
01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:57.920
David Schaich (he): divided by the area of the school domain, which is 4.

714
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:03.170
David Schaich (he): So it this is a sampling problem that

715
01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:12.540
David Schaich (he): you know. have all the tools to do from the computer project. There is code link from the lecture notes to do it. It just looks like this. It's on

716
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:15.840
David Schaich (he): a single screen, just a few lines.

717
01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:25.760
David Schaich (he): and it goes through some number of samples to carry out this process of randomly

718
01:05:27.830 --> 01:05:33.710
David Schaich (he): sampling points within the range, minus one to one. We know how random random works.

719
01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:43.170
David Schaich (he): We evaluate the integrand normalize it by the full domain, and this should give an estimate for

720
01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:44.670
David Schaich (he): Hi.

721
01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:51.110
David Schaich (he): with some statistical uncertainty related to the number of points that we throw at this domain.

722
01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:01.080
David Schaich (he): So when we throw a 1 million points, for example. we find that pi is 3.1, 4, one plus or minus 0 point 0 0 6, which is correct.

723
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:05.860
David Schaich (he): We get that within about a second running on Google's co-lab

724
01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:10.120
David Schaich (he): and i'll just leave this running while we go back to

725
01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.830
David Schaich (he): the projector

726
01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:20.860
David Schaich (he): the documents as we get up to a 1 billionsamples and see how long that might take.

727
01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.460
David Schaich (he): So that's the the basic idea

728
01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:37.910
David Schaich (he): of Monte Carlo integration. and there are

729
01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:41.940
David Schaich (he): some immediate concerns that you may have, that I will

730
01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.610
David Schaich (he): try to address

731
01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:56.400
David Schaich (he): hopefully address and feel free to shout out additional concerns. I don't get to them. One concern might be that

732
01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:59.200
David Schaich (he): this is kind of the dumb way to go, because

733
01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:06.350
David Schaich (he): you can see we're already spending minutes computing pi to 3 or 4 decimal places.

734
01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:09.450
David Schaich (he): Where is that to be better

735
01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:18.060
David Schaich (he): predictions? For I can be obtained much more quickly, numerically, by considering certain power series expansions.

736
01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:23.910
David Schaich (he): and similarly. when evaluating integrals in America. it is

737
01:07:23.970 --> 01:07:28.780
David Schaich (he): generally not optimal just in this one-dimensional case to randomly choose

738
01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:31.080
David Schaich (he): the points at which to evaluate the integral.

739
01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:34.940
David Schaich (he): It makes more sense to uniformly scan

740
01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:37.270
David Schaich (he): that ready to evaluate some

741
01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:40.680
David Schaich (he): regular

742
01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.940
David Schaich (he): set of points.

743
01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:50.590
David Schaich (he): use that in a. to get an approximation to that integral that becomes exact as those

744
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:54.520
David Schaich (he): regularly space points become closer closer to each other.

745
01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:01.250
David Schaich (he): and I will admit that this sort of random sampling is not so useful in

746
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:05.860
David Schaich (he): lower numbers of dimensions. Where the form of the integral is noon.

747
01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:09.070
David Schaich (he): it really becomes most useful.

748
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:13.520
David Schaich (he): We have hi dimensional

749
01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.439
David Schaich (he): integrals to consider.

750
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:19.180
David Schaich (he): especially when

751
01:08:20.779 --> 01:08:21.740
David Schaich (he): the

752
01:08:22.770 --> 01:08:27.920
David Schaich (he): functional form is something that is not obvious. Like in

753
01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:33.050
David Schaich (he): the statistical physics context. Not surprisingly.

754
01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:36.050
David Schaich (he): we are

755
01:08:39.819 --> 01:08:41.350
David Schaich (he): functional form

756
01:08:41.710 --> 01:08:56.359
David Schaich (he): up the Boltzmann or the Gibbs distribution depends on summing over the buls and factors. Even the latest data types of energy for some exponentially large number of microstates is something we can't predict in advance

757
01:08:56.550 --> 01:09:00.990
David Schaich (he): and actually draw down that line. We can only do the sampling

758
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:03.920
David Schaich (he): and see what we get out of it.

759
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:07.229
David Schaich (he): So

760
01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:16.399
David Schaich (he): the interacting statistical systems provide through their

761
01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:21.430
David Schaich (he): efficient functions exactly the sort of high dimensional.

762
01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:29.790
David Schaich (he): integral for which these numerical methods are most useful.

763
01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.010
David Schaich (he): Involved in.

764
01:09:34.350 --> 01:09:38.510
David Schaich (he): We have a degrees of freedom.

765
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:48.200
David Schaich (he): And just to give an illustration. a big chunk of the ongoing research being done in the

766
01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:51.310
David Schaich (he): theoretical physics group here at Liverpool

767
01:09:51.450 --> 01:09:55.630
David Schaich (he): is exactly carrying out Monte Carlo integration for

768
01:09:55.790 --> 01:10:00.930
David Schaich (he): 1 billiondimensional interpol. So integrating over a 1 billiondegrees of freedom

769
01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:02.790
David Schaich (he): which you can keep

770
01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:09.210
David Schaich (he): the biggest supercomputers in the world busy for these 4 weeks on it.

771
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:13.910
David Schaich (he): One other you may be worried about Once we have

772
01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.430
David Schaich (he): a very high dimensional, integral with a large number of particles.

773
01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:20.350
David Schaich (he): is that the

774
01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.810
David Schaich (he): number of

775
01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:31.530
David Schaich (he): microstates that you will be considering is necessarily very small.

776
01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:35.490
David Schaich (he): So we mentioned

777
01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.690
David Schaich (he): at start that rather than

778
01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:46.770
David Schaich (he): doing a full brute force, numerical connotation with all the microstates

779
01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:53.460
David Schaich (he): which could take many times longer than the age of the universe. We sample a small subset.

780
01:10:55.380 --> 01:11:02.510
David Schaich (he): How large that sample is. We can appreciate just by how long the calculations are taking to run.

781
01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:09.660
David Schaich (he): So the fraction the ratio of the microstates we consider.

782
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:11.020
Okay.

783
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:15.280
David Schaich (he): This fraction is probably going to be given by the

784
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:20.060
David Schaich (he): length of the computation that we do something that might take

785
01:11:21.170 --> 01:11:24.320
David Schaich (he): few minutes or hours, or perhaps days

786
01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.470
David Schaich (he): that has to be compared to

787
01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:32.920
David Schaich (he): many times the age of the universe that would be required to

788
01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:37.540
David Schaich (he): carrying out the full calculation. And this.

789
01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:43.270
David Schaich (he): you list to say, is a very small fraction, much less than one off in my

790
01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:44.790
David Schaich (he): some in this

791
01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:46.570
David Schaich (he): all right.

792
01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:49.680
David Schaich (he): Enormous factor, like the

793
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:53.790
David Schaich (he): with even at those 10 to the 32 terms you could

794
01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.040
David Schaich (he): only get perhaps one part in 10 to the 18 of them.

795
01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.180
David Schaich (he): So one

796
01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:10.700
David Schaich (he): 1 billion of the total number of microstates and a reasonable question is. How can, looking at such a vanishingly small fraction

797
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:14.110
David Schaich (he): of the possible microstates of the system.

798
01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:21.020
David Schaich (he): Also, we give us reliable approximate expectation values

799
01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:31.250
David Schaich (he): in any computation that we can do on human time scales.

800
01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:42.930
David Schaich (he): So this question we can sort of dig into by

801
01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.460
David Schaich (he): turning specifically to

802
01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:48.140
David Schaich (he): the using model

803
01:12:53.430 --> 01:13:01.520
David Schaich (he): and recalling the sort of behavior that we expect in the high. In the temperature limits

804
01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:05.490
David Schaich (he): we are high t limit.

805
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:09.740
David Schaich (he): You can't remember that

806
01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:14.220
David Schaich (he): all of the microstates

807
01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.630
David Schaich (he): are equally probable.

808
01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:28.720
David Schaich (he): and i'll approach that one over to the power end. Our ability and expectation values are there for.

809
01:13:30.170 --> 01:13:33.030
David Schaich (he): determined by the degeneracy

810
01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:37.980
David Schaich (he): of microstates with

811
01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:41.850
David Schaich (he): certain values of that a variable like the energy.

812
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.430
David Schaich (he): We saw this in the tutorial as well.

813
01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:46.790
David Schaich (he): that

814
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:57.100
David Schaich (he): there are that poorly large numbers of microstates that essentially dominate the whole entropy of the system as similarly. For

815
01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:00.270
David Schaich (he): so the

816
01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:12.070
David Schaich (he): energy levels or other levels with higher degeneracies, there are more micro-states. Those are

817
01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:16.280
David Schaich (he): just more likely to be random Singapore.

818
01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:25.710
David Schaich (he): So if we just

819
01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:40.930
David Schaich (he): compute a small number of samples. There is a very good chance that it is. Only there's large degeneracy regimes that will actually be seen.

820
01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:49.910
David Schaich (he): Unfortunately, those are exactly the regimes that we need in order to determine our expectation values. So in this

821
01:14:52.230 --> 01:14:54.600
David Schaich (he): regime we could imagine

822
01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:59.390
David Schaich (he): you randomly sampling microstates could be an okay way to

823
01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:06.150
David Schaich (he): you follow reliable approximates predictions for these observables.

824
01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:10.840
David Schaich (he): The opposite seems to be through the low temperature limits.

825
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:16.060
David Schaich (he): We saw that the

826
01:15:17.170 --> 01:15:21.110
David Schaich (he): ground states with the lowest energy level dominated

827
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:23.570
all expectation values.

828
01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:28.290
David Schaich (he): thanks to

829
01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:32.500
David Schaich (he): having the minimum energy, and therefore the

830
01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.640
David Schaich (he): largest molten factor.

831
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:37.640
David Schaich (he): So all

832
01:15:38.970 --> 01:15:40.510
David Schaich (he): other microstates.

833
01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:48.480
David Schaich (he): your contributions to expectation values

834
01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:51.600
David Schaich (he): that are

835
01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:54.220
David Schaich (he): exponentially

836
01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:57.370
David Schaich (he): suppressed like that. He didn't mind this

837
01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:02.360
David Schaich (he): beta times the internal energy. And here

838
01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:10.020
David Schaich (he): the chances of randomly sampling just a single or a small number of ground states out of the whole 2 to the end.

839
01:16:10.570 --> 01:16:21.340
David Schaich (he): Us. Microstates that we have available in the user model is essentially 0. So if we just randomly. he microstates to look at.

840
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:23.590
David Schaich (he): There is

841
01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:28.630
David Schaich (he): essentially no chance that we will get anything remotely correct in this low temperature limit.

842
01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:33.900
David Schaich (he): The solution to this case.

843
01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:40.440
David Schaich (he): maybe suggested by what I described as not to sample things completely, randomly.

844
01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.820
David Schaich (he): But instead of incorporate

845
01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:47.990
David Schaich (he): this probability of given by the Boltzmann factor into

846
01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:53.950
David Schaich (he): you see the random sampling. So you want to sample like I say it's something that I,

847
01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.940
David Schaich (he): with the probability

848
01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:02.350
David Schaich (he): that is proportional

849
01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:05.550
David Schaich (he): to their Boltzmann factors.

850
01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:12.980
David Schaich (he): This is easier said than done.

851
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:15.910
David Schaich (he): because. of course, we can't

852
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:18.980
David Schaich (he): evaluate those balson factors

853
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:29.680
David Schaich (he): without going through the exponentially large number of microstates doing the full root force calculation that we were trying to avoid by sampling. In the first case we need to be.

854
01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:31.790
David Schaich (he): I did.

855
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:36.230
David Schaich (he): however. and how we proceed.

856
01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:39.770
David Schaich (he): because we don't actually do the

857
01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:45.240
David Schaich (he): distribution in advance as we do the sampling.

858
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:49.590
David Schaich (he): So what we need

859
01:17:52.810 --> 01:17:54.360
David Schaich (he): this gives us our

860
01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:57.020
David Schaich (he): approaches known as importance sampling

861
01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:58.660
David Schaich (he): algorithms.

862
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:06.810
David Schaich (he): An algorithm is just the set of

863
01:18:06.850 --> 01:18:11.150
David Schaich (he): steps that is given to the computer to instruct it what to do.

864
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:13.660
David Schaich (he): So the random box that you

865
01:18:14.410 --> 01:18:18.900
David Schaich (he): put it up in the computer project for an example of an algorithm

866
01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:21.800
David Schaich (he): important to sampling algorithms

867
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:34.550
David Schaich (he): do essentially what they see on the 10, Dave Fine. the important

868
01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:38.910
David Schaich (he): microstates with large probabilities.

869
01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.690
David Schaich (he): I

870
01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:49.640
David Schaich (he): large the I, without knowing the distribution probabilities.

871
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:52.220
David Schaich (he): and without introducing.

872
01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:54.180
David Schaich (he): If you buy this

873
01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:57.440
David Schaich (he): through the use of

874
01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:05.300
David Schaich (he): pseudo randomness. so some, our stochastic sampling

875
01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:10.740
David Schaich (he): in these approaches is designed in such a way to

876
01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:16.240
David Schaich (he): guide sampling to the important microstates the ones that actually contribute

877
01:19:16.530 --> 01:19:17.560
David Schaich (he): to

878
01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:20.280
David Schaich (he): the

879
01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:23.190
David Schaich (he): expectation values.

880
01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:29.400
David Schaich (he): Whether or not we are in a high temperature or low temperature regime.

881
01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:32.630
David Schaich (he): where we have different behaviors; for

882
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:37.290
David Schaich (he): how those expectation values correspond to the full set of micro states.

883
01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:44.670
David Schaich (he): So there is time remaining to give a concrete example of this

884
01:19:47.230 --> 01:19:53.720
David Schaich (he): what I will call Yeah. Mr. Rtt algorithm

885
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:59.470
David Schaich (he): from 1,953. What are the

886
01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:04.010
David Schaich (he): most famous algorithms in the history of computing

887
01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:05.130
David Schaich (he): the

888
01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:12.630
David Schaich (he): the paper that the article in the journal that introduced this algorithm actually has its own Wikipedia article. It is

889
01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:16.090
David Schaich (he): one of the

890
01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:18.760
David Schaich (he): the history of science.

891
01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:22.830
David Schaich (he): and it is often known as the metropolis, algorithm

892
01:20:22.930 --> 01:20:24.570
David Schaich (he): because that is the

893
01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:29.250
David Schaich (he): last name of Mick metropolis. The first of the 5 authors on

894
01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:34.030
David Schaich (he): That's that article, that application. and is

895
01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:38.210
David Schaich (he): extremely unfair to call this the metropolis algorithm

896
01:20:38.230 --> 01:20:40.110
David Schaich (he): because Metropolis himself

897
01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:45.200
David Schaich (he): actually didn't play a role in designing the output. He was a

898
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:49.700
David Schaich (he): computer engineer back in the 1940 S. And 50 S.

899
01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:53.830
David Schaich (he): Primitive computers. Essentially, by scratch.

900
01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.580
David Schaich (he): persist. do you

901
01:20:58.450 --> 01:21:11.800
David Schaich (he): more effort and Mobile to the algorithm, itself, was designed for merely by. and especially by the R. And R. You are Arizona and Marshall

902
01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:13.300
David Schaich (he): husband is like.

903
01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:17.430
David Schaich (he): along with Mishi teller and Edward Teller.

904
01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.380
David Schaich (he): another husband and white pair.

905
01:21:21.130 --> 01:21:25.210
David Schaich (he): The basic story behind this is that Edward Teller had

906
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:30.650
David Schaich (he): the basic idea of how this algorithm would work that will go through it just a minute.

907
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:33.520
David Schaich (he): Marshall Rosen will

908
01:21:34.090 --> 01:21:39.560
David Schaich (he): refine that idea to some extent. V. She tell her, started an initial

909
01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:40.530
David Schaich (he): bye

910
01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:47.790
David Schaich (he): programming implementation of this. Back in the early 50 years before things like programming languages existed.

911
01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:57.050
David Schaich (he): all the programming had to be done in terms of machine code is like bits and assembly instructions. and then ari on the

912
01:21:57.230 --> 01:22:03.070
David Schaich (he): also refined, the ideal, and produce the final code that was used

913
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:06.170
David Schaich (he): to carry out a numerical computation

914
01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:09.120
David Schaich (he): of the pressure of a gas of

915
01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:16.080
David Schaich (he): steers in 2 dimensions. something that took Metropolis

916
01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:24.040
David Schaich (he): computer a few days to cry it through. You can now do essentially, instantaneously on your cell phone.

917
01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:31.320
David Schaich (he): thanks to the progress of the underlying computer technology. So enough about the sociology of

918
01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.080
David Schaich (he): who should get credit for this algorithm

919
01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:40.370
David Schaich (he): let's talk about the algorithm itself. We're

920
01:22:42.330 --> 01:22:44.330
David Schaich (he): The idea is to

921
01:22:46.330 --> 01:22:49.840
David Schaich (he): do the sampling by starting with

922
01:22:50.150 --> 01:22:53.140
David Schaich (he): some microstate, some spin configuration

923
01:22:58.110 --> 01:22:59.070
David Schaich (he): and

924
01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:14.720
David Schaich (he): doing so, acting on it in some way, making some change to provide the next microstate to sample, rather than generating one completely, independently from scratch.

925
01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:16.770
David Schaich (he): So we

926
01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:20.670
David Schaich (he): make a pseudo-random

927
01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.080
David Schaich (he): change to the microstate

928
01:23:28.890 --> 01:23:30.840
David Schaich (he): which changes its energy

929
01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:34.380
David Schaich (he): by some amount delta E. So.

930
01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:44.740
David Schaich (he): thinking of the easy model to make this concrete over on the side here, we can say that that microstate is a spin configuration.

931
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:51.180
David Schaich (he): The only pseudo random change we can do is select a

932
01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:58.290
David Schaich (he): random spin Sj. and then the only change we can make to that. Sj. Is

933
01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:12.260
David Schaich (he): so the getting its value, just as we did to confirm that the easy model was an interacting statistical system. and then the

934
01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:15.900
David Schaich (he): change is accepted

935
01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:25.620
David Schaich (he): into the microstates. the easy model. the

936
01:24:27.850 --> 01:24:42.350
David Schaich (he): the spin configuration is updated with the flip spin with the probability which is at most 100%. I can also be smaller. This exponential factor.

937
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:48.340
David Schaich (he): E to the minus P. That delta energy is less than one.

938
01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:52.400
David Schaich (he): so that's acceptance

939
01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:03.660
David Schaich (he): will fix that change in the microstates. If we don't accept. we reject the change.

940
01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:10.350
David Schaich (he): Keep the Microsoft that we previously had. Yeah.

941
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:14.800
David Schaich (he): that gives us either way

942
01:25:16.190 --> 01:25:17.880
David Schaich (he): the new microstates

943
01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:23.190
David Schaich (he): that may well be

944
01:25:24.330 --> 01:25:27.340
David Schaich (he): unchanged compared to the previous one.

945
01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:35.220
David Schaich (he): That probability one minus P. And except.

946
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:40.580
David Schaich (he): and then we repeat

947
01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:44.090
David Schaich (he): this as long as our

948
01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:48.090
David Schaich (he): computers can run to keep sampling microstates

949
01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:57.420
David Schaich (he): in this way. So, just as a quick standard you check, we can look to the I and loose have the true limits.

950
01:25:58.050 --> 01:26:02.340
David Schaich (he): and we were considered to the easy model in the low temperature limits. We want to

951
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:06.060
David Schaich (he): to find the ground state and stay there.

952
01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.890
David Schaich (he): In this approach we can see that

953
01:26:10.150 --> 01:26:13.380
David Schaich (he): if the energy decreases

954
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:23.540
David Schaich (he): so delta e is less than 0, this exponential factor is greater than one, and it change is always accepted. We will keep accepting changes that take us closer to the ground state.

955
01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:33.210
David Schaich (he): and once we are there. and a low temperature within large beta. any change away from the ground State will increase the energy

956
01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:40.750
David Schaich (he): and give an exponentially suppressed acceptance probability. So we will just keep sampling the ground, state over and over again.

957
01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:48.400
David Schaich (he): or sufficiently low temperatures. which is exactly what we want to do to compute expectation values that are

958
01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:51.900
David Schaich (he): dominated by that ground state. So

959
01:26:52.210 --> 01:26:54.980
David Schaich (he): in that limit, at least. this is

960
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:57.160
David Schaich (he): making sense.

961
01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:00.560
And

962
01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:01.870
David Schaich (he): okay.

963
01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.700
David Schaich (he): yeah.

964
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:10.560
David Schaich (he): And

965
01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:21.050
David Schaich (he): yeah, this is actually something that we encountered way back in. I think the second week of the term

966
01:27:22.490 --> 01:27:24.770
David Schaich (he): this is sort of sequence of

967
01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:28.740
David Schaich (he): microstates that comes out of this. Algorithm

968
01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:32.010
David Schaich (he): here's an example of

969
01:27:33.850 --> 01:27:35.500
David Schaich (he): a Markov chain.

970
01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:50.170
David Schaich (he): which is a concept that we saw when talking about the random steps building up into a random walk. The position of the walker was also a Markov chain.

971
01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:54.510
David Schaich (he): and the defining characteristic of

972
01:27:54.580 --> 01:28:04.940
David Schaich (he): the Markov chain. I'll remind you from there is that each link in the chain. In this case, the micro state, being sampled. arises only from the previous link.

973
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:10.500
David Schaich (he): So each microstate is based on previous microstates.

974
01:28:11.210 --> 01:28:12.850
That would be memory

975
01:28:13.090 --> 01:28:16.150
David Schaich (he): of what came before that which simplifies

976
01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:22.640
David Schaich (he): with the practical numerical implementation of this, as well as it's mathematical

977
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:32.270
David Schaich (he): analysis. And the proofs we can make that this is unbiased and able to

978
01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:36.030
David Schaich (he): directly sample.

979
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:40.220
David Schaich (he): according to the problem that we want, without actually putting in

980
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:42.580
David Schaich (he): that probability explicitly.

981
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.870
David Schaich (he): So.

982
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:49.360
David Schaich (he): One thing we can

983
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:52.560
David Schaich (he): due to check this is.

984
01:28:52.730 --> 01:28:53.940
David Schaich (he): consider

985
01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:59.880
David Schaich (he): the relative probability of going back and forth between any pair of microstates.

986
01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:11.970
David Schaich (he): So the probability of going for microstate a microstate B compared to probability of going in the other direction. For Microsoft be

987
01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:15.540
David Schaich (he): back to Microsoft. A. In both cases

988
01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:25.420
David Schaich (he): corresponds to yeah minimum of one or e to the minus beta times. The difference.

989
01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:27.930
David Schaich (he): a final minus initial

990
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.450
David Schaich (he): energy.

991
01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:34.650
David Schaich (he): All the changes in the denominator is

992
01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:40.900
David Schaich (he): which energy is final, we a. and which is the

993
01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:45.630
David Schaich (he): there are 2 cases we could consider.

994
01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:49.480
David Schaich (he): If Eb is greater than E. A.

995
01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:50.630
David Schaich (he): Then

996
01:29:53.630 --> 01:29:55.620
David Schaich (he): in the denominator, we will

997
01:29:57.170 --> 01:30:09.010
David Schaich (he): the lowering the energy here. and always accepts with probability one and the numerator we have e to the minus the other way around. If e a. Is greater than eb.

998
01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:14.500
David Schaich (he): You get the one in the numerator and minus speed of the time, c. A. Minus E to the denominator.

999
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:18.880
David Schaich (he): Both of those are actually the same probability it's e to the minus

1000
01:30:21.010 --> 01:30:24.250
David Schaich (he): find the C. A. Either to me out directly up there

1001
01:30:24.710 --> 01:30:28.570
David Schaich (he): for the inverse of the a. By the

1002
01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:33.000
David Schaich (he): and this is nothing more than the ratio

1003
01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:39.580
David Schaich (he): of those 2 Boltzmann factors e to the minus beta eb

1004
01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:43.790
David Schaich (he): over e to the minus beta E. A. So

1005
01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:45.900
David Schaich (he): we can see that

1006
01:30:46.050 --> 01:30:49.510
David Schaich (he): this is consistent with sampling Microsoft B.

1007
01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:55.270
David Schaich (he): The probability given by it's Bolton factor, exactly the probability that we want with the

1008
01:30:55.440 --> 01:31:00.540
David Schaich (he): functionality factors cancel out in this ratio. Similarly, the probability of

1009
01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:04.940
David Schaich (he): sampling Microsoft a.

1010
01:31:05.050 --> 01:31:05.910
David Schaich (he): So

1011
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:09.220
David Schaich (he): this simple algorithm

1012
01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:19.150
David Schaich (he): is giving us the probabilistic sampling that we are after. and the one last

1013
01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:23.330
David Schaich (he): caveat on this

1014
01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:28.700
David Schaich (he): one way that

1015
01:31:30.170 --> 01:31:31.220
David Schaich (he): the

1016
01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:38.770
David Schaich (he): Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling like that, Mr. Rtt algorithm

1017
01:31:39.210 --> 01:31:43.520
David Schaich (he): avoid bias and are guaranteed mathematically to produce

1018
01:31:44.170 --> 01:31:46.280
David Schaich (he): accurate approximations to

1019
01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:50.870
David Schaich (he): the expectation values that we are. After

1020
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:55.420
David Schaich (he): this mark, I'll change the procedure of

1021
01:31:55.640 --> 01:32:00.600
David Schaich (he): making a random update to the probabilistically accepting or rejecting it

1022
01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:04.230
David Schaich (he): must in principle be able

1023
01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:11.980
David Schaich (he): to sample every possible

1024
01:32:12.570 --> 01:32:14.940
David Schaich (he): microstates in the system.

1025
01:32:15.450 --> 01:32:21.150
David Schaich (he): It can reach any microstates from any other micro state.

1026
01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:30.630
David Schaich (he): If there were some set of microstates that couldn't be reached.

1027
01:32:31.230 --> 01:32:35.210
David Schaich (he): Daniel. they might have a non-zero probability that

1028
01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:44.900
David Schaich (he): this algorithm would never sample which is a contradiction of what we were after a probability proportion to the Boltzmann factor.

1029
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:49.420
David Schaich (he): and this property of being able to

1030
01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:54.050
David Schaich (he): reach any microstate from any other microstates in principle

1031
01:32:54.780 --> 01:33:00.240
David Schaich (he): is known as periodicity, using necessary condition

1032
01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:05.210
David Schaich (he): for Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to be correct.

1033
01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:10.960
David Schaich (he): and it depends both on the

1034
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:14.560
David Schaich (he): specific

1035
01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:18.540
David Schaich (he): system, the interactions of the degrees of freedom

1036
01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:21.770
David Schaich (he): as well as

1037
01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:25.190
David Schaich (he): how the

1038
01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:30.720
David Schaich (he): microstate is

1039
01:33:30.970 --> 01:33:33.670
David Schaich (he): updated at each link of the chain.

1040
01:33:36.690 --> 01:33:41.860
David Schaich (he): So there are. So I emphasize that this is in principle necessary

1041
01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:43.970
David Schaich (he): to get the correct results.

1042
01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:47.630
David Schaich (he): because, as we've seen actually reaching

1043
01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:50.260
David Schaich (he): any microstate from any other microstates

1044
01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:59.020
David Schaich (he): is going to require a conversations that run many times. No wonder that the Asian universe.

1045
01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:02.990
David Schaich (he): so we don't actually carry out a calculation that goes through

1046
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:09.710
David Schaich (he): that those full sets it just has to be possible with a non-zero probability. To do so. So again.

1047
01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:16.450
David Schaich (he): for the simple example of the easy model. we can see that this is the case. I'm with you.

1048
01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:28.400
David Schaich (he): Non-zero temperature there. Is a non-zero probability of accepting any individual spin flip. There is a non-zero probability of selecting any one of these spins to flip.

1049
01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:36.640
David Schaich (he): So any 2 microstate is just differ by the set of spins that are pointing in different directions.

1050
01:34:37.410 --> 01:34:41.290
David Schaich (he): There is a you know, randomly selecting each of those spins.

1051
01:34:41.310 --> 01:34:47.660
David Schaich (he): flipping it and accepting that update, because from any spin configuration to any other one.

1052
01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:51.110
David Schaich (he): It's generally a exponentially suppressed.

1053
01:34:52.660 --> 01:35:01.380
David Schaich (he): I require trillions of years of computing interaction happened that doesn't matter for the

1054
01:35:02.610 --> 01:35:15.000
David Schaich (he): that bias is avoided. and the results become more accurate just as long as that is possible in principle. Speaking of more accuracy.

1055
01:35:15.450 --> 01:35:16.530
David Schaich (he): the

1056
01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:22.710
David Schaich (he): 1 billionsamples of our computation, I have finished running. In a little under 10 min

1057
01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:26.060
David Schaich (he): we find just about

1058
01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:34.120
David Schaich (he): almost 4 significant figures, 3.1 4 1 5 9. So

1059
01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:44.200
David Schaich (he): is the correct results. What we have is 3.1 4 1 6 3. So it's off by point, 0 0 4 with an uncertainty of point 0, 0, 22,

1060
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:59.740
David Schaich (he): or the uncertainty is just coming from the statistics that we have. and in particular getting back to this by us once bias is appointed

1061
01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:07.410
David Schaich (he): that uncertainty, all predictions coming from the finite sampling.

1062
01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:09.910
David Schaich (he): and be proven

1063
01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:17.850
David Schaich (he): to be proportional to one over the square root a number of samples that all.

1064
01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:24.600
David Schaich (he): So here we can see as we go.

1065
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:32.720
David Schaich (he): as we increase the number of samples by a factor of a 100, from end of the 5 to 10 to the 7 to 10 to the 9.

1066
01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:44.320
David Schaich (he): The square root of 100 is 10, and the uncertainty goes down from point o 2 to 10 times solar. 10 times smaller point, but will o 2. So it

1067
01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:48.000
David Schaich (he): and that is including. as

1068
01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:51.480
David Schaich (he): advertised, not a derivation that you have time to do.

1069
01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:52.470
David Schaich (he): but

1070
01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:56.150
David Schaich (he): the result that allows us to control

1071
01:36:56.770 --> 01:37:01.770
David Schaich (he): the accuracy with which our numerical calculations give us predictions.

1072
01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:06.660
David Schaich (he): just by increasing the number of samples. So

1073
01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:13.670
David Schaich (he): you know things like proving organicity for more complicated systems with more efficient update algorithms

1074
01:37:13.890 --> 01:37:15.990
David Schaich (he): are the kind of ongoing

1075
01:37:16.670 --> 01:37:24.510
David Schaich (he): research questions that entertain us here in the theoretical physics division at Liverpool.

1076
01:37:25.670 --> 01:37:26.480
David Schaich (he): And

1077
01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:29.190
David Schaich (he): hopefully, you are.

1078
01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:35.060
David Schaich (he): I use some crowd to him. reach the state of

1079
01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:37.910
David Schaich (he): encountering

1080
01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:40.660
David Schaich (he): ongoing research

1081
01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:48.510
David Schaich (he): just through the of this module I would you last few months.

1082
01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:53.070
David Schaich (he): Starting from the very underlying foundations of

1083
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:56.880
David Schaich (he): spaces, the

1084
01:37:57.710 --> 01:38:01.810
David Schaich (he): central to

1085
01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:10.540
David Schaich (he): applications of those 2 not interacting and interacting

1086
01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.270
David Schaich (he): statistical systems

1087
01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:20.520
David Schaich (he): that your funny thing is the yellow

1088
01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:23.740
David Schaich (he): one sentence

1089
01:38:24.570 --> 01:38:27.230
David Schaich (he): summary of the your achievements

1090
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:36.990
David Schaich (he): on this module, which I hope you are. We used to have gotten through. and

1091
01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:41.570
David Schaich (he): it's a good place to wrap up.

1092
01:38:41.730 --> 01:38:43.220
David Schaich (he): or the lectures as a whole.

1093
01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:49.250
David Schaich (he): as always. seeing if there are final questions before

1094
01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.960
David Schaich (he): I shut things down.

1095
01:38:55.890 --> 01:38:59.540
David Schaich (he): As I mentioned in the announcements, one last set of office hours

1096
01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:07.220
David Schaich (he): starting in 10 min. But as you continue preparing for the exam over the next couple of weeks, you know.

1097
01:39:07.290 --> 01:39:09.480
David Schaich (he): get in touch. If any of you

1098
01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:16.580
David Schaich (he): questions or concerns you arise during that whole period. So good luck with the exam

1099
01:39:16.670 --> 01:39:18.840
David Schaich (he): and enjoy your

1100
01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:20.390
David Schaich (he): You found

1101
01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.940
David Schaich (he): knowledge of statistical physics.

1102
01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:30.900
David Schaich (he): Obviously. okay.
