00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
David Schaich (he): ...hit the

2
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.910
David Schaich (he): recording button.

3
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.480
David Schaich (he): So

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.209
David Schaich (he): welcome to statistical physics,

5
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.800
David Schaich (he):  Math327.

6
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.430
David Schaich (he): This is

7
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.729
David Schaich (he): a fun topic that I'm giving now for the second time in person, which means I should introduce myself as

8
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.769
David Schaich (he): David Schaich, lecture in theoretical physics here.

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.830
David Schaich (he): and that

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.139
David Schaich (he): a lot of my research deals with applications of statistical physics, some of which we

11
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.269
David Schaich (he): seen it maybe before getting on From that I should ask it.

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.609
David Schaich (he): All of you already know each other from

13
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.210
David Schaich (he): previous modules.

14
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:52.299
David Schaich (he): some nods, some shaking the Ted. Well, I don't know any of you, so maybe we'll just go briefly around the room. You can. Probably

15
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.190
David Schaich (he): my name is Louis and I'm from China.

16
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.640
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

17
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:14.230
David Schaich (he): Nice to meet all of you, and there will be more coming to some of these classes, probably the ones in the afternoon, but for now

18
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.789
David Schaich (he): we can

19
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.689
David Schaich (he): under way with the very first day.

20
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.690
David Schaich (he): where

21
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.429
David Schaich (he): it takes a motivation from an old saying

22
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.750
David Schaich (he): that

23
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.119
David Schaich (he): the journey of a 1,000 miles

24
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.319
David Schaich (he): begins with asking, is it worth it?

25
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.810
David Schaich (he): So, in order to motivate

26
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.329
David Schaich (he): the long journey, will be taken with statistical physics

27
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.739
David Schaich (he): in this term.

28
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.820
David Schaich (he): Just

29
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.750
David Schaich (he): review the

30
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.339
David Schaich (he): big picture we

31
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.549
David Schaich (he): central concept and some of the core results we're going after. And also say that as this is

32
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.549
David Schaich (he): the second time i'm teaching this, I'm. Bringing in feedback from last year's

33
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.159
David Schaich (he): class, and going to try to see how well I can write meeting over

34
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.890
David Schaich (he): this projector rather than up in shock on the blackboard largely for the sake of having a nice

35
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.460
David Schaich (he): screen capture to record and put online for leave a reference

36
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.240
David Schaich (he): I will check in and be 3 to see how well that is going, but that already is a bit of the

37
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.430
David Schaich (he): boarding logistical details

38
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.059
David Schaich (he): that we do. We need to touch on

39
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.869
David Schaich (he): on the first Monday of term

40
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.170
David Schaich (he): as usual.

41
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.920
David Schaich (he): and then once they.

42
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.520
David Schaich (he): I went into

43
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.210
David Schaich (he): the content of the outline

44
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.210
David Schaich (he): of the module, starting with

45
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.950
David Schaich (he): some foundations for

46
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.790
David Schaich (he): probability.

47
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.280
David Schaich (he): So that's the

48
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.459
David Schaich (he): plan for today, and I almost forgot.

49
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.809
David Schaich (he): I have a 6 digit attendance monitoring code.

50
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.660
David Schaich (he): So let's put that up here

51
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.590
David Schaich (he): 5,

52
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.100
David Schaich (he): 6, 8, 7,

53
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.769
David Schaich (he): 1 1.

54
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.580
Put that on the board as well.

55
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.649
David Schaich (he): Okay.

56
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.640
David Schaich (he): I'm gonna

57
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.470
David Schaich (he): that. We're going on

58
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.379
David Schaich (he): all of the tasks that

59
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.419
David Schaich (he): like that just need to be done

60
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.920
David Schaich (he): from day to day. So

61
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.970
David Schaich (he): right into my

62
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.170
David Schaich (he): that big picture for

63
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.350
David Schaich (he): statistical physics.

64
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.870
David Schaich (he): So just summarizing

65
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.620
David Schaich (he): what sorts of things we'll be learning about in this module.

66
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.090
David Schaich (he): and why

67
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.700
David Schaich (he): I want to

68
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.150
David Schaich (he): emphasize the point that

69
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.530
David Schaich (he): statistical physics is

70
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.689
David Schaich (he): really one of the pillars of modern physics, by which I mean sort of everything that's happened in the past

71
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.260
David Schaich (he): 100 5,200 years. In physics it goes along with

72
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.660
David Schaich (he): quantum

73
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.650
David Schaich (he): physics and also relativity.

74
00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:17.800
David Schaich (he): Yes.

75
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:19.880
David Schaich (he): the

76
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.140
David Schaich (he): 3

77
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.450
David Schaich (he): basic concepts that underly

78
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.720
David Schaich (he): essentially all of the

79
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.190
David Schaich (he): applications and

80
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.999
David Schaich (he): and work that's been done in

81
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.040
David Schaich (he): modern physics.

82
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.249
David Schaich (he): in our lifetimes and before.

83
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.830
David Schaich (he): and

84
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.410
David Schaich (he): the way in which, or what statistical physics brings into this mixture.

85
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.390
David Schaich (he): for modern physics is

86
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.170
David Schaich (he): the focus on

87
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.240
David Schaich (he): the

88
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.600
David Schaich (he): behavior, all of many

89
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.500
David Schaich (he): independent degrees of freedom.

90
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.319
David Schaich (he): The size of this

91
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.340
David Schaich (he): it's dealing with large numbers.

92
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.040
David Schaich (he): No call particles here

93
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.289
David Schaich (he): can be objects that necessarily need to be

94
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.609
David Schaich (he): atoms or elementary particles

95
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.109
David Schaich (he): any fundamental sort, but just a large collection of

96
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.729
David Schaich (he): objects that are all

97
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.090
David Schaich (he): interacting and behaving according to

98
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.749
David Schaich (he): mechanics. Quantum mechanics for classical mechanics, relativistically not relativistic.

99
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.090
David Schaich (he): But once we have

100
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.960
David Schaich (he): a large number.

101
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.769
David Schaich (he): statistical physics give us a tool to handle

102
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.780
David Schaich (he): or to analyze the behavior of large numbers of particles, and see the

103
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.370
David Schaich (he): properties or the phenomena that emerge from that behavior.

104
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.519
David Schaich (he): And before going into

105
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.340
David Schaich (he): what some of those emerging phenomena are.

106
00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.769
David Schaich (he): Maybe it's

107
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:06.340
David Schaich (he): useful to just emphasize what sort of large numbers we're going to have in mind if we think of.

108
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.760
David Schaich (he): hey?

109
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.650
David Schaich (he): So a single

110
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.380
David Schaich (he): of water

111
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.930
David Schaich (he): that has

112
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.470
David Schaich (he): roughly 10 to the power.

113
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.160
David Schaich (he): 22,

114
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.199
David Schaich (he): all the tools of H. 20.

115
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:33.030
David Schaich (he): So I got those number divided by the atomic weight of water. It's about

116
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:41.270
David Schaich (he): 6 times 10 to the 23 over 18 is 10 to the 22 min round numbers, with numbers. This large. We don't need to care

117
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.489
David Schaich (he): too much about

118
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.790
David Schaich (he): any significant figures beyond that number and the exponents.

119
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.499
David Schaich (he): And if we want to say, take our

120
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.140
David Schaich (he): mechanics

121
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.260
David Schaich (he): knowledge, and use it to describe it

122
00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.199
David Schaich (he): that many particles directly. Then we're talking about

123
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.500
David Schaich (he): roughly.

124
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.689
David Schaich (he): and the power 22

125
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.370
David Schaich (he): couple of

126
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.790
David Schaich (he): hey

127
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.960
David Schaich (he): position.

128
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.230
David Schaich (he): velocity

129
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.379
David Schaich (he): for each of those

130
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.870
David Schaich (he): h 2 or molecules. You might also care about this orientation.

131
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.179
David Schaich (he): We have a city

132
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.030
David Schaich (he): 3 times

133
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:31.599
David Schaich (he): position and velocity for each one describing a position in three-dimensional space and velocity in all 3 directions.

134
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.430
David Schaich (he): And if we even imagine running down

135
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.210
David Schaich (he): an initial state

136
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.980
David Schaich (he): for these

137
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.450
David Schaich (he): and the 22 molecules that form just the cubic centimeter of water.

138
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.670
David Schaich (he): So we give each of these positions and velocities a 32 bit number

139
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.559
David Schaich (he): in some computer storage. So that's 4 Byte.

140
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:55.940
David Schaich (he): And

141
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.169
David Schaich (he): and I think that 3 times 4 times 10 to 22

142
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.560
David Schaich (he): don't care about

143
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.150
David Schaich (he): the number upfront what we have 10 to 23

144
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:07.970
David Schaich (he): bytes

145
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.010
David Schaich (he): of information.

146
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.319
David Schaich (he): just to write down the initial State

147
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.680
David Schaich (he): even before

148
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.669
David Schaich (he): solving the

149
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.219
David Schaich (he): 10 to the 22 couple of equations that

150
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.130
David Schaich (he): describe how we all in time

151
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.849
David Schaich (he): and by the 5

152
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.980
David Schaich (he): familiar

153
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.289
David Schaich (he): you this that's

154
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.969
David Schaich (he): a 100 million

155
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.880
David Schaich (he): terabytes of data just to write down the initial state of the system.

156
00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.090
David Schaich (he): So it looks as though

157
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.650
David Schaich (he): analyzing even a small cubic centimeter. So it's a centimeter of water.

158
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.260
David Schaich (he): using the

159
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.650
David Schaich (he): traditional mechanics, tools and techniques that you've seen, and

160
00:08:50.800 --> 00:09:00.659
David Schaich (he): other physics modules is a hopeless proposition just from the start. This is where statistical physics comes in.

161
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.410
David Schaich (he): They'll give us ways to

162
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:10.199
David Schaich (he): look at the large scale behavior of collections, of large numbers of

163
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:15.509
David Schaich (he): degrees of freedom, large numbers of particles, and get predictions out of those that

164
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.150
David Schaich (he): even though they won't, be exactly solving all of these equations, they will model them based on

165
00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:27.020
David Schaich (he): randomness or stochastic assumptions.

166
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.960
David Schaich (he): You will still get excellence agreements with

167
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.780
David Schaich (he): physical observations.

168
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.220
David Schaich (he): and

169
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.470
David Schaich (he): maybe that

170
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.330
David Schaich (he): brings me back to you.

171
00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.340
David Schaich (he): It's question that I had

172
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.049
David Schaich (he): up on the projector along with the attendance code

173
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.380
David Schaich (he): which was

174
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.819
David Schaich (he): thinking about

175
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.070
David Schaich (he): how

176
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.379
David Schaich (he): scientists decided that

177
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.999
David Schaich (he): Adams actually existed, which was

178
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.139
David Schaich (he): a development so only about a little over 100 years ago.

179
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.319
David Schaich (he): back in the 18 hundreds that were

180
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.520
David Schaich (he): endless debates about

181
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:08.060
David Schaich (he): whether Adams really exist in the world, or just a convenient tool to think of

182
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.979
David Schaich (he): things about the actual physical truth. Did any of you have

183
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.210
David Schaich (he): any considerations about

184
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.500
David Schaich (he): these questions.

185
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.670
David Schaich (he): not hearing any. What I will suggest is that there are

186
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.680
David Schaich (he): a few ways to

187
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:52.000
David Schaich (he): established the existence of something before it can be observed directly whether that is

188
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.160
David Schaich (he): an H. 2, a molecule of water, or

189
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.540
David Schaich (he): fundamental strings of the plan scale.

190
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:04.289
David Schaich (he): One of those is to show that physical analyses, based on the assumption that these objects exist

191
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.850
David Schaich (he): correctly reproduce observed behavior.

192
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.979
David Schaich (he): Another is to

193
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.950
David Schaich (he): show that

194
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.329
David Schaich (he): there's no other way to

195
00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.470
Oh.

196
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.919
David Schaich (he): explaining these sorts of observable behavior.

197
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.860
David Schaich (he): So

198
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.350
David Schaich (he): that is the

199
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.780
David Schaich (he): enterprise that's

200
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:35.760
David Schaich (he): taking a little step back into history. People initially working on statistical physics in the 18 hundreds like

201
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.330
Boltzmann

202
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:46.240
David Schaich (he): names will encounter throughout the Module. They demonstrated how concepts like

203
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:52.039
David Schaich (he): pressure and entropy and thermodynamics could be explained on the basis of

204
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.639
David Schaich (he): Adams. A large number of atoms

205
00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:58.790
David Schaich (he): interacting with each other, and a real breakthrough came

206
00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:03.739
David Schaich (he): in 1905 when a fellow named Albert Einstein might have heard of

207
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.750
David Schaich (he): use those ideas of statistical physics to

208
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:15.339
David Schaich (he): explain what was called brownie and motion, something that had been observed close to 100 years before, that in the 18 twenties.

209
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.950
David Schaich (he): So scientists look at

210
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.649
David Schaich (he): Greg is a pollen

211
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:24.080
David Schaich (he): loading in water, looked at them under a microscope, which in the 18 twenties

212
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.759
David Schaich (he): was enough to see individual pollen grains.

213
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.650
David Schaich (he): Microscopes even today can't release optically see

214
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.730
David Schaich (he): as of of water. So these were brains and pollen in.

215
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.220
David Schaich (he): as far as we could tell, a continuous fluid.

216
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.380
David Schaich (he): and people observed

217
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.839
David Schaich (he): among the ground that these grades of pollen were randomly moving around

218
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.109
David Schaich (he): in this fluid.

219
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.450
David Schaich (he): and the question of why and how that was happening.

220
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.270
David Schaich (he): Well, it took about 80 years to to be resolved.

221
00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:00.770
David Schaich (he): Some of the first ideas for that maybe these grades of pollen were actually alive.

222
00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:04.570
David Schaich (he): They were little animals that were swimming around in the water

223
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.009
David Schaich (he): that was ruled out.

224
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.560
David Schaich (he): and in 1905 is

225
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.569
David Schaich (he): part of his so-called miracle.

226
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:11.580
What she

227
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:16.080
David Schaich (he): also introduce Special relativity equals Mc squared

228
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:16.940
David Schaich (he): and

229
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.949
David Schaich (he): introduced on an initial

230
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.009
David Schaich (he): progress in quantum mechanics, explaining the the photoelectric effect.

231
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.720
David Schaich (he): Einstein published a third work.

232
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.320
assuming

233
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:39.499
David Schaich (he): the existence of Adams, analyzing them through statistical physics, and predicting precisely how far these cranes of pollen or other objects would move as

234
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.429
David Schaich (he): these water molecules bounced off of them in time.

235
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.259
David Schaich (he): That was something that

236
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.129
David Schaich (he): folks were unable to explain with

237
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.359
David Schaich (he): other ways of

238
00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:01.099
David Schaich (he): modeling water as a continuous fluid, for instance, and in short order.

239
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.949
David Schaich (he): Within a couple of years they

240
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:16.029
David Schaich (he): had conducted experiments inspired by Einstein's calculations confirmed his predictions, and was newly awarded the 1926

241
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.740
David Schaich (he): Nobel prize.

242
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.580
David Schaich (he): or

243
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:26.899
David Schaich (he): demonstrating the what they call the discontinuous structure of matter. In other words, the existence of

244
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.600
David Schaich (he): based on

245
00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.110
David Schaich (he): that statistical physics analysis.

246
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.730
David Schaich (he): Whether something similar will happen for a string theory, I guess, is

247
00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.310
David Schaich (he): you have to be determined.

248
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.400
David Schaich (he): But

249
00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.339
David Schaich (he): what's that

250
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.170
David Schaich (he): sort of gravity? Motion is something that

251
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.149
David Schaich (he): might not be familiar to a lot of it. Had any of you

252
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.899
David Schaich (he): heard of that before

253
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:51.449
David Schaich (he): coming in here today.

254
00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.580
David Schaich (he): and

255
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.180
David Schaich (he): a level

256
00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.629
David Schaich (he): it. It is

257
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.979
David Schaich (he): a nice historical topic to to look at

258
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.960
something maybe more familiar in the everyday

259
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:04.970
which

260
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.799
David Schaich (he): i'll have to zoom out to

261
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.470
David Schaich (he): on to this projector is

262
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.150
David Schaich (he): what we can call with

263
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.850
David Schaich (he): some poetry the arrow of time.

264
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.440
David Schaich (he): the idea that

265
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.370
David Schaich (he): we can tell, looking at certain processes

266
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:29.820
David Schaich (he): which direction time is flowing. Which of these 4 snapshots of a beaker of water. It comes before or after the others.

267
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:30.960
David Schaich (he): so

268
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.060
David Schaich (he): in that

269
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:33.790
David Schaich (he): this

270
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:41.169
David Schaich (he): low budget animation a drop with purple dye is being dropped into a beaker of water.

271
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:47.749
David Schaich (he): and as it comes in it diffuses, spreads out. It eventually fills that whole beaker.

272
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:52.629
David Schaich (he): and we intuitively know that

273
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.410
David Schaich (he): time is

274
00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.220
David Schaich (he): going from

275
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.560
David Schaich (he): left to right

276
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.570
David Schaich (he): in these 4 frames.

277
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.420
David Schaich (he): The arrow is pointing in

278
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.679
David Schaich (he): that direction, even though

279
00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.340
David Schaich (he): do you

280
00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:17.250
David Schaich (he): underlying processes? If you look at the individual atoms of dye and water, how they're bouncing off

281
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:19.940
David Schaich (he): dying water, how they're bouncing off each other!

282
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:24.439
David Schaich (he): All of those interactions are symmetric under the reversible time.

283
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.290
David Schaich (he): 2 molecules come in and dance off each other.

284
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.429
David Schaich (he): It's entirely possible for the switch. Directions come back in and out the other way

285
00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.500
David Schaich (he): so

286
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.980
David Schaich (he): totally

287
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.640
David Schaich (he): it is

288
00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.140
David Schaich (he): entirely possible for, say.

289
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.160
David Schaich (he): a spread out to bounce off

290
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:52.639
David Schaich (he): the tend to be 24 or so water molecules in here in such a way that, as time goes on

291
00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.850
David Schaich (he): spontaneously close to a smaller drop.

292
00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.170
David Schaich (he): and eventually

293
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.059
David Schaich (he): could even be injected if the

294
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.270
David Schaich (he): enough of these water molecules

295
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.670
David Schaich (he): along with it in the proper way.

296
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.839
David Schaich (he): But we know that would be crazy.

297
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.620
David Schaich (he): And given

298
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:17.189
David Schaich (he): this this picture, we can tell what way time is flowing. If we were to be given

299
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.740
David Schaich (he): the sequence of this animation

300
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:25.239
David Schaich (he): running in reverse, it would be obvious that it was going in reverse, just from

301
00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:26.410
the

302
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:27.900
David Schaich (he): behavior of

303
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.530
David Schaich (he): the large scale diffusion coming from the underlying dynamics of

304
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:33.420
these

305
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.499
David Schaich (he): hundreds of billions of dollars.

306
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.280
David Schaich (he): So

307
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.910
David Schaich (he): that is.

308
00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.150
David Schaich (he): we talked about that

309
00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.510
David Schaich (he): some of the

310
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.120
David Schaich (he): historical

311
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.260
David Schaich (he): uses of statistical physics to demonstrate that at least

312
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.600
David Schaich (he): and explain.

313
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.290
David Schaich (he): I will explain that. Just tell me now this is

314
00:17:55.450 --> 00:18:03.690
David Schaich (he): a target and a possibility for what we're going to do, how this area of time arises, and how we can understand it scientifically.

315
00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:08.470
David Schaich (he): But statistical physics is not just

316
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.459
David Schaich (he): domain of a 100 years ago

317
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.830
David Schaich (he): that you.

318
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:18.550
David Schaich (he): Nobel Prize in physics from not this past autumn, but 2021

319
00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.479
David Schaich (he): was given to these 3 folks.

320
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.600
David Schaich (he): I can practice mispronouncing names.

321
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.060
David Schaich (he): secure

322
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:31.170
David Schaich (he): or

323
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.670
David Schaich (he): modern day applications of statistical physics

324
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.329
David Schaich (he): and hustleman our climate scientists.

325
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.110
David Schaich (he): and we can imagine that looking at

326
00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.740
David Schaich (he): the client, that's all with you.

327
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.390
David Schaich (he): Adams, out there, how they're all interacting in many different forms to drive

328
00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.729
David Schaich (he): weather and warming currents, and

329
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:53.890
David Schaich (he): everything else

330
00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:55.960
David Schaich (he): going on in the environment

331
00:18:56.090 --> 00:19:04.449
David Schaich (he): lies on statistical physics techniques to handle such a large number of particles interacting in such a large number of ways.

332
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.510
David Schaich (he): no, at least the

333
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.890
David Schaich (he): effects of particles being introduced into the system by human activity.

334
00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.060
Georgia or Easy.

335
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.970
David Schaich (he): His work is even more directly related to statistical physics. If you

336
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.340
David Schaich (he): look it up, that's the domain it will be under

337
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.340
David Schaich (he): here

338
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.279
David Schaich (he): introduced and analyzed.

339
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.109
David Schaich (he): So the theoretical concepts and systems known as spin glasses.

340
00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:35.380
David Schaich (he): something that we may well have a chance at least to look at.

341
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:36.110
And

342
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.120
David Schaich (he): the later stages of this course.

343
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:48.590
David Schaich (he): systems of spins, little magnets that interact with each other in a disordered way that have

344
00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.470
David Schaich (he): unique and

345
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:55.339
David Schaich (he): predictable phenomena that we're able to find applications.

346
00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.699
David Schaich (he): I say, in the nobel

347
00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:04.750
David Schaich (he): citation applications from atomic scales to planetary scales.

348
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.810
David Schaich (he): all based on the interactions of these large numbers of particles.

349
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:14.919
David Schaich (he): So we might see the spin glasses. I'm permitting we're not going to

350
00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.339
David Schaich (he): do Nobel, where they work, analyzing them.

351
00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.879
David Schaich (he): Some things that we are going to be able to do.

352
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.799
David Schaich (he): I say, look at the

353
00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:25.800
David Schaich (he): keep capacity

354
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.459
David Schaich (he): of various materials?

355
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.650
Or

356
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.999
David Schaich (he): is the heat capacity of a material in general, we will

357
00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:34.709
David Schaich (he): first of all just call me

358
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.709
David Schaich (he): what a heat capacity is

359
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.360
David Schaich (he): related to

360
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.870
David Schaich (he): how much energy

361
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.280
David Schaich (he): is involved in

362
00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.420
David Schaich (he): a unit of temperature

363
00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.629
David Schaich (he): in a specific way that will be made precise.

364
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:51.410
David Schaich (he): And the

365
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:59.400
David Schaich (he): points on this plot our measurements of this heat capacity for a few different materials led aluminium and diamond.

366
00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:04.250
David Schaich (he): As a function of the temperature. Roughly, room temperature is 300 kelvin

367
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.799
David Schaich (he): plus, or minus 100 in other direction.

368
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:11.290
David Schaich (he): and the lines on here are predictions for how this

369
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:16.109
David Schaich (he): measurable quantity in these levels should behave as

370
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:21.089
David Schaich (he): a function of temperature, and that is a prediction that you will be able to derive.

371
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.479
David Schaich (he): We will also be able to

372
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:29.230
David Schaich (he): zoom in on at low temperature region, and I think so

373
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.009
David Schaich (he): here for a few different materials.

374
00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.900
David Schaich (he): copper, silver, and gold, or

375
00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.459
David Schaich (he): we'll be able to derive

376
00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:44.299
David Schaich (he): the precise form of the seed capacity

377
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.540
David Schaich (he): as

378
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.220
David Schaich (he): a linear piece, so

379
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.759
David Schaich (he): it's on the vertical axis. Now is the heat capacity divided by temperature

380
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:58.610
David Schaich (he): so multiply by temperature on either side that concept intercept

381
00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:59.860
David Schaich (he): becomes

382
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.500
David Schaich (he): a linear piece

383
00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.300
David Schaich (he): in the

384
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.019
David Schaich (he): independence of the E capacity plus a straight line

385
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:13.280
David Schaich (he): on the plot versus T squared gives the next correction of t cubed.

386
00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:17.619
David Schaich (he): Here we can see we're looking at very low temperatures about

387
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:26.030
David Schaich (he): 3 or 4 degrees below, or sorry about absolute 0, well below 0. So on the cell some scale.

388
00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.439
David Schaich (he): and we will

389
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:33.429
David Schaich (he): derive that low temperature behavior. Only see capacity which is

390
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.029
David Schaich (he): at a fundamental level coming from

391
00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.930
David Schaich (he): the behavior of the electrons in these metals.

392
00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.260
David Schaich (he): created as

393
00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.610
David Schaich (he): a

394
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.350
David Schaich (he): it gets

395
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:46.680
David Schaich (he): all particles.

396
00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.129
David Schaich (he): maybe the one last

397
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.939
David Schaich (he): forecast, if something we can look forward to is

398
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:54.840
David Schaich (he): this

399
00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.570
David Schaich (he): so here, which is

400
00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.840
David Schaich (he): now fitting on the screen.

401
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:01.890
David Schaich (he): which is

402
00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.029
David Schaich (he): a measurement of what's called the power spectrum

403
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.600
David Schaich (he): of the

404
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.950
David Schaich (he): cosmic microwave background.

405
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:10.879
David Schaich (he): So you

406
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.260
David Schaich (he): lingering

407
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:20.189
David Schaich (he): radiation that remains following the the Big Bang of 13 points

408
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.380
David Schaich (he): 7 or so 1 billionyears ago.

409
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.320
David Schaich (he): The you

410
00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.610
here. This power spectrum is

411
00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:33.799
David Schaich (he): a powers. You can see this energy Times time divided by a volume.

412
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.750
David Schaich (he): So an energy density

413
00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.749
David Schaich (he): Times time

414
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:41.839
David Schaich (he): plotted against the frequency. You know, units of hairs.

415
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:48.450
David Schaich (he): Don't need to worry about the precise details between we'll get to in due course.

416
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:49.979
David Schaich (he): Just to say that

417
00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.599
David Schaich (he): this measurements of that

418
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.299
David Schaich (he): cosmic microwave background

419
00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:58.090
David Schaich (he): power, that from the amount of power in the

420
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.489
David Schaich (he): radiation up in the frequency

421
00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:10.139
David Schaich (he): was carried out by this Kobe mission. So that was a satellite in the 1990 S. The cosmic background explorer, and this plot

422
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.140
David Schaich (he): itself

423
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:12.050
one.

424
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.629
David Schaich (he): I should say it will work that went into it.

425
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.599
David Schaich (he): It's also recognized by a relatively recent Nobel prize, at least recent enough that all of us

426
00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.519
David Schaich (he): hopefully we're alive at that point in 2,006.

427
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.159
David Schaich (he): So that is

428
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.880
David Schaich (he): hopefully demonstrating

429
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.310
David Schaich (he): the

430
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.680
David Schaich (he): why are they.

431
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.590
David Schaich (he): and also power of

432
00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.660
David Schaich (he): statistical physics applications

433
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.620
David Schaich (he): With a little preview

434
00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.319
David Schaich (he): of some of the things we will be going for.

435
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.489
David Schaich (he): So let me

436
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.090
David Schaich (he): turn to

437
00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.120
David Schaich (he): topic some questions that may seem

438
00:24:52.770 --> 00:25:00.230
David Schaich (he): abstract or later. Today, in the next few weeks we can keep in mind the source of targets we're going after.

439
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:01.870
David Schaich (he): And

440
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.300
David Schaich (he): with all of that hopefully motivating this work

441
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.700
David Schaich (he): might as well

442
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:09.609
David Schaich (he): I don't know

443
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.230
David Schaich (he): not so much about what we'll learn, but

444
00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:13.930
David Schaich (he): more about

445
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.729
David Schaich (he): how we're going to go about this.

446
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:17.680
David Schaich (he): So

447
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.640
David Schaich (he): just take it

448
00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.129
David Schaich (he): quick glance through

449
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.420
David Schaich (he): the logistics

450
00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:29.089
David Schaich (he): and the canvas page for the module which

451
00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:34.509
David Schaich (he): you hopefully have been able to reach. And hopefully, it looks like this.

452
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.029
David Schaich (he): We are now in room 106

453
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.849
David Schaich (he): at 9 am. On the Monday.

454
00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:43.540
David Schaich (he): and in their wisdom the people who schedule

455
00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.529
David Schaich (he): the meeting times have put us in in different rooms

456
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.129
David Schaich (he): on every day of the week, just to keep us on our toes. So

457
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:58.109
David Schaich (he): the lecture tomorrow afternoon we'll be next door in the bigger room. That currently has a bigger class right now

458
00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:03.330
David Schaich (he): and then tutorials on Thursday mornings, upstairs in room to 10.

459
00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.269
David Schaich (he): Please ask questions.

460
00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:10.140
David Schaich (he): Yeah. The space should be accessible.

461
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.870
David Schaich (he): You should have gotten an announcement from me

462
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.620
David Schaich (he): last week a a link to it.

463
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.320
David Schaich (he): that link. So it's. Course

464
00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:24.469
David Schaich (he): 6 0, 6, 0, one up at the top. If you have any trouble getting to it.

465
00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.930
David Schaich (he): come and talk to me, and we'll sort that out.

466
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.160
David Schaich (he): and

467
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.670
David Schaich (he): I will say

468
00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:43.709
David Schaich (he): in terms of coming to talk to me office hours just to keep things simple are the hour after every class meeting, so Mondays and Thursdays at 11 Tuesdays at 5, and that will be

469
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:48.850
David Schaich (he): in my office, which is the theoretical physics wing. It's that wipes up

470
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.439
David Schaich (he): wing you can see over there facing the build of students.

471
00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.400
David Schaich (he): Let me know if you don't know how to get there, because

472
00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.880
David Schaich (he): it's a bit of an adventure you haven't been.

473
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.090
David Schaich (he): and I I will also

474
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.050
David Schaich (he): try to keep a Zoom Meeting running

475
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:15.000
David Schaich (he): during those office hours which i'm also using right now to record this. And we found that Zoom produces much better recordings than

476
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:20.479
David Schaich (he): the lecture capture software that the University has come up with on its own.

477
00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.970
David Schaich (he): One other complication is that

478
00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:26.940
David Schaich (he): starting next week and running

479
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.530
David Schaich (he): for the 3 weeks

480
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.399
David Schaich (he): and start that fill most of February.

481
00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:36.799
David Schaich (he): the schedule will be slightly different. We will still be in here Monday mornings.

482
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:39.620
David Schaich (he): But then, on Tuesday afternoon at one.

483
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.130
David Schaich (he): you will have meetings in the

484
00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.500
David Schaich (he): computer line up down the hall

485
00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.940
David Schaich (he): on this more of the building.

486
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:53.810
David Schaich (he): and what those meetings are designed to do is give you an opportunity to work on

487
00:27:54.370 --> 00:28:02.019
David Schaich (he): one of the 3 interim assignments for the module, which will be a computer project do

488
00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:04.479
David Schaich (he): in

489
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:09.709
David Schaich (he): little over 3 weeks toward the end of February, and

490
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:17.639
David Schaich (he): it's not yet online. It should show up in a day or 2. I'm. Just checking to make sure that all of the

491
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.019
David Schaich (he): tasks that are assigned that project are actually feasible.

492
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.760
David Schaich (he): and probably on

493
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:30.230
David Schaich (he): this Thursday, and that first tutorial that can take a look at some of the

494
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:42.879
David Schaich (he): computing that we'll be doing for this. I will say that no background in computing is assumed or expected. And that's part of the reason we have those computer labs to give you

495
00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.950
David Schaich (he): practice and an opportunity to

496
00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:45.930
David Schaich (he): see what

497
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.880
David Schaich (he): learn what you need to

498
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:52.099
David Schaich (he): with me close to hand. If any issues come up.

499
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:59.539
David Schaich (he): it is something that you should be able to finish in those 6 h of computer lab.

500
00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:02.190
David Schaich (he): So

501
00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:05.590
David Schaich (he): yeah.

502
00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.239
David Schaich (he): there is no need to wait for the lab.

503
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:09.930
David Schaich (he): Those of you who

504
00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:15.909
David Schaich (he): are already expert programmers may even find it might not even take you one of those 3 meetings.

505
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:19.680
David Schaich (he): But there's going to be a spread of acceptable

506
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.949
David Schaich (he): amounts of time that it will take.

507
00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:23.560
David Schaich (he): based on

508
00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:30.360
David Schaich (he): how much experience you have with programming, and how naturally it it comes to you. That's something that

509
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:34.010
David Schaich (he): varies based on everyone's, background and and past experience.

510
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.089
David Schaich (he): and there's a wide range of

511
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:40.049
David Schaich (he): acceptable amount of time it will take to to deal with that.

512
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:41.689
David Schaich (he): So hopefully.

513
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:46.279
David Schaich (he): those 3 computer labs and those 3 weeks leading to

514
00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:47.310
David Schaich (he): that's

515
00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:48.800
David Schaich (he): good line

516
00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.720
David Schaich (he): will be plenty for everyone.

517
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.990
David Schaich (he): I will say that

518
00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:57.380
David Schaich (he): I did request different deadlines, and then these.

519
00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.180
David Schaich (he): But wasn't able to get them just based on

520
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:10.680
David Schaich (he): balancing things with all the other modules everyone else wanted. They have a class test in week. 7 say so. Our homework got kicked up 2 week, 5 just

521
00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:15.400
David Schaich (he): do one week after the into that computer project. So

522
00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:23.700
David Schaich (he): I will say, that's this twenty-first of February is that third and final day that we will meet in room 101

523
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:25.520
David Schaich (he): for the computer lab.

524
00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:33.210
David Schaich (he): So, hopefully by that point the project will be nearly done for everyone, and it can get in by the end of the day.

525
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:36.579
David Schaich (he): Homework itself is then

526
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.519
David Schaich (he): do the following week. It will also be

527
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.600
David Schaich (he): released

528
00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:41.740
David Schaich (he): soon that

529
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:43.409
David Schaich (he): okay, once I check that.

530
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.240
David Schaich (he): But here I have to check that. It's going to cover stuff that we'll get through it

531
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:48.530
David Schaich (he): by that time.

532
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:53.430
David Schaich (he): and then the second homework is not due until after the spring break.

533
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.810
David Schaich (he): March and April are going to be

534
00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:57.209
David Schaich (he): sort of

535
00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:59.300
David Schaich (he): relatively light

536
00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.090
David Schaich (he): months for this module, at least in terms of

537
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.849
David Schaich (he): assessment. So each of these 3 projects

538
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:10.359
David Schaich (he): and see our 15% to the overall mark. The remaining 55 is

539
00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.810
David Schaich (he): a 2 h.

540
00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:17.139
David Schaich (he): a final exam which will be scheduled in the usual way

541
00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:19.949
David Schaich (he): that's in person, as

542
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.610
David Schaich (he): I think we're back to that

543
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.060
David Schaich (he): pattern in general now.

544
00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:31.689
David Schaich (he): So I head back to

545
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.530
David Schaich (he): the landing page for

546
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.370
David Schaich (he): the site, and see if there is anything else

547
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:37.950
David Schaich (he): with highlighting

548
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.879
David Schaich (he): it's on this page which you should be able to reach on your own.

549
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.210
David Schaich (he): Hi, man.

550
00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:50.140
David Schaich (he): we'll say that the overall outline for the course that we can see both there and

551
00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:54.970
David Schaich (he): in the the modules page, which is where the recordings and

552
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.229
David Schaich (he): written notes are going to be uploaded

553
00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:01.450
David Schaich (he): and see that there are

554
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:13.699
David Schaich (he): 10 units to get through in the 12 weeks of the term. So it's not going to be a one unit per week type of thing. Some of these units are going to take longer than others. Some are going to be quicker.

555
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:22.999
David Schaich (he): and I can also say much like the computer programming. There is not a prerequisite to have seen anything about quantum mechanics. When we

556
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.270
David Schaich (he): go to.

557
00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.480
David Schaich (he): I say these units on process statistics and quantum gases

558
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:33.080
David Schaich (he): that produce the heat capacity for metals, and those temperatures.

559
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.830
David Schaich (he): All of the quantumist

560
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:44.310
David Schaich (he): of what we'll be looking at is just going to be introduced as an here in this module.

561
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:48.909
David Schaich (he): and you don't need to worry if you haven't seen any of that before.

562
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:53.970
David Schaich (he): There is a python programming demo link here that

563
00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:55.530
David Schaich (he): we'll look at

564
00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.260
David Schaich (he): Thursday's tutorial or the

565
00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:01.900
David Schaich (he): computer labs, and also some of the

566
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.550
David Schaich (he): lecture notes that, at least for me

567
00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.680
David Schaich (he): plan for each of the lectures

568
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.170
David Schaich (he): we're going through.

569
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.220
David Schaich (he): along with some additional

570
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.809
David Schaich (he): logistical information and the usual statements about

571
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:18.920
David Schaich (he): academic integrity and

572
00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:21.000
David Schaich (he): additional

573
00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:22.820
David Schaich (he): resources.

574
00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.299
David Schaich (he): Various textbooks that

575
00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.439
David Schaich (he): can provide more information about

576
00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:29.980
David Schaich (he): all of the

577
00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.919
David Schaich (he): topics will be going over.

578
00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:35.170
David Schaich (he): as well as

579
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.009
David Schaich (he): the advice that is probably familiar

580
00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:43.569
David Schaich (he): at this point in your third year about ways to get the most out of the module.

581
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.380
David Schaich (he): even though

582
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.139
David Schaich (he): these modules are designed to be

583
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.800
David Schaich (he): predominantly self study it's still worthwhile to

584
00:33:52.840 --> 00:34:01.729
David Schaich (he): come to class. It gives you a chance, if nothing else, to check in with the material and make sure it doesn't fall by the way side. You can ask any questions which is.

585
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:09.409
David Schaich (he): are the purpose of doing this at the University rather than just buying one of those textbooks and reading through it, and

586
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.430
David Schaich (he): it's worthwhile to

587
00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:16.069
David Schaich (he): go through the lecture that was taking a quick look before class to see what's coming.

588
00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.250
David Schaich (he): and then a more detailed look afterwards to make sure that

589
00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.500
David Schaich (he): everything in there is

590
00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.830
David Schaich (he): comfortable and familiar.

591
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:25.839
David Schaich (he): and in particular

592
00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.290
David Schaich (he): i'll mention that

593
00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:37.430
David Schaich (he): as we go through into the Content, these lecture notes are going to have gaps which are little exercises for you to fill. They will all be filled

594
00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.319
David Schaich (he): in the lectures on the that, or skips explicitly.

595
00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.609
but it's worth to

596
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:49.280
David Schaich (he): worthwhile to take a look and make sure you can fill out all of those along with. Of course.

597
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:56.219
David Schaich (he): working on the homework Problems computer project and the activities will be doing and the tutorial once we get to

598
00:34:56.310 --> 00:35:00.889
David Schaich (he): that tutorial, and of course I encourage you to ask questions.

599
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:06.650
David Schaich (he): even if you think everyone else knows the answer to them. If you don't they're worth asking.

600
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.129
David Schaich (he): And

601
00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:12.820
David Schaich (he): yeah, you can ask me. You can ask each other. You can ask those additional resources.

602
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:15.100
David Schaich (he): One thing to note is that

603
00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.329
David Schaich (he): while you're

604
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:20.139
David Schaich (he): welcome and encouraged to discuss

605
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:27.820
David Schaich (he): the homework and computer project and all the other material with each other. What you submit for assessment does need to be your own work. That

606
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.599
David Schaich (he): honestly represents your understanding

607
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:32.770
David Schaich (he): of

608
00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:34.450
David Schaich (he): the material.

609
00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.260
David Schaich (he): The one last thing i'll say about logistics

610
00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:41.169
David Schaich (he): is that

611
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.039
David Schaich (he): there is a discussion more here where I just put into place

612
00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.029
David Schaich (he): some placeholders for

613
00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.570
David Schaich (he): questions, answers, and other discussions about

614
00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.349
David Schaich (he): the various assessments

615
00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.779
David Schaich (he): you that somebody

616
00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:55.730
David Schaich (he): in the module as well as introductions.

617
00:35:55.910 --> 00:36:03.559
David Schaich (he): if those of you who might be listening to this recording rather than being here in person, wants to introduce yourself

618
00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.350
David Schaich (he): or those of you here want to

619
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:11.030
David Schaich (he): address the additional question

620
00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:12.220
David Schaich (he): of

621
00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.939
David Schaich (he): what

622
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.930
David Schaich (he): you might be interested to learn about through this module.

623
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.869
David Schaich (he): That Discussion Board is available for you.

624
00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.069
David Schaich (he): 24 7 to

625
00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:34.789
David Schaich (he): ask questions or answer These I've got ahead of. Introduce myself there, probably in more detail than we need

626
00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:36.740
David Schaich (he): that that should

627
00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.450
David Schaich (he): get us

628
00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:42.259
David Schaich (he): back to the point where we're ready to get under way

629
00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:44.169
David Schaich (he): with the material. Are there

630
00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.780
David Schaich (he): questions before we do so about

631
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.700
David Schaich (he): big picture motivation, or those logistical details

632
00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.560
David Schaich (he): that

633
00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.719
David Schaich (he): we skim through on the canvas site.

634
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.340
David Schaich (he): I should say further questions, because a couple of good ones came up along the way.

635
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:05.890
David Schaich (he): and

636
00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.060
David Schaich (he): I will.

637
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:10.830
David Schaich (he): without further ado.

638
00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:13.030
David Schaich (he): dive right into

639
00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:15.169
David Schaich (he): material that we have

640
00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.009
David Schaich (he): starting off with

641
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.979
David Schaich (he): some foundations

642
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.919
David Schaich (he): more probability.

643
00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:23.890
David Schaich (he): So

644
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.490
David Schaich (he): in the big picture we talked about some of large scale

645
00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.339
David Schaich (he): that will arise from

646
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:39.139
David Schaich (he): analyzing systems of large numbers of particles

647
00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:45.599
David Schaich (he): based on stochastic apply probability and randomness.

648
00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.120
David Schaich (he): So

649
00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:57.829
David Schaich (he): 2 of the key results of probability theory that lead to the emergence of

650
00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:02.990
David Schaich (he): smooth, continuous looking, large scale and macroscopic behavior

651
00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.710
David Schaich (he): from the somewhat chaotic and random.

652
00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.030
David Schaich (he): Apparently random dynamics of underlying

653
00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:12.779
David Schaich (he): degrees of free one, are known as the

654
00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:15.600
David Schaich (he): one of our numbers

655
00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.210
David Schaich (he): in the central limits.

656
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.700
David Schaich (he): 0

657
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:29.470
David Schaich (he): and I'm. Assuming that you will have seen

658
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.579
David Schaich (he): both of these before, possibly more than once.

659
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:41.510
David Schaich (he): and we'll go through, not fully, rigorously, and not very carefully, and review

660
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.529
David Schaich (he): how these

661
00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:46.430
David Schaich (he): probability 3 results arise

662
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.600
David Schaich (he): and sort of cast names in

663
00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.610
David Schaich (he): the the way that we're going to be using them.

664
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.509
David Schaich (he): or more detailed applications to things like

665
00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:58.599
David Schaich (he): classical quantum gases

666
00:38:59.160 --> 00:38:59.920
David Schaich (he): and

667
00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.139
David Schaich (he): other statistical systems.

668
00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.920
David Schaich (he): So to begin with some

669
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:07.330
David Schaich (he): definitions.

670
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:10.630
David Schaich (he): what's going to be underlying?

671
00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:16.979
David Schaich (he): Essentially everything we think about in this module is a concept of

672
00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:20.330
David Schaich (he): a random experiment you can call E,

673
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.879
which

674
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.020
David Schaich (he): is

675
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:29.369
David Schaich (he): essentially doing something in the world, or observing something that is happening in the world.

676
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:37.980
David Schaich (he): and upon carrying out this action or experiments.

677
00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.380
David Schaich (he): and observing

678
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.609
David Schaich (he): how the the world

679
00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:43.560
all right.

680
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.899
David Schaich (he): reacts what stated ends up in, while we

681
00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:50.740
David Schaich (he): observe the world to be

682
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:54.110
David Schaich (he): in some particular state

683
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.390
David Schaich (he): in Omega.

684
00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:58.529
which

685
00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:01.320
David Schaich (he): looks like the at the lower case.

686
00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.289
David Schaich (he): Latin letter W.

687
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:12.780
David Schaich (he): And can we just use by that well enough. The particular symbols being used are so important. But if we

688
00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:14.149
okay.

689
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:16.600
David Schaich (he): think about, just zoom.

690
00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:24.249
David Schaich (he): go along with the simplest possible example, as we define these abstract concepts and experiment could be flipping a coin.

691
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:26.439
David Schaich (he): And then the States

692
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.020
David Schaich (he): let me get out of that.

693
00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.840
David Schaich (he): We'll have information.

694
00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.229
David Schaich (he): for instance about whether that

695
00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:36.689
David Schaich (he): coin lands, heads, or tails, but it also has

696
00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:41.339
David Schaich (he): by possibly additional information about the state of the world.

697
00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.689
David Schaich (he): After

698
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:47.630
David Schaich (he): that, experiments, so, for instance.

699
00:40:47.710 --> 00:41:03.880
David Schaich (he): grew up in the air as it was being flipped. How many times it rotated! We're exactly at landed, but desk we're on the floor, and what a direction it was pointing. I meant to bring a coin to carry out that experiment, but I didn't so it will have to remain just a thought experiments.

700
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:04.859
David Schaich (he): For now.

701
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:08.490
David Schaich (he): so

702
00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.920
David Schaich (he): given some experiments that can produce

703
00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.060
David Schaich (he): as many as possible states.

704
00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.679
David Schaich (he): we can define

705
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.880
David Schaich (he): over all, sets the capital Omega

706
00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:20.750
David Schaich (he): to be

707
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.799
David Schaich (he): the set of all possible states.

708
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.529
David Schaich (he): Matt.

709
00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:29.960
David Schaich (he): This experiments

710
00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:30.890
David Schaich (he): e.

711
00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:33.060
David Schaich (he): And we produce.

712
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:40.949
David Schaich (he): So this is all the possible ways that a coin can be flipped. For instance.

713
00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:42.850
David Schaich (he): so very large sets

714
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.850
David Schaich (he): of

715
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:54.999
David Schaich (he): states, each of which can contain a very large amount of detail, most of which we are not going to care about for the purposes of statistical physics

716
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.689
David Schaich (he): with flipping a coin.

717
00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:08.640
David Schaich (he): Usually, even when we say we flip the calling it's implicit that we only care doesn't land heads up or tails up. We don't care how long it was in the air where exactly it landed, or

718
00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.010
David Schaich (he): how old the coin itself was.

719
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:21.699
David Schaich (he): So there is some interesting information in the state of the world that we want to extract, and some irrelevant information that we want to sweep aside in order to be able to analyze

720
00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.359
David Schaich (he): resources, experiments mathematically.

721
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:26.410
David Schaich (he): and

722
00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:29.860
David Schaich (he): the way that

723
00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:33.029
David Schaich (he): we extract the mathematical information

724
00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.809
David Schaich (he): it's like throwing out a measurements

725
00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:40.189
David Schaich (he): we'll call it Capital X. That

726
00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:41.379
David Schaich (he): is

727
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:45.830
David Schaich (he): a map taking in the overall state of the world

728
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.549
David Schaich (he): and extracting

729
00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:50.189
David Schaich (he): just

730
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.250
David Schaich (he): do you

731
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:53.270
David Schaich (he): information of interest.

732
00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:56.419
David Schaich (he): So

733
00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.109
David Schaich (he): in that point example.

734
00:42:58.570 --> 00:42:59.310
David Schaich (he): yeah.

735
00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:02.099
David Schaich (he): land heads up, or did it land heels up.

736
00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.099
David Schaich (he): And if we

737
00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.450
David Schaich (he): then repeat

738
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.029
David Schaich (he): that experiments

739
00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:09.700
David Schaich (he): many times.

740
00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:15.130
David Schaich (he): because it's a an experiment that evolves some elements of randomness.

741
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:22.159
David Schaich (he): whether this is random in principle, coming from quantum mechanics or random in practice.

742
00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:26.430
David Schaich (he): coming from the idea that even though we could, if we flip a coin.

743
00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:28.770
David Schaich (he): carry out the computations of

744
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:32.700
David Schaich (he): end of the 22 interactions with air molecules that determine

745
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:34.390
David Schaich (he): precisely what

746
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:38.929
David Schaich (he): how it's going to land where and when we can't do that in practice

747
00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.850
David Schaich (he): is

748
00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:44.109
David Schaich (he): the shorthand a way of simplifying

749
00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.030
David Schaich (he): the description of the experiments.

750
00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:47.740
David Schaich (he): Each time we repeat

751
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:49.200
David Schaich (he): the experiments

752
00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.640
David Schaich (he): and carry out this measurements we will get a

753
00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.850
David Schaich (he): random

754
00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:55.970
David Schaich (he): results.

755
00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.279
David Schaich (he): So

756
00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.630
David Schaich (he): this X.

757
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:03.240
David Schaich (he): The outcome of the experiment

758
00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.679
David Schaich (he): is going to

759
00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:07.839
David Schaich (he): behave as a random, variable.

760
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.350
David Schaich (he): adopting different possible

761
00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:15.820
David Schaich (he): measurement outcomes with some probabilities which

762
00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:20.150
David Schaich (he): well, we still need to define formally, but that is

763
00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:25.119
David Schaich (he): the the target here. What does probability mean it mathematically?

764
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.890
David Schaich (he): Now, if we were to

765
00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.080
David Schaich (he): measure

766
00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:35.610
David Schaich (he): all of the States

767
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:41.760
David Schaich (he): in that set of all states. Capital Omega.

768
00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:43.439
David Schaich (he): Then

769
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:47.610
David Schaich (he): this measurement will pick up all possible outcomes.

770
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.410
David Schaich (he): That's

771
00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.249
David Schaich (he): the world can't take

772
00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:57.509
David Schaich (he): discarding the the relevant information that we don't care about.

773
00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.700
David Schaich (he): So we will say that

774
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:03.919
David Schaich (he): maps at all states

775
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:07.180
David Schaich (he): to a set of all outcomes for

776
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.089
David Schaich (he): the outcome space.

777
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.930
David Schaich (he): Yeah, we will call

778
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:14.720
David Schaich (he): it's the capital a

779
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:17.319
David Schaich (he): and the

780
00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:19.310
hmm

781
00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:27.439
David Schaich (he): just a finite set of outcomes, like if we flip the coin measure has your tails. Well, those are the possible outcomes. So a is just

782
00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:29.020
David Schaich (he): heads or tails

783
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:31.830
David Schaich (he): it's possible for.

784
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.859
David Schaich (he): and help from space to be

785
00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.129
David Schaich (he): countably infinite.

786
00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:37.890
David Schaich (he): So it

787
00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:43.019
David Schaich (he): i'll see you examples of all of these shortly.

788
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.789
David Schaich (he): You can also have

789
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.389
David Schaich (he): and outcome space. That is.

790
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:51.229
David Schaich (he): I'm. Countably

791
00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:55.100
David Schaich (he): continuous.

792
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:56.520
David Schaich (he): So as a

793
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:58.379
David Schaich (he): sort of

794
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:10.749
David Schaich (he): it's an easy example of these definitions just to anchor them, something familiar.

795
00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:15.570
David Schaich (he): We'll talk about, say, ruling

796
00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.379
David Schaich (he): 6 sided down.

797
00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:22.350
David Schaich (he): And

798
00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:25.869
David Schaich (he): so that is our experiment is role to die.

799
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.839
David Schaich (he): You will measure.

800
00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:30.720
David Schaich (he): do you

801
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.530
David Schaich (he): number that comes out on top.

802
00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.569
David Schaich (he): That is

803
00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:37.939
David Schaich (he): the measurement that goes along with that experiment.

804
00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.830
David Schaich (he): So

805
00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.069
David Schaich (he): what

806
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:49.760
David Schaich (he): I can ask you is the outcome space for rolling a dye and measuring

807
00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.179
David Schaich (he): the number on top.

808
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:54.480
David Schaich (he): I mean that guy has 6 sides.

809
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.140
David Schaich (he): I'm. The standard

810
00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.200
David Schaich (he): way.

811
00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:21.310
David Schaich (he): Looks like some of you are already running down the answer.

812
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:24.009
David Schaich (he): So go ahead and and shout it out.

813
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:41.890
David Schaich (he): So the outcomes are.

814
00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:51.880
David Schaich (he): I think you're actually going ahead and talking about the probability of each of those outcomes occurring

815
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:53.089
David Schaich (he): and

816
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:57.059
David Schaich (he): each outcome itself. We're actually looking for something simpler.

817
00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.500
David Schaich (he): exactly.

818
00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.589
David Schaich (he): and we will get to the corresponding probabilities

819
00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:14.669
David Schaich (he): actually after the break. So that is the set of all outcomes. If we roll it to a dive, 6 side and dial, measure the number on top. Those numbers are one through 6,

820
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:15.640
David Schaich (he): and

821
00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:22.859
David Schaich (he): if we measure every possible state of the world of the universe that we have after rolling a dive.

822
00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:27.620
David Schaich (he): And those are the 6 outcomes that we can get.

823
00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:29.899
David Schaich (he): You see it. So

824
00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:31.540
David Schaich (he): saying, Omega.

825
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:36.569
David Schaich (he): so as opposed to just this very simple outcomes.

826
00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.700
David Schaich (he): the State could also include

827
00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:43.450
David Schaich (he): information about

828
00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:44.919
David Schaich (he): the position

829
00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.660
David Schaich (he): of the die after it's rolled.

830
00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:48.750
David Schaich (he): It's

831
00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:50.629
David Schaich (he): orientation.

832
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.610
David Schaich (he): not just which numbers on top, but which way the other numbers are pointing along the sides

833
00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.339
David Schaich (he): couldn't. The State could care about the

834
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:04.550
David Schaich (he): which we wrote to die, the

835
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.049
David Schaich (he): temperature.

836
00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.950
David Schaich (he): the room in which we will die.

837
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:09.459
David Schaich (he): and

838
00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.769
David Schaich (he): it's an in principle, any other aspect of the universe.

839
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.080
David Schaich (he): And

840
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:18.359
David Schaich (he): we've now gotten within

841
00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.150
David Schaich (he): 10 min out

842
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.069
David Schaich (he): halfway. Point 4

843
00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:23.370
this

844
00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.369
David Schaich (he): this 2 h block.

845
00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:27.850
David Schaich (he): so it may be worthwhile to

846
00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.180
David Schaich (he): take a

847
00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.470
David Schaich (he): 10 min, break.

848
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:34.620
David Schaich (he): stretch the legs refresh.

849
00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:35.549
David Schaich (he): and then

850
00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.350
David Schaich (he): dive in with some further examples

851
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:45.029
David Schaich (he): in about 10 min. There is something in the chat.

852
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:46.589
David Schaich (he): Augustine had

853
00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:49.470
David Schaich (he): the same answers that I just put on. Here.

854
00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:51.289
David Schaich (he): We will get to

855
00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:52.359
David Schaich (he): more

856
00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:54.419
non-trivial

857
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:59.090
David Schaich (he): examples of statistical physics. This is to

858
00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.609
David Schaich (he): anchor

859
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:05.560
David Schaich (he): what we are defining in systems that we are familiar with. So

860
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:07.120
David Schaich (he): pause that

861
00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:09.009
David Schaich (he): recording

862
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:10.740
David Schaich (he): for zoom

863
00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:13.569
David Schaich (he): that recording and let's do

864
00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:17.640
David Schaich (he): similarly simple examples to

865
00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:19.299
David Schaich (he): reinforce the

866
00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:21.060
David Schaich (he): the definition of

867
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:26.519
David Schaich (he): experiments and states and the outcome space. So.

868
00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:28.970
David Schaich (he): for

869
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:34.999
David Schaich (he): this example, our experiments can be flipping in coin

870
00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.319
David Schaich (he): to make this more interesting

871
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.210
David Schaich (he): 4 times.

872
00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:51.209
David Schaich (he): and rather than considering that 4 different experiments.

873
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:52.710
David Schaich (he): just consider that

874
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:55.260
David Schaich (he): single experiments.

875
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:58.170
David Schaich (he): you know, flicking back 24 times.

876
00:50:58.210 --> 00:50:59.269
David Schaich (he): and then

877
00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.239
David Schaich (he): measuring whether it comes up

878
00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:05.830
David Schaich (he): heads

879
00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:07.970
David Schaich (he): or tails.

880
00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:11.439
David Schaich (he): or into those 4 times.

881
00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.429
David Schaich (he): And then

882
00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:21.189
David Schaich (he): what sort of outcomes are going to be

883
00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:22.900
David Schaich (he): in the overall.

884
00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:28.209
David Schaich (he): set up all outcomes or out from space. A. For this experiments with

885
00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:30.680
David Schaich (he): this measurement.

886
00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.840
David Schaich (he): like a few of you are running down the answer

887
00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:35.239
David Schaich (he): Once you just shout out, not the entire outcome space, but just one outcome that will be in that set.

888
00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:42.120
David Schaich (he): So again I think you're getting to.

889
00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:48.980
David Schaich (he): So if we flip a coin once, we can then measure heads or tails.

890
00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:53.699
David Schaich (he): Here's our experiment is not just doing it once, but for coin flips.

891
00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.159
David Schaich (he): and then measuring has their meals after each of those 4.

892
00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:01.870
David Schaich (he): So an outcome of

893
00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:04.810
David Schaich (he): those 4 coin flips with that measurements

894
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:06.850
David Schaich (he): could be just getting heads

895
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:12.210
David Schaich (he): every time. So for sure, and

896
00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:14.559
David Schaich (he): it's right that.

897
00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:16.169
David Schaich (he): or heads in a row.

898
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.590
David Schaich (he): Another outcome would be

899
00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.009
David Schaich (he): the first 3 being heads.

900
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:23.020
David Schaich (he): the last one tails.

901
00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:24.379
This

902
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:27.810
David Schaich (he): it seems, from having

903
00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:31.740
David Schaich (he): 3 heads, third, flip being the tails.

904
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:32.959
David Schaich (he): And then

905
00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:34.919
David Schaich (he): there are

906
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.450
David Schaich (he): more possibilities

907
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.640
David Schaich (he): in that overall set.

908
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.650
David Schaich (he): Maybe I can ask you now that we've

909
00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:43.970
David Schaich (he): seen

910
00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:48.850
David Schaich (he): what sorts of outcomes are in the outcome space?

911
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:50.260
David Schaich (he): What is the

912
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.919
David Schaich (he): total number of

913
00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:59.160
David Schaich (he): outcomes that there are here? So the number of elements for the size of the outcome Space a. I'll just represent

914
00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:00.459
David Schaich (he): as that

915
00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:03.390
David Schaich (he): half sign, a

916
00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:10.059
David Schaich (he): 3 representative outcomes.

917
00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:12.250
David Schaich (he): There are more that

918
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:15.299
David Schaich (he): hopefully you can

919
00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:17.739
David Schaich (he): extrapolate from what we have.

920
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.219
David Schaich (he): How many are there

921
00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:20.370
David Schaich (he): in total?

922
00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:35.700
David Schaich (he): There will be? There's

923
00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:42.840
David Schaich (he): 4 coin flips, each of which have 2 possible outcomes. They're all independent of each other, one after the next

924
00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:44.580
David Schaich (he): into the power for

925
00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.120
David Schaich (he): 16.

926
00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:47.420
David Schaich (he): One of the

927
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:50.490
David Schaich (he): things you learn if you do a lot of computer programming.

928
00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:52.200
David Schaich (he): all the powers of 2,

929
00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:55.739
David Schaich (he): maybe for a more realistic example just to

930
00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:57.600
David Schaich (he): book apps.

931
00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.649
David Schaich (he): How these definitions map onto.

932
00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:06.089
David Schaich (he): you know, real physical statistical systems that we still will be talking about

933
00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:08.620
David Schaich (he): later in the module.

934
00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.450
David Schaich (he): See, I've got those number worth of Argon Adams

935
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:17.830
David Schaich (he): in a container.

936
00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.479
David Schaich (he): so

937
00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:22.520
David Schaich (he): that container has

938
00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:26.160
David Schaich (he): a solid box.

939
00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.770
David Schaich (he): I'll save it as

940
00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.740
David Schaich (he): some

941
00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:32.450
David Schaich (he): 10 of the power. 23.

942
00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:34.140
David Schaich (he): There are 2

943
00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:38.379
David Schaich (he): control, all in the power of

944
00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:41.810
David Schaich (he): quite a few in that container.

945
00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:45.390
David Schaich (he): and the state of

946
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:49.450
David Schaich (he): this is so. The experiment that we have

947
00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:51.870
David Schaich (he): is

948
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:53.339
David Schaich (he): just observe it.

949
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:57.189
David Schaich (he): All of these are done atoms in that container.

950
00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.729
David Schaich (he): the state

951
00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:01.580
David Schaich (he): of the world that we can get out of that

952
00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:06.370
David Schaich (he): information like

953
00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:07.490
the

954
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:09.479
David Schaich (he): positions

955
00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.390
David Schaich (he): of every single one of those atoms.

956
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:15.989
David Schaich (he): So, for example.

957
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:16.870
you

958
00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:21.419
David Schaich (he): 3, that I've drawn there after all the particular points we can enumerate

959
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.540
David Schaich (he): the positions for all of those atoms

960
00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:26.090
David Schaich (he): these that are going to deed

961
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:29.350
David Schaich (he): bouncing around

962
00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:31.020
David Schaich (he): some

963
00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.609
David Schaich (he): that we can also

964
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:34.709
David Schaich (he): include

965
00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:36.600
David Schaich (he): in the States so

966
00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:40.710
David Schaich (he): 10 to 23 velocities to go along with those 10 to the 24 positions.

967
00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:44.900
David Schaich (he): You could also specify. See the electronic states

968
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:52.029
David Schaich (he): on each of those 10 to the 23 atoms, or any of them in excited states

969
00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.399
David Schaich (he): or

970
00:56:54.830 --> 00:57:00.140
David Schaich (he): windows. Oh, these events have say orientations their spins.

971
00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.189
David Schaich (he): You can specify all of those.

972
00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:09.649
David Schaich (he): Maybe I can ask you.

973
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.500
David Schaich (he): based on this

974
00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:16.429
David Schaich (he): state. With some it's huge amount of information.

975
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:21.779
David Schaich (he): What are some things that it might be interesting

976
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:22.919
David Schaich (he): to measure?

977
00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:31.810
David Schaich (he): That's a great one.

978
00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:39.319
David Schaich (he): and

979
00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.380
David Schaich (he): and the period. So like that.

980
00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:47.529
David Schaich (he): yeah, temperature pressure is

981
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:50.969
David Schaich (he): so called through a dynamic observable, it will be

982
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.280
David Schaich (he): doing a lot with.

983
00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:53.509
David Schaich (he): and also

984
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:54.949
David Schaich (he): consider more generally.

985
00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:57.849
David Schaich (he): energy with that, so

986
00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.379
David Schaich (he): keep capacity.

987
00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:05.000
David Schaich (he): We have yet to define what saw as a so a forecast.

988
00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:10.509
David Schaich (he): and also the dynamical quantities like if there are any

989
00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:12.600
David Schaich (he): prince

990
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:18.790
David Schaich (he): in the flow of atoms within this container. Maybe they're going around in a circle at a whirlpool. We can measure that.

991
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:30.579
David Schaich (he): But all of these are very large scale quantities, single numbers, or a handful of numbers compared to the end of the power. 23 pieces of data

992
00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:32.100
David Schaich (he): stand as a whole.

993
00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:33.170
David Schaich (he): So that is

994
00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:41.239
David Schaich (he): hopefully driving home the contrast between the state of the universe with its huge amount of information.

995
00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:42.220
David Schaich (he): and it

996
00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.520
do you

997
00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:46.129
David Schaich (he): measurements that give us outcomes

998
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:47.329
David Schaich (he): that we can

999
00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:48.819
David Schaich (he): analyze

1000
00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:51.119
David Schaich (he): a more solid mathematical footing.

1001
00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:55.029
David Schaich (he): No.

1002
00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:01.180
David Schaich (he): moving on with just a few more definitions.

1003
00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:02.489
David Schaich (he): You can actually

1004
00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:07.300
David Schaich (he): generalize the concept of measurements

1005
00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:08.770
David Schaich (he): to

1006
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:12.319
David Schaich (he): introduce a

1007
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:14.830
David Schaich (he): unique label

1008
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:18.129
David Schaich (he): for each State.

1009
00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.120
David Schaich (he): and then

1010
00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:26.269
David Schaich (he): this is useful mathematically. If you want to

1011
00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:29.260
David Schaich (he): refer to a State rather than

1012
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:31.759
David Schaich (he): describing all of the

1013
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:36.160
David Schaich (he): information that it has, we can just refer to a unique

1014
00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:37.330
David Schaich (he): number

1015
00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:43.169
David Schaich (he): unique label that we assign to that particular collection of information.

1016
00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:44.499
David Schaich (he): And this is

1017
00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:46.190
David Schaich (he): a bit more

1018
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:48.500
David Schaich (he): general Van.

1019
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:50.220
David Schaich (he): The

1020
00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.280
David Schaich (he): concept of a measurements.

1021
00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:54.609
David Schaich (he): because those measurements are

1022
00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.540
David Schaich (he): in general not going to be

1023
00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:00.339
David Schaich (he): me

1024
01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.910
David Schaich (he): so. X

1025
01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:15.969
David Schaich (he): of Omega is likely to be the same for the large number of different states. Think of all the ways we could flip the coin, and it comes up heads regardless of when we flip it, how high we flip it, or where it lands. All of those produce

1026
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:17.760
David Schaich (he): that same measurement. And

1027
01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.040
David Schaich (he): typically

1028
01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.780
David Schaich (he): we're going to measure

1029
01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.190
David Schaich (he): what we care about.

1030
01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.220
Well.

1031
01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:24.869
David Schaich (he): you put that

1032
01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:27.540
David Schaich (he): we have to in order for you to care about

1033
01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:30.009
David Schaich (he): what we measure.

1034
01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:35.279
David Schaich (he): which

1035
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:36.500
David Schaich (he): means

1036
01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:42.149
David Schaich (he): carrying about that outcome space instead of all possible outcomes, like

1037
01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:45.629
David Schaich (he): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 for rolling a die.

1038
01:00:45.790 --> 01:00:47.850
David Schaich (he): heads or tails for flipping a coin

1039
01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:49.240
David Schaich (he): rather than

1040
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:50.529
David Schaich (he): the

1041
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:52.300
David Schaich (he): much larger

1042
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:54.320
David Schaich (he): set of all States Omega.

1043
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:58.149
David Schaich (he): So, focusing on those outcomes.

1044
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:59.879
David Schaich (he): It can be fine

1045
01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:02.680
David Schaich (he): and events

1046
01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.090
David Schaich (he): to be

1047
01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.049
David Schaich (he): any subset

1048
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:12.040
David Schaich (he): of that outcome space. Okay.

1049
01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:17.779
David Schaich (he): So

1050
01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.949
David Schaich (he): it's getting back to that example of the

1051
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.279
you had.

1052
01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:25.109
David Schaich (he): Yeah, from space, a

1053
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:27.450
David Schaich (he): being the

1054
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.310
David Schaich (he): 6 possible size

1055
01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:31.590
David Schaich (he): that could come

1056
01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.339
David Schaich (he): up on top when we measure that

1057
01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.529
David Schaich (he): so

1058
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:36.859
David Schaich (he): in events

1059
01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:39.440
David Schaich (he): it could be

1060
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:46.900
David Schaich (he): getting the 6 out of that outcome space, or just as well

1061
01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:48.790
David Schaich (he): it could be

1062
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:50.360
David Schaich (he): giving any other number

1063
01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.000
David Schaich (he): apart from 6.

1064
01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:57.939
David Schaich (he): So all those 5 possibilities, if you get any of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1065
01:01:57.990 --> 01:02:01.250
David Schaich (he): We can treat that as a single event

1066
01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:06.839
David Schaich (he): for the last one being another one being

1067
01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:08.390
David Schaich (he): 0, one

1068
01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:10.989
David Schaich (he): an even number

1069
01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:13.159
David Schaich (he): 2, 4, or 6.

1070
01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:16.849
David Schaich (he): All 3 of those are legitimate offense. They're each subset

1071
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:18.040
David Schaich (he): of the

1072
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:20.779
David Schaich (he): set of all possible outcomes.

1073
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:27.539
David Schaich (he): and it is these events to which we are going to assign probabilities.

1074
01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.500
and

1075
01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.090
David Schaich (he): it's the last step

1076
01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.780
David Schaich (he): for that, let me just say

1077
01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.939
David Schaich (he): similarly, have

1078
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:44.069
David Schaich (he): an event space like we have an outcome space collecting outcomes. The event space will just

1079
01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:46.660
David Schaich (he): be

1080
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:48.879
David Schaich (he): you set

1081
01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.680
David Schaich (he): of interest.

1082
01:02:59.030 --> 01:03:02.740
David Schaich (he): So it is the set of subsets of outcomes.

1083
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:05.979
David Schaich (he): And it is this to which

1084
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.470
David Schaich (he): you assign

1085
01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.000
David Schaich (he): probabilities.

1086
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:12.160
David Schaich (he): Any questions about

1087
01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.629
David Schaich (he): all of those definitions. Now that we are

1088
01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.389
David Schaich (he): getting to the

1089
01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.489
David Schaich (he): so now we have it.

1090
01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:33.720
David Schaich (he): the probability

1091
01:03:36.370 --> 01:03:38.089
David Schaich (he): is a measure function.

1092
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:42.480
David Schaich (he): I will call

1093
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
David Schaich (he): the

1094
01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:45.390
David Schaich (he): which maps

1095
01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:47.120
David Schaich (he): the event space

1096
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:48.700
David Schaich (he): on to

1097
01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:50.139
David Schaich (he): the real interval

1098
01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:52.789
David Schaich (he): between 0 and one.

1099
01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:54.569
David Schaich (he): So that

1100
01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:57.379
David Schaich (he): is a formal definition based on

1101
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:59.629
David Schaich (he): the

1102
01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:04.520
David Schaich (he): other definitions that we have gone through. See, will reach this event. Space. That is a

1103
01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:11.269
David Schaich (he): an attempt for a capital curse of F. On my part, if you're wondering what the school are.

1104
01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:13.920
David Schaich (he): I don't need to draw

1105
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:17.280
David Schaich (he): that letter too many times. So

1106
01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:20.769
David Schaich (he): what this means? It's giving us

1107
01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:24.940
David Schaich (he): a number between 0 and 100% 0 to one

1108
01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.649
David Schaich (he): for

1109
01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.169
David Schaich (he): each

1110
01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.860
David Schaich (he): events of interest.

1111
01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:34.490
David Schaich (he): So

1112
01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:38.649
David Schaich (he): each of the subsets of the outcomes that we are going to

1113
01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:39.759
David Schaich (he): look at

1114
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:41.350
David Schaich (he): and

1115
01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:48.279
David Schaich (he): saying that this is a measure function means, it has to satisfy 2 requirements

1116
01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:52.430
David Schaich (he): which

1117
01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:55.749
David Schaich (he): hopefully, we'll make intuitive sense.

1118
01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:58.920
David Schaich (he): If we look at the

1119
01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:00.759
David Schaich (he): probability of

1120
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:06.969
David Schaich (he): multiple, usually exclusive

1121
01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:11.020
David Schaich (he): events. In that event Space

1122
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:12.879
David Schaich (he): X and Y and Z.

1123
01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.410
Yes.

1124
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:15.330
David Schaich (he): no.

1125
01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:17.349
David Schaich (he): x and Y. Z. At all

1126
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:18.750
David Schaich (he): usually

1127
01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:20.709
David Schaich (he): exclusive.

1128
01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:23.669
David Schaich (he): Then that

1129
01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:31.800
David Schaich (he): overall probability, it must be the sum of the probability of X occurring. That is a number between 0 and one.

1130
01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:34.840
David Schaich (he): What's the probability of?

1131
01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:36.890
David Schaich (he): Why, on its own.

1132
01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.500
David Schaich (he): plus the

1133
01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.080
David Schaich (he): well, more generally

1134
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:48.250
David Schaich (he): comfortable

1135
01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.689
David Schaich (he): of events in the space.

1136
01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:57.330
David Schaich (he): the probability of that union must be the sum of probabilities of

1137
01:05:57.410 --> 01:06:00.309
David Schaich (he): the individual events being considered.

1138
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:02.290
David Schaich (he): So

1139
01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.980
David Schaich (he): you, we will have examples of this, which is to

1140
01:06:08.330 --> 01:06:15.309
David Schaich (he): state one right now, if we look at the probability of rolling a 2 or 3 or 4 from that D,

1141
01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:19.819
David Schaich (he): we will get the probability of rolling a 2, plus the probability of rolling a 4.

1142
01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:23.089
David Schaich (he): What's the problem with what's your building like? I said it 3

1143
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:24.850
David Schaich (he): hopefully.

1144
01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:28.770
David Schaich (he): intuitively obvious. Shout out. If not.

1145
01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:35.940
David Schaich (he): and there is a second requirement for this probability to be a measure function

1146
01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:37.609
David Schaich (he): that if we

1147
01:06:38.610 --> 01:06:40.140
David Schaich (he): set the

1148
01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.290
David Schaich (he): event space.

1149
01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.780
David Schaich (he): yeah, to be equal

1150
01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:46.790
David Schaich (he): to the outcome set itself.

1151
01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.019
David Schaich (he): So we are looking at the set

1152
01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:56.370
David Schaich (he): of all outcomes, each of which is mutually exclusive by construction.

1153
01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.699
David Schaich (he): This has to be equal to one for a 100%.

1154
01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:03.480
David Schaich (he): And that is just saying that the

1155
01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.089
David Schaich (he): experiments

1156
01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:09.069
David Schaich (he): and measurement we do, These 2

1157
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:10.790
David Schaich (he): have someone

1158
01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:14.939
David Schaich (he): measurable outcome.

1159
01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:23.779
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

1160
01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:26.219
David Schaich (he): it's also so

1161
01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:30.110
David Schaich (he): the probability of something happening used to be a 100%.

1162
01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:31.050
David Schaich (he): And the

1163
01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:32.939
David Schaich (he): in essence this is a

1164
01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:42.139
David Schaich (he): restriction on the experiments and measurements that we consider if we do an experiment that doesn't produce a visual outcome.

1165
01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:48.579
David Schaich (he): You might as well not have that it at all. It doesn't filter through to that event space and through the probabilities.

1166
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:50.100
David Schaich (he): So when we talk about

1167
01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:57.460
David Schaich (he): flipping a coin, we will talk only about the probabilities of it landing heads or tails, and not the probability that

1168
01:07:57.550 --> 01:07:59.409
David Schaich (he): a seagull through spy, and

1169
01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:01.409
David Schaich (he): it's it's in midair.

1170
01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:06.409
David Schaich (he): That's going to be an experiment that we discard and Don't include

1171
01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.710
David Schaich (he): in the set of outcomes.

1172
01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:09.819
David Schaich (he): or in

1173
01:08:10.050 --> 01:08:12.290
David Schaich (he): the probability space.

1174
01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:14.279
David Schaich (he): I'm. Shy

1175
01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.730
David Schaich (he): almost not to define. If we

1176
01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:22.080
David Schaich (he): put together

1177
01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.900
David Schaich (he): everything we defined

1178
01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:26.559
David Schaich (he): so far.

1179
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:28.699
David Schaich (he): What we end up with is

1180
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:31.540
David Schaich (he): the concept of

1181
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.800
David Schaich (he): the probability space.

1182
01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.439
David Schaich (he): hey?

1183
01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:37.990
David Schaich (he): And P.

1184
01:08:39.029 --> 01:08:40.200
David Schaich (he): So this is

1185
01:08:41.069 --> 01:08:42.649
David Schaich (he): bringing together

1186
01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:44.890
David Schaich (he): all of the outcomes

1187
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:48.060
David Schaich (he): of the experiments and measurement that we do.

1188
01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:54.790
David Schaich (he): All of the events, the possible subsets of those outcomes that we're interested in, each of which has

1189
01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:57.679
David Schaich (he): its own probability.

1190
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.240
David Schaich (he): This probability. Space

1191
01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:08.950
David Schaich (he): is

1192
01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.420
David Schaich (he): the basic

1193
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:17.430
David Schaich (he): object that we'll be working with in the form of what are called statistical ensembles.

1194
01:09:17.710 --> 01:09:22.790
David Schaich (he): We'll revisit that more formally once we get to it.

1195
01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:28.469
David Schaich (he): But a statistical ensemble is going to be like that example of argon atoms in a container.

1196
01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:33.260
David Schaich (he): it will be the probability of space that corresponds to some collection of particles

1197
01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:36.259
David Schaich (he): that involves in time. That's the experiment

1198
01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.790
David Schaich (he): that we observed

1199
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:39.990
David Schaich (he): and measure

1200
01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:42.910
David Schaich (he): the possible States. It has

1201
01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:45.720
David Schaich (he): with corresponding probabilities

1202
01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:47.269
David Schaich (he): that forms to you

1203
01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:48.750
David Schaich (he): basis of

1204
01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:53.109
David Schaich (he): the analysis that we will do

1205
01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.459
David Schaich (he): first, that we still need to

1206
01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.750
David Schaich (he): get to that wall of large numbers

1207
01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:00.910
David Schaich (he): and central limit theorem. At least

1208
01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.430
David Schaich (he): we stay in them

1209
01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:04.849
and

1210
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:05.969
let's

1211
01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.100
David Schaich (he): continue toward that, just by

1212
01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:14.989
David Schaich (he): talking through another example for the remaining definitions that we have

1213
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:17.179
David Schaich (he): all through.

1214
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:20.050
David Schaich (he): Let's suppose we have

1215
01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:23.029
David Schaich (he): some experiment that produces a

1216
01:10:23.850 --> 01:10:24.959
David Schaich (he): how many nights

1217
01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:29.590
David Schaich (he): a set of possible events. So the event space.

1218
01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:32.399
David Schaich (he): It's just going to be omega one.

1219
01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.840
David Schaich (he): some state omega 2,

1220
01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:36.550
David Schaich (he): and then up to

1221
01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:40.980
David Schaich (he): Omega sub capital n total number of

1222
01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.520
David Schaich (he): states that we have is just a capital N,

1223
01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.189
David Schaich (he): and then we

1224
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:49.559
David Schaich (he): measure

1225
01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:53.020
David Schaich (he): something of interest on each of those States.

1226
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:54.590
David Schaich (he): which is, we

1227
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:56.700
David Schaich (he): says, this can't give

1228
01:10:58.660 --> 01:10:59.889
David Schaich (he): the same

1229
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:01.849
David Schaich (he): outcome

1230
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:04.150
David Schaich (he): for

1231
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:07.489
David Schaich (he): different or distinct

1232
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:08.639
David Schaich (he): states.

1233
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:11.349
David Schaich (he): Mathematically

1234
01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:12.639
David Schaich (he): excellent.

1235
01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:14.439
David Schaich (he): We'll make this up all you

1236
01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:18.180
David Schaich (he): can be equal to X of Omega subject.

1237
01:11:18.610 --> 01:11:19.769
David Schaich (he): even when

1238
01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:23.920
our distinct states.

1239
01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.949
David Schaich (he): That's the example. We talked through

1240
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:32.729
David Schaich (he): slipping a coin and getting heads even when the coin flip was at a different time of different force.

1241
01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.319
David Schaich (he): So that means that the

1242
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:36.309
David Schaich (he): outcome space

1243
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:39.670
David Schaich (he): it's going to be

1244
01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:43.749
David Schaich (he): smaller than the overall

1245
01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:50.380
David Schaich (he): that space, this this set of possible states.

1246
01:11:52.070 --> 01:12:01.329
David Schaich (he): So we will have, say X. One you can use as a shorthand for some measurement on one of these states, Omega, not necessarily

1247
01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:05.390
David Schaich (he): like a one or an x 2 for distinct

1248
01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.380
David Schaich (he): measurement outcomes on a different set of states

1249
01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:13.100
David Schaich (he): all the way up to an X to a lower case, and

1250
01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:16.060
David Schaich (he): where number of elements in a

1251
01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:18.309
David Schaich (he): it's the slower case, and

1252
01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:19.389
David Schaich (he): which

1253
01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:23.169
David Schaich (he): can be no larger than the number of States that we started off with it.

1254
01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:24.389
We've

1255
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:25.869
David Schaich (he): put in here for you

1256
01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:30.799
David Schaich (he): construction that all of these measurements are to stand

1257
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:33.760
David Schaich (he): so if we

1258
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:37.059
David Schaich (he): choose the

1259
01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:39.950
David Schaich (he): that space of interest to be

1260
01:12:41.050 --> 01:12:42.880
David Schaich (he): that's outcome. Space

1261
01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:45.780
David Schaich (he): have equals day. Which just means that

1262
01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:50.410
David Schaich (he): what events will be interested in when the outcome is x one

1263
01:12:50.530 --> 01:12:53.099
David Schaich (he): another events, I mean the next 2.

1264
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:54.359
David Schaich (he): So on.

1265
01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:58.629
David Schaich (he): for all of the remaining individual outcomes, looking at the one by one.

1266
01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.159
David Schaich (he): These are all

1267
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:04.949
David Schaich (he): usually exclusive events by construction.

1268
01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.130
David Schaich (he): So the

1269
01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:07.670
David Schaich (he): probability, and

1270
01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:08.610
David Schaich (he): oh.

1271
01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:09.920
David Schaich (he): x I.

1272
01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:11.799
David Schaich (he): For Xj.

1273
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:13.540
David Schaich (he): Is

1274
01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:15.259
David Schaich (he): the some of the

1275
01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:20.219
David Schaich (he): to individual probabilities of those 2 outcomes

1276
01:13:20.610 --> 01:13:21.620
David Schaich (he): we can call

1277
01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:24.419
David Schaich (he): Probability P. All in

1278
01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:25.980
David Schaich (he): and Pj.

1279
01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.540
David Schaich (he): That assumes I is not equal to J.

1280
01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.290
David Schaich (he): And the

1281
01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:36.239
David Schaich (he): probability of the outcome space as a whole.

1282
01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:39.050
David Schaich (he): which is.

1283
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.440
David Schaich (he): how do you

1284
01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.790
David Schaich (he): X, one.

1285
01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.250
David Schaich (he): 4, x, 2,

1286
01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.400
David Schaich (he): or any of the other outcomes

1287
01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:47.920
David Schaich (he): up to Xn

1288
01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:51.099
David Schaich (he): that? It's the sum

1289
01:13:51.850 --> 01:13:54.429
David Schaich (he): I going from one to the

1290
01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:56.279
David Schaich (he): all of each of those

1291
01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:58.290
David Schaich (he): probabilities

1292
01:13:59.230 --> 01:14:03.580
David Schaich (he): that we've defined for the individual outcomes, and we know that this

1293
01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:09.879
David Schaich (he): as they add up to one. That's the requirement on the probability as a measure function.

1294
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:12.570
David Schaich (he): And

1295
01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:14.269
David Schaich (he): hey you.

1296
01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:16.710
David Schaich (he): it's yeah

1297
01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:20.860
David Schaich (he): switch to

1298
01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:22.970
David Schaich (he): a new page.

1299
01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:24.869
David Schaich (he): Make sure there's space.

1300
01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:28.029
David Schaich (he): Continue that example by it

1301
01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:30.090
David Schaich (he): special specifying.

1302
01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:31.340
David Schaich (he): Hey, you

1303
01:14:31.450 --> 01:14:34.660
David Schaich (he): there die again the 6 sides you've written down

1304
01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:36.490
David Schaich (he): the outcome space

1305
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.179
David Schaich (he): before

1306
01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.849
David Schaich (he): it was just

1307
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:53.530
David Schaich (he): the number that comes out on top.

1308
01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.499
David Schaich (he): And what we mean by fair

1309
01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.570
David Schaich (he): is that

1310
01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:58.950
David Schaich (he): the corresponding

1311
01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:03.159
David Schaich (he): probabilities for each of those 6 outcomes

1312
01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.119
David Schaich (he): are all going to be

1313
01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.450
David Schaich (he): you cool

1314
01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:08.849
David Schaich (he): Some probabilities

1315
01:15:08.890 --> 01:15:12.739
David Schaich (he): piece of one through piece of 6, or on the quote and just call that

1316
01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:13.599
David Schaich (he): P.

1317
01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.200
David Schaich (he): So.

1318
01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:20.369
David Schaich (he): acting with this probability measure function

1319
01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.550
David Schaich (he): on that.

1320
01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:22.730
David Schaich (he): the

1321
01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:25.849
David Schaich (he): outcome space for this role of the dial.

1322
01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:28.469
David Schaich (he): How was this that

1323
01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.380
David Schaich (he): some

1324
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:33.800
David Schaich (he): I one to 6?

1325
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:35.139
David Schaich (he): Oh.

1326
01:15:35.190 --> 01:15:36.809
David Schaich (he): it Constant P.

1327
01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:40.110
David Schaich (he): It's just

1328
01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:43.739
David Schaich (he): e plus p plus p plus p. 6 times

1329
01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:45.699
David Schaich (he): that has to be equal to one.

1330
01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:46.849
David Schaich (he): So

1331
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:49.830
David Schaich (he): we finally got into where some of you were already.

1332
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:55.950
David Schaich (he): that the probability for each outcome, the role of the fair die is 1 6.

1333
01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:00.070
David Schaich (he): We can do

1334
01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:01.830
David Schaich (he): that same for

1335
01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:05.080
David Schaich (he): the same exercise, for that

1336
01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:07.239
David Schaich (he): other example of

1337
01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:09.340
David Schaich (he): for

1338
01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:19.260
David Schaich (he): flips of the coin that we will now assume, we will now declare, is also fair.

1339
01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:28.290
David Schaich (he): There says that we have the equal probability of getting either the 2 outcomes for each flip, heads or tails.

1340
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:31.729
David Schaich (he): There's no bias in one direction or the other.

1341
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:33.620
David Schaich (he): so

1342
01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:35.180
David Schaich (he): we have that

1343
01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:46.379
David Schaich (he): when we flip it 4 times we get 16 possible outcomes, each of which has

1344
01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:49.010
David Schaich (he): equal probability. 2,

1345
01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:51.009
David Schaich (he): all of the others.

1346
01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.909
David Schaich (he): the PP. 16, and we'll call what you know it's again.

1347
01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:56.130
David Schaich (he): and by

1348
01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:57.559
David Schaich (he): acting on.

1349
01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:04.830
David Schaich (he): by considering the probability of an event space

1350
01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:09.999
David Schaich (he): that is equal to the outcome space. Each of those 16 possible outcomes

1351
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:11.389
David Schaich (he): you find

1352
01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:13.030
David Schaich (he): to you

1353
01:17:13.150 --> 01:17:17.179
David Schaich (he): some over 16 equal probabilities.

1354
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:19.650
David Schaich (he): which is 16 times

1355
01:17:19.710 --> 01:17:22.279
David Schaich (he): the unusual probability. It must be one.

1356
01:17:23.410 --> 01:17:24.780
David Schaich (he): Or, in other words.

1357
01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:25.990
David Schaich (he): that's

1358
01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:33.489
David Schaich (he): he is one over 16 for each of those 16 possible outcomes of flipping a Bitcoin

1359
01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:34.809
David Schaich (he): 4 times.

1360
01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.779
David Schaich (he): And now that we've determined the probabilities of

1361
01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:41.050
David Schaich (he): each other.

1362
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:44.870
David Schaich (he): these individual events, so identifying an events as

1363
01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:46.610
David Schaich (he): hey

1364
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:49.600
David Schaich (he): elements in the outcome space.

1365
01:17:49.670 --> 01:17:52.450
David Schaich (he): we can think about different outcome spaces.

1366
01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:53.610
David Schaich (he): So

1367
01:17:57.950 --> 01:18:02.990
David Schaich (he): so from space is a the event space. You'll think about a different event space

1368
01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:08.000
David Schaich (he): before I have 2 different events, 2 different subsets of the outcome space.

1369
01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:12.109
David Schaich (he): One of the subsets will be the outcomes where

1370
01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:14.529
David Schaich (he): number of heads

1371
01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:15.880
David Schaich (he): and

1372
01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:18.709
David Schaich (he): the number of tails are equal.

1373
01:18:19.230 --> 01:18:22.260
David Schaich (he): and another events can be

1374
01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:24.709
David Schaich (he): the outcome where

1375
01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:26.690
David Schaich (he): number of heads

1376
01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:29.020
David Schaich (he): and the number of tales is

1377
01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:30.240
David Schaich (he): different.

1378
01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:33.210
David Schaich (he): and we can now

1379
01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:36.340
David Schaich (he): based on the

1380
01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:38.139
David Schaich (he): other

1381
01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:44.120
David Schaich (he): requirement. For that your function to determine the probabilities of these 2 events.

1382
01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.290
David Schaich (he): So

1383
01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.559
David Schaich (he): there are

1384
01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:50.740
well

1385
01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:54.070
David Schaich (he): how many different outcomes are there that's fall into this

1386
01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.320
David Schaich (he): first subset, where a number of heads and tails

1387
01:18:57.410 --> 01:18:58.530
David Schaich (he): are equal.

1388
01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:05.969
David Schaich (he): What possible

1389
01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.199
David Schaich (he): outcome of this form is to

1390
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:13.889
David Schaich (he): have 2 heads at first, and then 2 tails. Thereafter

1391
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:17.560
David Schaich (he): what the opposite could happen. 2 tails and 2 heads.

1392
01:19:22.710 --> 01:19:24.669
David Schaich (he): and i'll just yeah go ahead and

1393
01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:28.310
David Schaich (he): like the possible permutations

1394
01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:29.590
David Schaich (he): of that

1395
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:33.060
David Schaich (he): outcome, the 2 heads into tails

1396
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:35.780
David Schaich (he): outcomes.

1397
01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:49.010
David Schaich (he): So those are 6 events that have an equal number of 2 heads and 2 tails.

1398
01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:59.269
David Schaich (he): It's a bit of thought hopefully. You will not object when I say that there are no other events from from the a point 4 times that have an equal number, they always have to be

1399
01:19:59.370 --> 01:20:00.580
David Schaich (he): 2 and 2;

1400
01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:02.660
David Schaich (he): and

1401
01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:05.850
David Schaich (he): because the probability of

1402
01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:07.639
David Schaich (he): this

1403
01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.669
David Schaich (he): countable union of different outcomes.

1404
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:14.040
David Schaich (he): It's just the probability of

1405
01:20:14.370 --> 01:20:18.200
David Schaich (he): but the sum of the probability of each individual outcome

1406
01:20:21.530 --> 01:20:22.920
David Schaich (he): Probability of

1407
01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:29.050
David Schaich (he): this first events in the event, space getting an equal number of Hasn't handles.

1408
01:20:29.890 --> 01:20:30.800
David Schaich (he): He is

1409
01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.190
David Schaich (he): 6

1410
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:36.199
David Schaich (he): outcomes, each of which has

1411
01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:43.360
David Schaich (he): that equal probability of one sixteenth, which is known as 3 days to its friends.

1412
01:20:49.370 --> 01:20:51.069
David Schaich (he): Similar bit of

1413
01:20:51.230 --> 01:20:52.620
David Schaich (he): consideration

1414
01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:54.700
David Schaich (he): we can think about

1415
01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:55.750
David Schaich (he): the

1416
01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:57.900
David Schaich (he): other events.

1417
01:20:58.150 --> 01:21:02.150
David Schaich (he): Yeah, Convince yourselves if you have not done so already at

1418
01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:09.469
David Schaich (he): every single event from flipping this point 4 times that does not give 2 heads and 2 tails has to give a different number

1419
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:11.169
David Schaich (he): of heads. And

1420
01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:12.240
David Schaich (he): so

1421
01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.100
David Schaich (he): you are 10 of those.

1422
01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:15.170
plus the

1423
01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:17.939
David Schaich (he): 6 out of 16 into those 10

1424
01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:21.880
David Schaich (he): as a one over 16 probability with a fair coin. What!

1425
01:21:22.150 --> 01:21:23.400
David Schaich (he): 5 days!

1426
01:21:24.370 --> 01:21:30.679
David Schaich (he): So These are the probabilities that map the events in the event space onto

1427
01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:33.619
David Schaich (he): that's real interval from 0 to one.

1428
01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:41.059
David Schaich (he): What we can do now is

1429
01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:43.210
David Schaich (he): introduce a

1430
01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:47.780
David Schaich (he): more interesting example.

1431
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:49.109
David Schaich (he): Sh! I

1432
01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:51.459
David Schaich (he): have put somewhere

1433
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:57.059
David Schaich (he): absolutely.

1434
01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.719
David Schaich (he): I don't think of their page there.

1435
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:02.559
David Schaich (he): and

1436
01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.200
David Schaich (he): this is

1437
01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:13.830
David Schaich (he): a European roulette wheel that is a gambling game

1438
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:18.349
David Schaich (he): which i'm not going to advocate

1439
01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.109
David Schaich (he): gambling. But

1440
01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:23.380
David Schaich (he): it is

1441
01:22:24.010 --> 01:22:27.750
David Schaich (he): something that gives us a lot of intricate probability to think about, especially if you

1442
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:32.840
David Schaich (he): find yourself by some strange coin in the Casino, where we let this ongoing.

1443
01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.970
David Schaich (he): The idea is.

1444
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:45.179
David Schaich (he): this is a wheel that spins a ball. It's thrown into that wheel to spin around in the opposite direction, and as it slows it will land in one of these

1445
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.469
David Schaich (he): 37

1446
01:22:46.730 --> 01:22:47.740
David Schaich (he): pockets

1447
01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:51.239
David Schaich (he): let's see space I have on the screen here.

1448
01:22:57.290 --> 01:22:57.990
David Schaich (he): and

1449
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:01.559
David Schaich (he): good

1450
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:06.520
David Schaich (he): the gambling works by placing a that beforehand on either which

1451
01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:12.819
David Schaich (he): pockets the ball will end up in for which some of these pockets you will end up in.

1452
01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:17.540
David Schaich (he): We can see you mentioned that 18

1453
01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:18.930
David Schaich (he): of these

1454
01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.700
David Schaich (he): pockets are.

1455
01:23:22.530 --> 01:23:23.860
David Schaich (he): You can also bet.

1456
01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:28.849
David Schaich (he): not the all ending up in any of those. There are 18 that are black.

1457
01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:30.230
David Schaich (he): and there is

1458
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:32.499
David Schaich (he): the one green pocket

1459
01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:34.189
David Schaich (he): number 0.

1460
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:36.450
David Schaich (he): There.

1461
01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:40.819
David Schaich (he): We need to zoom out

1462
01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.429
David Schaich (he): slightly to have

1463
01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:47.850
David Schaich (he): that figure on the screen and some blank space underneath it. So the outcome sets

1464
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:49.630
David Schaich (he): are they spin

1465
01:23:50.130 --> 01:23:52.000
David Schaich (he): of the roulette wheel

1466
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:58.230
David Schaich (he): measurements

1467
01:23:59.790 --> 01:24:02.869
David Schaich (he): the pocket that the ball falls into

1468
01:24:05.630 --> 01:24:06.780
David Schaich (he): gives us

1469
01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:08.040
David Schaich (he): 37

1470
01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:10.699
David Schaich (he): possibilities that we can

1471
01:24:11.190 --> 01:24:12.309
David Schaich (he): legal

1472
01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:15.970
David Schaich (he): 0, 1, 2 up to 36

1473
01:24:16.770 --> 01:24:21.099
David Schaich (he): specifying which of these 37 pockets at the

1474
01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:22.090
David Schaich (he): ball

1475
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:25.629
David Schaich (he): falls into. So we

1476
01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:27.769
David Schaich (he): should remember gambling with that

1477
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:30.059
David Schaich (he): we are dealing with

1478
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:33.690
David Schaich (he): the scare roulette wheel.

1479
01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:37.679
David Schaich (he): No, the same

1480
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:40.679
David Schaich (he): sorts of derivations that we did for the simpler examples.

1481
01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.170
David Schaich (he): How? What's that for you?

1482
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:45.469
David Schaich (he): Some of I 0 to 36

1483
01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:50.439
David Schaich (he): of equal probabilities for each of these 37 pockets.

1484
01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:54.269
David Schaich (he): As up to that 100% probability.

1485
01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.889
David Schaich (he): One of the words.

1486
01:24:56.670 --> 01:24:58.110
David Schaich (he): there is a conference

1487
01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.510
David Schaich (he): probability one over 37

1488
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:05.679
David Schaich (he): for each measurement outcome. The ball ended up in each of these

1489
01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.389
David Schaich (he): 37 pockets.

1490
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:13.940
David Schaich (he): We can then consider the

1491
01:25:14.410 --> 01:25:17.600
David Schaich (he): sort of event space that might be relevant to

1492
01:25:17.730 --> 01:25:21.250
David Schaich (he): a gambling game being played with this roulette wheel

1493
01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:24.300
David Schaich (he): that could be placed on

1494
01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:25.840
David Schaich (he): whether the

1495
01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:31.790
David Schaich (he): or the black pocket for that one

1496
01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:34.159
David Schaich (he): me in pocket.

1497
01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:36.509
David Schaich (he): We can check that. These

1498
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:40.960
David Schaich (he): events are all mutually

1499
01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:42.559
David Schaich (he): exclusive.

1500
01:25:42.610 --> 01:25:44.099
David Schaich (he): In that event, Space?

1501
01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:45.830
David Schaich (he): Yeah, pretty easily confused.

1502
01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:48.570
David Schaich (he): the corresponding probabilities again assuming

1503
01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:50.700
David Schaich (he): at the

1504
01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.769
David Schaich (he): wheel is fair. There are.

1505
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:54.569
David Schaich (he): she said, 18

1506
01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:56.389
David Schaich (he): red pockets.

1507
01:25:56.570 --> 01:25:58.080
David Schaich (he): each of which has

1508
01:25:58.630 --> 01:26:01.929
David Schaich (he): an equal probability, one over 37,

1509
01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:06.639
David Schaich (he): so that's probability of ending up.

1510
01:26:06.930 --> 01:26:08.159
David Schaich (he): and that first

1511
01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:11.970
David Schaich (he): subsets of the outcomes in our space.

1512
01:26:12.010 --> 01:26:12.920
Yes.

1513
01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.100
David Schaich (he): slightly under a half.

1514
01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:18.670
David Schaich (he): It is actually

1515
01:26:18.710 --> 01:26:20.320
David Schaich (he): same probability

1516
01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:21.599
David Schaich (he): it's ending up

1517
01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:26.589
David Schaich (he): in a black pocket. It's because there are equal number of red of black pockets.

1518
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:28.339
David Schaich (he): and then the green pockets.

1519
01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.909
David Schaich (he): the on option out

1520
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.320
David Schaich (he): 3 meeting

1521
01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:34.980
David Schaich (he): one over 37

1522
01:26:35.730 --> 01:26:37.059
David Schaich (he): probability.

1523
01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:39.850
David Schaich (he): and in roulette.

1524
01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:43.300
David Schaich (he): maybe a correspondingly higher reward.

1525
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:45.969
David Schaich (he): So we will actually come back to this example.

1526
01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:49.750
David Schaich (he): not today, but

1527
01:26:50.190 --> 01:26:51.670
David Schaich (he): possibly tomorrow.

1528
01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:52.860
David Schaich (he): and

1529
01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:55.079
David Schaich (he): do some computations of

1530
01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:59.200
David Schaich (he): how

1531
01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:03.730
David Schaich (he): they g the game. Can you expect it to proceed? Based on these

1532
01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:05.170
David Schaich (he): probabilities.

1533
01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:09.130
David Schaich (he): and

1534
01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:15.460
David Schaich (he): popping back to page we were on before, and just saying

1535
01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:17.610
David Schaich (he): one final thing about

1536
01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:21.710
David Schaich (he): these probabilities themselves. Now that we've defined the probability as

1537
01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:23.319
David Schaich (he): a measure function.

1538
01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:28.619
David Schaich (he): What we've been doing in these examples

1539
01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.750
David Schaich (he): my assigned

1540
01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:34.790
David Schaich (he): probabilities.

1541
01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:40.659
David Schaich (he): 2 events in the United States I can zoom back in.

1542
01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:42.609
David Schaich (he): but I don't have to keep that

1543
01:27:42.770 --> 01:27:44.399
David Schaich (he): the picture visible.

1544
01:27:48.450 --> 01:27:49.599
David Schaich (he): This we can.

1545
01:27:49.690 --> 01:27:50.950
David Schaich (he): I believe.

1546
01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:53.030
David Schaich (he): define or just call

1547
01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:55.720
David Schaich (he): the procedure of modeling.

1548
01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:58.539
David Schaich (he): So we are

1549
01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.110
David Schaich (he): modeling the behavior

1550
01:28:01.150 --> 01:28:02.090
David Schaich (he): of

1551
01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:03.959
David Schaich (he): these simple systems.

1552
01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:06.899
David Schaich (he): and in the cases that we've seen.

1553
01:28:07.050 --> 01:28:09.949
David Schaich (he): this assignment of probabilities has been

1554
01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.429
David Schaich (he): fixed by the symmetries of the system.

1555
01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:18.280
David Schaich (he): so

1556
01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:28.000
David Schaich (he): by assuming that the diver rolling is fair, we had say, a symmetry between each of the 6 size

1557
01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:30.290
David Schaich (he): of that fair die.

1558
01:28:32.110 --> 01:28:35.250
David Schaich (he): which, from the definition of the measure function

1559
01:28:35.370 --> 01:28:39.629
David Schaich (he): fixed to the probabilities of getting each of those outcomes.

1560
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:44.490
David Schaich (he): Now, if we don't know whether the dialer ruling is there?

1561
01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:48.139
David Schaich (he): Or if we have a more complicated system, or we don't just have

1562
01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:51.170
David Schaich (he): 6 outcomes for the symmetry between them.

1563
01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:55.650
David Schaich (he): We can do this modeling, or sign these probabilities

1564
01:28:56.170 --> 01:28:58.119
David Schaich (he): more generally

1565
01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:01.220
David Schaich (he): with what's called

1566
01:29:01.490 --> 01:29:03.130
David Schaich (he): the approach.

1567
01:29:05.410 --> 01:29:07.719
David Schaich (he): So we don't need to

1568
01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:13.430
David Schaich (he): so many symmetries, or you, or the fairness of any die.

1569
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:15.590
David Schaich (he): What we do is take that

1570
01:29:15.630 --> 01:29:16.790
David Schaich (he): experiments.

1571
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:18.549
David Schaich (he): You repeat

1572
01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.340
David Schaich (he): many times

1573
01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:26.980
David Schaich (he): any time.

1574
01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:28.480
David Schaich (he): measure or

1575
01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.340
David Schaich (he): monitor that random variable.

1576
01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:34.599
David Schaich (he): the outcome that we get.

1577
01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:36.469
David Schaich (he): And then

1578
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:38.129
David Schaich (he): from those outcomes.

1579
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:39.160
David Schaich (he): okay.

1580
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:42.990
David Schaich (he): and for the probabilities

1581
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.920
David Schaich (he): of each outcome

1582
01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:54.050
David Schaich (he): in the outcome space for each events in the event space.

1583
01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:57.830
David Schaich (he): thanks to what it's called the

1584
01:29:59.830 --> 01:30:03.419
David Schaich (he): log of large numbers, so we rely on.

1585
01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:14.150
David Schaich (he): But first for our next target for

1586
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.939
David Schaich (he): like probability foundation.

1587
01:30:17.670 --> 01:30:21.409
David Schaich (he): that's a will not go to unless there are questions about

1588
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:23.529
David Schaich (he): what we've done so far.

1589
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:28.219
David Schaich (he): What

1590
01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.730
David Schaich (he): seeing any?

1591
01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.080
David Schaich (he): Let's get on to that

1592
01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:36.589
David Schaich (he): all of large numbers, and

1593
01:30:37.570 --> 01:30:39.059
David Schaich (he): start off with

1594
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:40.740
David Schaich (he): it's restating

1595
01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:45.129
David Schaich (he): in particular context. So getting back to

1596
01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:50.250
David Schaich (he): and in that space which is a finite outcome, set that X one

1597
01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:51.820
David Schaich (he): x, 2

1598
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.070
David Schaich (he): up to

1599
01:30:53.550 --> 01:30:54.809
David Schaich (he): X, and

1600
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:55.900
David Schaich (he): that was

1601
01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:58.660
David Schaich (he): a previous generic example.

1602
01:30:59.390 --> 01:31:00.370
David Schaich (he): The

1603
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:02.099
David Schaich (he): probability, yeah

1604
01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:03.330
David Schaich (he): of

1605
01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:05.220
David Schaich (he): each outcome in

1606
01:31:05.530 --> 01:31:08.090
David Schaich (he): Yeah, from space. Xi. We can call

1607
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:09.950
David Schaich (he): piece of I

1608
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:11.820
David Schaich (he): number between

1609
01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:14.299
David Schaich (he): 0 and one inclusive.

1610
01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:16.400
David Schaich (he): with the sum over all.

1611
01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:20.570
David Schaich (he): some overall

1612
01:31:20.730 --> 01:31:24.160
David Schaich (he): and P. Sub. I. Adding up to 100%,

1613
01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:29.389
David Schaich (he): you privately.

1614
01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:34.140
David Schaich (he): You can express this

1615
01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:38.429
David Schaich (he): as a sum over all

1616
01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.820
David Schaich (he): outcomes in

1617
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:44.809
David Schaich (he): the outcome space, so i'll come back and the outcome space a.

1618
01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:48.250
David Schaich (he): The probability of that outcome

1619
01:31:48.670 --> 01:31:51.780
David Schaich (he): has to add up to one again, because

1620
01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:58.339
David Schaich (he): we're sending over an event space which is all of the outcomes in that outcome stays, say.

1621
01:31:58.610 --> 01:32:05.590
David Schaich (he): assuming the countable union with a finite number of outcomes. So this will generalize to uncountable

1622
01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.659
outcome spaces as well.

1623
01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:12.410
David Schaich (he): Then based on

1624
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:14.719
David Schaich (he): the setting

1625
01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:20.530
David Schaich (he): we can or based on this probability space, I should say, probabilities p

1626
01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:22.750
David Schaich (he): the events space at

1627
01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:25.750
David Schaich (he): a subset of the outcome space. A.

1628
01:32:27.450 --> 01:32:30.810
David Schaich (he): We can define. What is that? I suspect you

1629
01:32:31.570 --> 01:32:33.019
David Schaich (he): seen before

1630
01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:37.640
David Schaich (he): what the mean value of the outcome space

1631
01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:39.970
David Schaich (he): we'll call You

1632
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:42.100
David Schaich (he): Also write it as

1633
01:32:45.390 --> 01:32:48.629
David Schaich (he): X. In these angle brackets

1634
01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:52.460
David Schaich (he): so an expected or expectation value

1635
01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.569
David Schaich (he): all that the me is.

1636
01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:57.339
David Schaich (he): It's the way that some

1637
01:32:58.140 --> 01:32:59.740
David Schaich (he): over events

1638
01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:01.510
David Schaich (he): in that outcome space

1639
01:33:01.730 --> 01:33:03.300
David Schaich (he): of the events itself

1640
01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:06.539
David Schaich (he): multiply by its probability.

1641
01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:11.590
David Schaich (he): and hopefully that is

1642
01:33:12.230 --> 01:33:16.169
David Schaich (he): fairly familiar and just being recast in the language that we have

1643
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:18.099
David Schaich (he): introduced so far today.

1644
01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:31.380
David Schaich (he): There is a similar concept of the variance.

1645
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:35.830
David Schaich (he): Again, a property of the probability space

1646
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:37.370
David Schaich (he): that's

1647
01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:38.530
David Schaich (he): we'll call

1648
01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:44.070
David Schaich (he): sigma squared. So my 4 thoughts

1649
01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.920
David Schaich (he): what this variance is

1650
01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:49.610
David Schaich (he): is essentially a measure how much should be

1651
01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:53.440
David Schaich (he): outcome to the outcome space area around that mean

1652
01:33:54.990 --> 01:33:57.149
David Schaich (he): so an expectation value

1653
01:33:58.090 --> 01:33:59.610
David Schaich (he): of the outcomes

1654
01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:01.100
David Schaich (he): compared to the meeting

1655
01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:02.780
David Schaich (he): square.

1656
01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:06.260
David Schaich (he): the chrome, maybe some

1657
01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:08.130
David Schaich (he): over all of the outcomes.

1658
01:34:08.150 --> 01:34:09.070
David Schaich (he): Oh.

1659
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:15.560
David Schaich (he): this these fluctuations of X around the mean, squared and weighted

1660
01:34:15.810 --> 01:34:18.779
David Schaich (he): by the probability of each outcome. X.

1661
01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:20.719
David Schaich (he): And

1662
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:24.900
David Schaich (he): more generally

1663
01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:26.130
David Schaich (he): you can

1664
01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:32.359
David Schaich (he): to find the expected value of expectation. Value is probably what I will see if I haven't.

1665
01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.280
I can just

1666
01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:34.530
David Schaich (he): written this here.

1667
01:34:34.810 --> 01:34:36.500
David Schaich (he): Any function

1668
01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.189
David Schaich (he): of

1669
01:34:39.230 --> 01:34:40.539
David Schaich (he): the outcomes

1670
01:34:42.930 --> 01:34:46.430
David Schaich (he): has an expectation value given by these angle brackets.

1671
01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.450
David Schaich (he): It's the way that it's

1672
01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:50.760
David Schaich (he): over outcomes in the outcome space

1673
01:34:51.650 --> 01:34:52.850
David Schaich (he): F. Of X.

1674
01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.980
David Schaich (he): Weighted by the corresponding probability

1675
01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:58.269
David Schaich (he): of X,

1676
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:03.690
David Schaich (he): which is

1677
01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:05.540
David Schaich (he): it's golf

1678
01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:08.080
David Schaich (he): we can see. This is a linear operation

1679
01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.709
David Schaich (he): so that you

1680
01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:18.020
David Schaich (he): expectation. Value of the sum of 2 functions is the sum of the expectation values of those individual functions.

1681
01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.010
and

1682
01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:23.730
David Schaich (he): analogously, when functions are weighted by

1683
01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:32.590
David Schaich (he): any constant factor that will be useful when we look. I think next time, given the time

1684
01:35:32.690 --> 01:35:34.279
David Schaich (he): you will introduce the

1685
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:35.849
David Schaich (he): standard deviation

1686
01:35:40.350 --> 01:35:42.149
David Schaich (he): of the probability space.

1687
01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:44.340
David Schaich (he): this will be the same model

1688
01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:47.559
David Schaich (he): square root of the variance. Sigma squared.

1689
01:35:47.710 --> 01:35:54.309
David Schaich (he): We will be able to express this in terms of expectation values, and then start

1690
01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:56.890
David Schaich (he): working with it.

1691
01:35:57.710 --> 01:35:58.750
David Schaich (he): and

1692
01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:04.079
David Schaich (he): the context of a law of large numbers which will be

1693
01:36:04.190 --> 01:36:09.340
David Schaich (he): our topic for next time. So we've seen today our first

1694
01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:11.400
David Schaich (he): motivation for

1695
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:16.440
David Schaich (he): going through these formal definitions and considerations of statistical physics.

1696
01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:17.170
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

1697
01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:20.309
David Schaich (he): lots of Nobel prizes that have been awarded.

1698
01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:28.339
David Schaich (he): We talked about the 1926, 2,006 and 2,021 Nobel Prize for working statistical physics. Many more are you to come?

1699
01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:31.339
David Schaich (he): We check out the logistics.

1700
01:36:31.710 --> 01:36:36.160
David Schaich (he): Let me know if there's any concerns about that. And now we've gone through

1701
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:43.040
David Schaich (he): It's sort of what I find the most important with the physicists, which is the formal definitions of things like

1702
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:51.630
David Schaich (he): experiments, states, measurements, outcomes, outcome spaces of that spaces and probability spaces.

1703
01:36:51.710 --> 01:36:55.939
David Schaich (he): And now we're getting to the statement of the whole course. Numbers based on

1704
01:36:56.070 --> 01:37:03.349
David Schaich (he): those definitions in those concepts. That's where we'll pick up tomorrow afternoon. Not here, but next door.

1705
01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:06.970
David Schaich (he): Any final questions before you wrap up for this morning.

1706
01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:11.840
David Schaich (he): I hope to see you again tomorrow.

1707
01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:19.030
David Schaich (he): That one

1708
01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:21.010
David Schaich (he): question of the chat. Thanks.

1709
01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.220
David Schaich (he): thanks for joining remotely

1710
01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:24.740
David Schaich (he): what it's done.

1711
01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:28.910
David Schaich (he): I'm sorry if I just pronounce your name.

1712
01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:30.719
David Schaich (he): Have a recording

1713
01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:31.910
David Schaich (he): sure.
