1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.070
David Schaich (he): ...hit play with that

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.210
David Schaich (he): recording.

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:18.080
David Schaich (he): So we can get underway with the second-to-last tutorial for this module in this term. And

4
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.150
David Schaich (he): hopefully you are enjoying being done with

5
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.350
David Schaich (he): the last homework assignment --- only the exam to look forward to. And

6
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.600
David Schaich (he): what we can do in

7
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.930
David Schaich (he): this tutorial, and the final one next week, is look at some of the more

8
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.580
David Schaich (he): meaningful, or robust applications of the statistical physics tools

9
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.130
David Schaich (he): we've been developing.  But before we get into that

10
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.250
we have this

11
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.740
David Schaich (he): 6-digit code

12
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.910
David Schaich (he): for today: 2, 5,

13
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.240
David Schaich (he): 8, 9, 4, 0.

14
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:08.480
David Schaich (he): And, as always I'll check to see if there are questions about the interacting systems

15
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.730
David Schaich (he): stuff we've been going through in the lectures, or any other questions that have

16
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.980
David Schaich (he): come up about the Debye solid we introduced last week,

17
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.370
David Schaich (he): or for that matter any previous material in the module.

18
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.380
David Schaich (he): Not seeing any,

19
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.120
Yes.

20
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.160
David Schaich (he): mind you.

21
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.000
David Schaich (he): what we looked at last week in the first part of the plan for today

22
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.600
David Schaich (he): here introduced last week, the year

23
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.410
David Schaich (he): so called by a model of

24
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.530
David Schaich (he): he's building on the earlier work with

25
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.520
David Schaich (he): Einstein's model of solids that we

26
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.440
David Schaich (he): talk through the previous week.

27
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.419
David Schaich (he): You can recall the Einstein's model, which

28
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:11.630
that you

29
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.070
David Schaich (he): picture that you have to put up on the screen.

30
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.130
David Schaich (he): in addition to a solid as a collection of springs holding atoms into place, and predicted that

31
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:33.860
David Schaich (he): at high temperatures the capacity approaches it constant, which we use for the experiments. But that low temperature is that you can actually manage this exponentially and experimentally.

32
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.660
David Schaich (he): although he actually does vanish. This is he divided by the temperature? So he has

33
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.830
David Schaich (he): temperature goes to 0. This means that C is going to 0

34
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.300
David Schaich (he): linearly in the temperature with a

35
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.550
David Schaich (he): Cqed term

36
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.220
David Schaich (he): coming on top of that. c. Is

37
00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:01.290
David Schaich (he): the coefficient times T. Some other coefficient times to queue that disagrees with the

38
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.310
David Schaich (he): basically because of the

39
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.110
David Schaich (he): you added to that solid

40
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.460
David Schaich (he): for all this, not here to move in a coordinated collective way due to the interactions between them.

41
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.500
David Schaich (he): This is where to buy. hey? What?

42
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.820
David Schaich (he): And introduced a way to

43
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.450
David Schaich (he): treats

44
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.240
David Schaich (he): that interactive behavior as not interactive degrees of freedom

45
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.120
David Schaich (he): some way to transform the complicated system a couple of

46
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.370
David Schaich (he): into effectively gas.

47
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.970
David Schaich (he): not interacting phone numbers. So since particles of sound

48
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.930
you do

49
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.540
David Schaich (he): the equivalent of

50
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.490
David Schaich (he): for acoustic waiting for his.

51
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.000
David Schaich (he): our

52
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.180
David Schaich (he): acoustic ways, that whole sound and the first task.

53
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.279
David Schaich (he): The exercise you had to play with over the past week was to

54
00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.560
David Schaich (he): see, yeah.

55
00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:29.830
David Schaich (he): the basic functional form that this modeling predicts in the high, low temperature limits where it can simplify, and we can.

56
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.900
David Schaich (he): compared with that experimental data behind. Some of it works a type of assurance and breaks down at low temperatures.

57
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:46.520
David Schaich (he): And i'm guessing that this is something you'd like me to go through at least briefly. If you have

58
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:56.890
David Schaich (he): successfully. it's your extraction, because your horror with a lot of fun, tricks, and simplification sets. Come on that.

59
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.350
David Schaich (he): Let me.

60
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.170
David Schaich (he): and also useful to see the

61
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:11.080
David Schaich (he): other applications of statistical physics. So are there any objections to that, or I think you would

62
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:19.570
David Schaich (he): rather do. I should say, you guys. once we get through this talking through the divide solid, and that low temperature, heat, capacity.

63
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.870
David Schaich (he): introduce one final tutorial activity

64
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.950
David Schaich (he): which we'll look at

65
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:35.850
David Schaich (he): different lattice structures and some of the fun interacting systems and correspond to those with different source of behavior compared to the using model we introduced in the lectures.

66
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.020
David Schaich (he): I think it's still analyze in some cases pretty easily in some cases

67
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.180
David Schaich (he): not 2 weeks away.

68
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:55.130
David Schaich (he): so that will trying to get to that. By the end of today. I'll see you any. You objections to talking through this phone on gas calculation. Let's

69
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.160
David Schaich (he): spend at least a few minutes on that.

70
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:06.160
David Schaich (he): And, as hinted in this tutorial activity that it's handed out also on canvas

71
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.680
David Schaich (he): up to cost of factors, like

72
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.610
David Schaich (he): the speed

73
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.090
David Schaich (he): of the waves and number of polarizations that they have.

74
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.200
David Schaich (he): they both behave

75
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.230
David Schaich (he): qualitatively. So in terms of functional form. the same

76
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.210
David Schaich (he): in the particular.

77
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.450
David Schaich (he): Our calculation for you hold on gas when it reproduce the photon gas prediction

78
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:41.480
David Schaich (he): of the playing spectrum for the which is to say.

79
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.510
David Schaich (he): the average internal energy in the Grand Canonical. On some

80
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:53.890
David Schaich (he): it's pretty I pretty, but arguing that the chemical potential vanishes because these particles are easy to

81
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.060
David Schaich (he): dropping all kinds of factors and just looking at

82
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:11.530
David Schaich (he): personality relations. We have the familiar plant spectrum frequency viewed over E to the Beta Hr frequency minus one in the denominator

83
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.850
David Schaich (he): integrating over frequencies. And as we discuss last time

84
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.430
David Schaich (he): integrating from 0, so you

85
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:33.990
David Schaich (he): very low frequency, with a very long wavelength up to a maximum frequency. it is set by the number of atoms that we have in.

86
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.620
David Schaich (he): So this is the

87
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.860
David Schaich (he): it's maximum frequency corresponding to a wavelength where all the

88
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.910
David Schaich (he): next to each other, or possibly they can

89
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.810
David Schaich (he): very technically correlated.

90
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.150
David Schaich (he): and should say that for you.

91
00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:04.060
David Schaich (he): maximum frequency that we have now is given by

92
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.520
David Schaich (he): the number of atoms that we have per unit length.

93
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:17.510
David Schaich (he): and as before. we treat this by changing the variables to

94
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.530
David Schaich (he): next, which is Beta H. Bar Omega

95
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:35.120
David Schaich (he): for each over to you to give a temperature there explicitly. and the the integral over S. They all to the X. Max. That is just proportional to

96
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.940
David Schaich (he): an excellent frequency over the temperature.

97
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.480
David Schaich (he): and what

98
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:50.520
David Schaich (he): I will do when I write things in this way. So a level of dropping all constant proportionality factors we have.

99
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:56.540
David Schaich (he): I'll take a queue. Deal, mega that bring in 4 powers of

100
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:57.780
David Schaich (he): between them.

101
00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.880
David Schaich (he): Yeah, the integral from 0 to this maximum of X.

102
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.630
David Schaich (he): What I will do is take all of those Council proportionality factors

103
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:08.990
David Schaich (he): and call them

104
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:20.800
David Schaich (he): some simple TV. Here we need to buy a temperature. and that is divided by T. Here the temperature of the system at the upper now.

105
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:30.940
David Schaich (he): and in particular. This device I for sure. is proportional

106
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.840
David Schaich (he): to that density of

107
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.540
David Schaich (he): to the total number in 3 dimensions divided by it.

108
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:48.480
David Schaich (he): Yeah overall morning when I brought things wrong both here and last week this cube root is

109
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.140
David Schaich (he): going over at the

110
00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:06.970
David Schaich (he): number and the volume itself to get everything in terms of well, in your density, is It's turns.

111
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:14.920
David Schaich (he): hey? Objections about that. Sorry I it's sloppy at the end of last week, and just now.

112
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.050
David Schaich (he): So you seem reasonably content to

113
00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.100
David Schaich (he): believe that this is the forum for the energy

114
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:39.630
David Schaich (he): of the phone on the S. And this is basically all we need to extract a high, low temperature, but it's almost by here inspection. So at high temperatures.

115
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.100
David Schaich (he): when t is very large compared to the device temperature

116
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.620
David Schaich (he): that ratio of TV over team is much less than one.

117
00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.250
David Schaich (he): and

118
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:56.010
David Schaich (he): we are only integrating over very small values of X from 0 to something

119
00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.630
David Schaich (he): much less than what. So

120
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.080
David Schaich (he): all

121
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.470
David Schaich (he): x within the integral

122
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.250
David Schaich (he): in here replace

123
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:24.180
David Schaich (he): that e to the X minus one in the denominator. Just by the linear piece X, we have the energy proportional to 2 to the 4,000

124
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:32.440
David Schaich (he): integral with X cubed over X and X squared Dx, which is proportional to X cubed. Of course.

125
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:46.170
David Schaich (he): Yeah. we'll go back to 0 and 0 Q to 0 At the orbital we have the over t cube. so that is proportional overall to

126
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.700
David Schaich (he): 4 factors of T, divided by 3 package of T.

127
00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.740
David Schaich (he): So we get yeah, one factor

128
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.680
David Schaich (he): of T in there. So the heat capacity.

129
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:08.150
David Schaich (he): the year derivative of the energy with respect to this is a constant with high temperatures. which

130
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:14.800
David Schaich (he): is exactly what we've done for in agreement with

131
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:23.350
David Schaich (he): experiments. and. in fact, if we kept all the cost of actors we would find

132
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.200
David Schaich (he): not only 8 costs, but the same constant as the

133
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:33.750
David Schaich (he): the 2 models coincide as the temperature increases.

134
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:41.000
David Schaich (he): so that was the regime where they. the device out that it continues to work.

135
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:48.960
David Schaich (he): Looks have a choice where this upper bound on the integral.

136
00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.320
David Schaich (he): it comes very large.

137
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.790
David Schaich (he): And

138
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:55.130
David Schaich (he): yeah.

139
00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:00.500
David Schaich (he): the approximated by integrating from 0 to infinity

140
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:04.900
David Schaich (he): that this integral.

141
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.950
David Schaich (he): when the upper down goes to infinity.

142
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:23.970
David Schaich (he): turns into that for delicious combination of the functions. and we will see the functions so 6 times highlight. Fourth, over 90. What matters here is that this integral is just a

143
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:31.360
David Schaich (he): miracle constant. Just have a shirt in the limit of integration drops out

144
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.840
David Schaich (he): when it becomes low

145
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:42.540
David Schaich (he): one over. So we get that in. To. I question 48. We just have

146
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.100
David Schaich (he): that remaining factor in the form

147
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:57.520
David Schaich (he): in the heat capacity. It's proportional that he hued. which is exactly one of this room

148
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.170
David Schaich (he): in order to match the experimental data for these minutes.

149
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.270
David Schaich (he): So that's all that is needed for

150
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:15.830
David Schaich (he): the analysis of the device. Sell it, and it as forecast. Last week.

151
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.920
David Schaich (he): It captures one of the terms

152
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.880
David Schaich (he): describing these data, but not

153
00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:25.780
David Schaich (he): the leading term that intercepts that C over T goes to a constant Alpha

154
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:35.640
David Schaich (he): Any questions before we go into the second piece. Okay. The activity you had over the past week.

155
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.750
David Schaich (he): You're happy to

156
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.340
David Schaich (he): charge ahead to

157
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.310
David Schaich (he): the

158
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.970
David Schaich (he): final contribution that is coming from

159
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.560
David Schaich (he): the gas of electrons in these metals.

160
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.050
David Schaich (he): So we saw last week that

161
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.720
David Schaich (he): that's right.

162
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.850
David Schaich (he): And then your term in the dec capacity should be associated

163
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.150
David Schaich (he): to the

164
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.200
David Schaich (he): Okay. so to their friends electrons

165
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.850
the the

166
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.880
David Schaich (he): in these metals

167
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:29.860
David Schaich (he): the behavior of those electrons as a free gas set of temperatures should be the contribution.

168
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.260
David Schaich (he): You are missing

169
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:33.800
David Schaich (he): that's

170
00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.800
David Schaich (he): distinct from the behavior of the

171
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:42.450
David Schaich (he): to buy a model it is accounting for. and what we've seen.

172
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.330
David Schaich (he): or he's

173
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.640
David Schaich (he): low temperature novelistic for me on.

174
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.280
David Schaich (he): Yes.

175
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:05.020
David Schaich (he): there's General for a link. And dropping. replacing that one. It causes proportionality

176
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:19.110
David Schaich (he): over the energy. the fairy function. and then energy to the 3 half hour. And this is

177
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:25.300
David Schaich (he): rather than approximating that family function as just a step function that cuts off

178
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.750
David Schaich (he): the integral of energy at the chemical potential. We have to

179
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:35.930
David Schaich (he): keep it it's full 4, so it looks like

180
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:43.040
David Schaich (he): the occupation level probability. one over E to the

181
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:50.980
David Schaich (he): Times energy minus chemical potential plus one. So the minus one that we have the phone on the same

182
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.360
David Schaich (he): with it, using the free. That's power. right?

183
00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.040
David Schaich (he): And this is

184
00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:07.319
David Schaich (he): not an easy integral to do. A starting point is integrating by parts

185
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:13.040
David Schaich (he): so schematically. If you Haven't seen this for a while.

186
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:18.589
David Schaich (he): integrating by parts, changes in the form you Times TV

187
00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:28.930
David Schaich (he): into you and v evaluated at the boundaries of the integral. And then I think there's a minus, for

188
00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.320
David Schaich (he): to you

189
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.710
David Schaich (he): we all care about the overall science. Those are.

190
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.940
David Schaich (he): You can profound

191
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.770
David Schaich (he): if we this quickly

192
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:53.410
David Schaich (he): jump through this calculation, maybe leaving out some intermediate steps for the sake of time

193
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.790
David Schaich (he): that you can.

194
00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.600
David Schaich (he): and it's your cell phone on your own.

195
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.050
David Schaich (he): the you that we want.

196
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.100
David Schaich (he): You know, our integral for the

197
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.360
David Schaich (he): internal energy is just

198
00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.930
David Schaich (he): that correctly function, one over

199
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:16.170
David Schaich (he): the exponential factor plus one and Dv.

200
00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:20.900
David Schaich (he): The E.

201
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.810
David Schaich (he): So you time to be with us.

202
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:31.030
David Schaich (he): The ferry function a number between 0 and one times E to the 5 half power.

203
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:38.090
David Schaich (he): U. And V. So I believe it of the times.

204
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:43.260
David Schaich (he): a small number going to. So he goes to 0. We have e times

205
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.350
David Schaich (he): your number goes to 0

206
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.560
David Schaich (he): when the energy goes to infinity.

207
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:55.500
David Schaich (he): This function goes to 0 exponentially quickly that overwhelms the fact that

208
00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.680
David Schaich (he): from the

209
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:08.390
David Schaich (he): so they this is 0. In this case we just end up with

210
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.440
David Schaich (he): the the energy proportional to

211
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:17.290
David Schaich (he): the integral of that

212
00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:33.790
David Schaich (he): the do you? So e to the 5 Hands. the e. and then i'll keep that minus sign just right. Do you as

213
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.440
David Schaich (he): the derivative of that with respect to

214
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.190
David Schaich (he): differential.

215
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.130
David Schaich (he): where

216
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.740
David Schaich (he): the derivative of the

217
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.870
David Schaich (he): function. you know that is e to the

218
00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.160
David Schaich (he): beta chemical potential plus one.

219
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:09.670
David Schaich (he): and making our usual a slightly different substitution. X's.

220
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:15.830
David Schaich (he): the factor in that exponential.

221
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:22.650
David Schaich (he): We get one over you to the X plus 120 squared.

222
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.100
David Schaich (he): we have

223
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:32.650
David Schaich (he): additional. They go from the argument of the exponential

224
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.420
David Schaich (he): which

225
00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:41.830
David Schaich (he): we can rearrange

226
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.310
David Schaich (he): all of that on the screen. and.

227
00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:56.030
David Schaich (he): like the energy that we have proportional to integral. Now from X 0 to infinity.

228
00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.850
David Schaich (he): Sorry, this is still going to be

229
00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:05.390
David Schaich (he): the energy from 0 to.

230
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.960
David Schaich (he): And

231
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:13.590
David Schaich (he): although those 2 quantities are related by that relation.

232
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:23.400
David Schaich (he): They're proportional to each other. With this shift in data and this factor out beta from the chain rule, I can move into

233
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:30.490
David Schaich (he): the differential factor. And now change variables to X to that

234
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.840
David Schaich (he): when he is 0.

235
00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.090
David Schaich (he): X is

236
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.590
David Schaich (he): minus a of you

237
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.350
David Schaich (he): When you go to the X goes to infinity.

238
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.920
David Schaich (he): Yes.

239
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:52.190
David Schaich (he): still have.

240
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:56.300
David Schaich (he): The energy is a function of X now integral over X.

241
00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.680
David Schaich (he): And you, too.

242
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:08.580
David Schaich (he): the presence of X within that energy term, as well as this ratio of exponential factors.

243
00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.380
David Schaich (he): This remains a tricky integral to do.

244
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.100
David Schaich (he): We can get some kind of to which is by plotting it

245
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:18.380
David Schaich (he): versus

246
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:27.980
David Schaich (he): no here, since it's either the x over the X plus one squared it's dropping that

247
00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.770
David Schaich (he): factor out the energy that should be.

248
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:35.670
David Schaich (he): It's a small correction to exponentials.

249
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:37.650
It's

250
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:43.890
David Schaich (he): clear at this combination of exponentials is suppressed.

251
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.630
David Schaich (he): We're both large and small. X. So this gives us the freedom

252
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.310
David Schaich (he): to extend

253
00:22:54.330 --> 00:23:00.620
David Schaich (he): the integral from minus infinity to infinity often simpler than happy.

254
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.700
David Schaich (he): Let's see. and

255
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:19.830
David Schaich (he): we can justify the exponential suppression just by looking at that limit where X is a very negative number. So

256
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.580
David Schaich (he): So in that regime you the X over

257
00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:26.880
David Schaich (he): into the X plus one squared

258
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.030
David Schaich (he): access.

259
00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:36.570
David Schaich (he): large and magazine and negative. Those exponential factors are very small. The denominator is approximately

260
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:37.820
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

261
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:40.840
David Schaich (he): This

262
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:50.480
David Schaich (he): itself, as I said. the exponential of the right negative number is much less than one. What you're using exponentially suppressed

263
00:23:53.510 --> 00:24:01.560
David Schaich (he): correction to the calculation, just by extending the you can to a similar argument for hey?

264
00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:07.960
David Schaich (he): Positive numbers. For now the exponential.

265
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.570
David Schaich (he): it's

266
00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:16.540
David Schaich (he): one over 80 X. Whatever something on her, she is very small.

267
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.440
David Schaich (he): and even with the

268
00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:28.510
David Schaich (he): even the 5 have power in there, we can be confident that the

269
00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.020
David Schaich (he): integrated is

270
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:37.340
David Schaich (he): sharply peaked around it.

271
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.130
David Schaich (he): X equals 0, which corresponds

272
00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:47.830
David Schaich (he): it's still on the screen when X is 0 energy.

273
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.860
David Schaich (he): So this is where

274
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:57.280
David Schaich (he): you, a full Hitler expansion of the energy as a function of X

275
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:02.570
David Schaich (he): and

276
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.540
David Schaich (he): E equals

277
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:11.760
David Schaich (he): next just the derivative.

278
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.840
David Schaich (he): Which is either the 3 has evaluated as you.

279
00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.460
David Schaich (he): I have leaves. Use the one half

280
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.480
David Schaich (he): which we can. Now this gives us a way to

281
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:40.710
David Schaich (he): express the full, integral consistently in terms of X. Instead of mixing X and the energy

282
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:47.740
David Schaich (he): that you, the 5 hands. That's 5 hands.

283
00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:53.920
David Schaich (he): So e minus mu is x over beta, or x times t.

284
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.310
The 3 have since. Similarly.

285
00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.320
David Schaich (he): this next term

286
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.180
David Schaich (he): is x t squared one half back to review.

287
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.380
David Schaich (he): So just looking at

288
00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.850
David Schaich (he): these first 3 terms

289
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:22.030
David Schaich (he): in the it will have some cost to a

290
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:30.120
David Schaich (he): you get to roll. Yes. the x plus one square.

291
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:35.550
David Schaich (he): with nothing else. Just another view that we absorbed into a

292
00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:49.190
David Schaich (he): the second term. Here's us x times t times e to the x yes, plus one squared.

293
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:55.970
David Schaich (he): and then you see. pull it out.

294
00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.640
David Schaich (he): X squared e to the X

295
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:06.160
David Schaich (he): in the X plus one squared. Dx. Those integrals are all Google. Sorry. There they are

296
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.270
David Schaich (he): on the screen before you go.

297
00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.220
David Schaich (he): Those integrals are all

298
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:14.620
David Schaich (he): doable without too much effort.

299
00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:23.950
David Schaich (he): But what we can see is that if we take the derivative of the energy with respect to the temperature. this first term will

300
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:32.420
David Schaich (he): healthy keep capacity. There is no dependence on the temperature. It is

301
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:38.550
David Schaich (he): that does not contribute to the capacity, for after the second integral

302
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.080
David Schaich (he): is integrating an up function, so from

303
00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.120
David Schaich (he): minus

304
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:50.480
David Schaich (he): infinity to 0, the integrand is equal and opposite to its value from 0 to plus infinity over overall.

305
00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.590
David Schaich (he): That correct yeah

306
00:27:54.660 --> 00:28:02.260
David Schaich (he): goes to 0. And what we are finally left with is this.

307
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.550
David Schaich (he): this integral which

308
00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:14.150
David Schaich (he): it's great to some numerical. and in the end anything that

309
00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:23.080
David Schaich (he): derivative just this term proportional to the derivative of t squared with respect to T.

310
00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:31.810
David Schaich (he): So that is how the device solid works to

311
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.110
David Schaich (he): reproduce experimental data and overcome that the shortcomings

312
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:39.520
David Schaich (he): of the I just don't know

313
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.380
David Schaich (he): It's a good place to policy. If there are questions

314
00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.390
David Schaich (he): about

315
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.490
David Schaich (he): what we've gone through, looking at. hey?

316
00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.250
David Schaich (he): Very accurate description of

317
00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:00.170
David Schaich (he): 10 to the power 23 atoms that are

318
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:07.740
David Schaich (he): digging around in these materials along with a gas of electron that's floating amongst them at no temperatures.

319
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:13.470
David Schaich (he): It's an extraordinarily complicated system. Yeah. We have been able to

320
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.660
David Schaich (he): describe very accurately in terms of

321
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.380
David Schaich (he): simple linear and human functions.

322
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:24.360
David Schaich (he): Just from what we've dealt with to phone gases.

323
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:37.150
David Schaich (he): I hope it this sort of

324
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.230
David Schaich (he): direct application to the full application.

325
00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.840
David Schaich (he): something enjoyable that

326
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:59.330
David Schaich (he): it's nice to see you. We're able to do this after just here Single module through statistical tools. 2

327
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:03.180
David Schaich (he): treats as many other wide degrees of freedom

328
00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:05.670
David Schaich (he): and get

329
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:09.080
David Schaich (he): emergence. Collective behavior

330
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.240
David Schaich (he): predicted very accurate. When you call that

331
00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:17.940
David Schaich (he): so

332
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:29.290
David Schaich (he): little over halfway through one like tutorials a day. So it's a good time to terms, you will next standard final activity.

333
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.850
David Schaich (he): which we have a mix of

334
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:43.120
David Schaich (he): easy things to think about, and also a we're challenging computation. If you you might have a taste for

335
00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.150
David Schaich (he): connecting

336
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:52.400
David Schaich (he): the behavior of these statistical systems to

337
00:30:53.790 --> 00:31:01.580
David Schaich (he): to real materials which often have structures of their atoms and voices more complicated

338
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:05.910
David Schaich (he): the simple cubic case that we are looking at in the lecture.

339
00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:07.930
David Schaich (he): So.

340
00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:18.440
David Schaich (he): as always, this tutorial activities on the camera site. If you don't want to rely on them. What time Talking to a project.

341
00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:22.470
David Schaich (he): Sure help, you, sir. Fantastic man!

342
00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:33.800
David Schaich (he): I can't the site on that

343
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:36.880
David Schaich (he): any device

344
00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.930
David Schaich (he): so in lecture we've been looking at d-dimensional

345
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:52.480
David Schaich (he): square lattice. one on the left. where you see each site has

346
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:55.880
David Schaich (he): in 2 dimensions for nearest neighbors.

347
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.520
David Schaich (he): so obvious by inspection

348
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:03.830
David Schaich (he): the term year 2.

349
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:08.260
David Schaich (he): Look at these lasses, so

350
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:15.160
David Schaich (he): this cubic classes, and

351
00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:22.480
David Schaich (he): the square lattice and 2D. And the number of nearest neighbors. so

352
00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:30.970
David Schaich (he): often called in sort of more full discussions. this coordination number.

353
00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:36.100
David Schaich (he): So that is where there is this very regular structure, and every

354
00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:39.590
David Schaich (he): sites has a fixed number of

355
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.990
David Schaich (he): nearest neighbors. All the

356
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:45.950
David Schaich (he): coordination number

357
00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:02.350
David Schaich (he): to the for these cubic lattices that we put that in the lecture

358
00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:04.720
here for you.

359
00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:12.930
David Schaich (he): You've seen the the number of links per site, the coordination number.

360
00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.700
David Schaich (he): It's 2D, 2 dimensions.

361
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.150
David Schaich (he): It goes to the 4 that we just through here.

362
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:26.130
David Schaich (he): and we can compress this with a few other simple, regular lattice structure is that

363
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.320
David Schaich (he): completely fill the 2 dimensional plane

364
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.550
David Schaich (he): seen before.

365
00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:35.170
David Schaich (he): Those are going here.

366
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.390
David Schaich (he): First of all, it's called

367
00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:41.750
David Schaich (he): where we can count that

368
00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.290
David Schaich (he): each site has 3 nearest neighbors.

369
00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:54.290
David Schaich (he): so it's to be heightened. Let us

370
00:33:55.610 --> 00:34:00.290
David Schaich (he): it also be generalized to higher dimensions, harder to picture, which is

371
00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.070
David Schaich (he): why the picture is not

372
00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.680
David Schaich (he): tutorial activity.

373
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:11.570
David Schaich (he): but to the coordination number

374
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.730
David Schaich (he): has a simple relation to.

375
00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.310
David Schaich (he): Did you mention elevated?

376
00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:26.870
David Schaich (he): It's just d plus one, which in 2 dimensions that those 3 that we accounted in here.

377
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:39.550
David Schaich (he): There's a story that I can tell about the higher dimensional versions of this honeycomb that is being called hyper dynamic lattices.

378
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.929
David Schaich (he): just because of the

379
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.370
David Schaich (he): I can structure that comes out

380
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.739
David Schaich (he): of the centers

381
00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:56.870
David Schaich (he): of the faces in this platform. Not to It's a fun bit of. Let us transport it

382
00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.340
David Schaich (he): as we go through things.

383
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:05.420
David Schaich (he): Let's instead move on to consider what happens if we

384
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:10.580
David Schaich (he): all of the centerpoints in the

385
00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:17.520
David Schaich (he): and you all mixed up between the centers with your the existing. So it's

386
00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.360
David Schaich (he): and the centers.

387
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:32.880
David Schaich (he): These hexagons get broken up into collections of 6 triangles. that this exactly what's wrong with that in this room those plots, the triangular lattice

388
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:34.920
David Schaich (he): I can see.

389
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:41.620
David Schaich (he): actually gone still hiding in there from collections of 6 of the triangles.

390
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.040
David Schaich (he): So it is super cell

391
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:51.220
David Schaich (he): build out of the

392
00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.470
David Schaich (he): the higher dimensional generalization of

393
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:57.390
I know that this is called

394
00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.540
David Schaich (he): 86,

395
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:07.410
David Schaich (he): many fun properties, of those things, like the maximum efficiency for sear hacking

396
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:09.670
David Schaich (he): as well as

397
00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:12.300
David Schaich (he): connections to

398
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.970
David Schaich (he): super symmetry.

399
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:23.530
David Schaich (he): But stay at the basic well, for now the coordination number

400
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:27.050
David Schaich (he): here is 6 and 2 dimensions.

401
00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:41.880
David Schaich (he): a general license to twice that coordination. So 2 times the dimensionality plus one. it's a 6 when the equals 2,

402
00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:57.390
David Schaich (he): so these 3 lattice structures are very clearly distinguished by the number of nearest neighbors. Some more pictures at the bottom of this page are showing.

403
00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.560
David Schaich (he): This is the

404
00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.340
David Schaich (he): version of the

405
00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:10.270
David Schaich (he): So it's a 3.

406
00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:16.230
David Schaich (he): Also notice the by a central cubic class or

407
00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.540
David Schaich (he): Ecc. And we can account.

408
00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:30.930
David Schaich (he): when D equals 3 or a triangle lattice in 3 dimensions. We have 2 times 4. It gives 8 inverse neighbors for and for this purple site that is

409
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.980
David Schaich (he): in the center of a few that it's kind of

410
00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:44.390
David Schaich (he): properly projected the year. James. There's neighbors that it has

411
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:49.910
David Schaich (he): label and number from one to 8

412
00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:53.180
David Schaich (he): 8 quarters of the unit queue.

413
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.240
David Schaich (he): What other

414
00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:01.060
David Schaich (he): interesting way to structure. to mention, at least in 2D.

415
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:08.640
David Schaich (he): So not trying to generalize the so-called to go away that it's not higher dimensions

416
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:17.190
David Schaich (he): I believe people may come from a Japanese. We're related to what basket we then this sort of structure shows up in

417
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.430
David Schaich (he): textiles, and those with the patterns

418
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.130
David Schaich (he): each side has

419
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:28.250
David Schaich (he): when you're

420
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.260
David Schaich (he): 3

421
00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:37.350
David Schaich (he): rotated as we go from one site to the next. I like the

422
00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.140
David Schaich (he): that we may be more familiar with.

423
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:43.960
David Schaich (he): but here

424
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:56.460
David Schaich (he): the Us. We have a coordination number of 4, so the same number of nearest neighbors as the square, we but clearly by inspection.

425
00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:01.550
David Schaich (he): This is a distinct latter structure from

426
00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.160
David Schaich (he): the square lattice.

427
00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:10.700
David Schaich (he): despite the same number of years later. So the coordination number is not everything. but it is something and

428
00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.440
David Schaich (he): something that's

429
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:17.390
David Schaich (he): on. The behavior of

430
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:26.840
David Schaich (he): systems of Adams model is interacting with live on the

431
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:29.010
David Schaich (he): So if we

432
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:33.770
David Schaich (he): take our using model and

433
00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:40.050
David Schaich (he): generalize it to have and energy.

434
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:47.690
David Schaich (he): How's the coefficient J. In front of the

435
00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:53.300
David Schaich (he): some over the years that are interacting in this way.

436
00:39:54.910 --> 00:40:01.360
David Schaich (he): Put it in the field term for convenience and for the time being, just to turn it off

437
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:12.880
David Schaich (he): that external magnetic field and look at only the interactions. This J. Is the way of parameters in the strength of those interactions.

438
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:24.370
David Schaich (he): But what is interesting is what happens. If Jay changes sign. we could have

439
00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:30.510
David Schaich (he): a positive interaction, strength, or a negative interruptive strength equally well in this expression.

440
00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:31.910
David Schaich (he): and

441
00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:38.500
David Schaich (he): a question for you to consider a over the next

442
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:46.310
David Schaich (he): 10 min or so. the coming weekend back to talk through the

443
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:52.590
David Schaich (he): the results next Thursday tutorial.

444
00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:09.220
David Schaich (he): What are the ground States out of this generalized using model. one or 2 cases of J greater than 0, less than 0.

445
00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:20.160
David Schaich (he): When the U.S.A. Repairs in this, some over day in K. I come in from

446
00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.360
David Schaich (he): square honeycomb

447
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:26.790
David Schaich (he): or triangular

448
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.470
David Schaich (he): lattice structures.

449
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:36.960
David Schaich (he): So this is

450
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:48.430
David Schaich (he): ideally, I conceptual question that you should be able to. I have an argument for the form of the ground state.

451
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.770
David Schaich (he): just from the inspection of

452
00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.750
David Schaich (he): if I have a series and the interacting

453
00:41:55.860 --> 00:42:01.760
David Schaich (he): terms defining the using model. So without doing any detail that practical calculation.

454
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.480
David Schaich (he): And

455
00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:13.110
David Schaich (he): is it for the follow up to that? Yes.

456
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:15.970
David Schaich (he): Are there

457
00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:19.350
David Schaich (he): any potential order parameters

458
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:27.090
David Schaich (he): that would distinguish those ground States from the disorder state that we expect.

459
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:30.830
David Schaich (he): It's high temperature for the using model

460
00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:37.300
David Schaich (he): on any of these lattice structures where the energy becomes essentially negative compared to

461
00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:38.630
David Schaich (he): the temperature.

462
00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:54.960
David Schaich (he): And i'm just thinking whether i'm up to hold up the the last part. This activity, which is it? Much more complicated

463
00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:59.400
David Schaich (he): set of questions. So you've got this question about it's over parameters

464
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:00.630
David Schaich (he): something. You can

465
00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:05.300
David Schaich (he): look at the system and try to

466
00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:09.020
David Schaich (he): answer that just by inspection

467
00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:24.590
David Schaich (he): there is another generalization of lattices that we can do. and I think I will just read this problem. You can read it. I didn't really know about it in the activity. just in case any of you are

468
00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.400
David Schaich (he): curious to play with. Let's call this complete graph

469
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:36.330
David Schaich (he): the fully connected by this, whatever. Every single site is a nearest neighbor of every other site

470
00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:46.820
David Schaich (he): here. So there are links which are technically the same length.

471
00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:54.090
David Schaich (he): this 2 dimensional projection links between every single pair of sites.

472
00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:56.150
David Schaich (he): So it defines.

473
00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:05.560
David Schaich (he): I like to call it fully connected with us. What shows up in

474
00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:10.360
David Schaich (he): Wikipedia and some other literature as a complete graph.

475
00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:13.260
David Schaich (he): Yes.

476
00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:17.140
David Schaich (he): that's the name suggests applications to

477
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:20.080
David Schaich (he): graph theory and networks.

478
00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.100
David Schaich (he): and if we consider it

479
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:33.120
David Schaich (he): in generalization of the using model that's defined on this fully connected like this.

480
00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:35.540
David Schaich (he): because

481
00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:46.910
David Schaich (he): all sites are connected to all the others that some over links, just because they sum over all of the sex themselves

482
00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:50.730
David Schaich (he): with J. Less than K. To avoid all accounting.

483
00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:54.610
David Schaich (he): you can

484
00:44:54.950 --> 00:45:03.110
David Schaich (he): equally well through the bill. some overall different pairs of sites. That's

485
00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:19.720
David Schaich (he): and this is a system of thanks to the structure of that fully connected lattice that can be solved exactly. I'm like easy model

486
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:20.550
on it.

487
00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:23.890
David Schaich (he): Two-dimensional cubic lattices that we're doing in the lectures.

488
00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:27.770
David Schaich (he): So

489
00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.330
David Schaich (he): the exact solution

490
00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.190
David Schaich (he): gives a closed form analytic expression

491
00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.920
David Schaich (he): for the partition function that corresponds to this energy.

492
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.810
David Schaich (he): I should mention that Peter

493
00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:56.930
David Schaich (he): Inclusion of the number of sites in the Co. In the interaction strength. What this lattice is

494
00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:08.840
David Schaich (he): in there, just to ensure that the energy per site remains finite as and goes to infinity in that thermodynamic moment that we've been discussing in the lectures and

495
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.420
David Schaich (he): actually sold it.

496
00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:14.800
David Schaich (he): The system is

497
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:20.360
David Schaich (he): trickier. It's a more substantial calculation that

498
00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.240
David Schaich (he): some of you may want to play with over the coming week. We

499
00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:40.600
David Schaich (he): probably take a report at how that calculation goes next Thursday, but I just mentioned that it is the way it is to work that was awarded the 2021 Nobel prize

500
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:44.690
David Schaich (he): perfect. So not this past year year before that

501
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:52.370
David Schaich (he): Georgio crazy received part of the Nobel Prize for solving

502
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:55.550
David Schaich (he): similar systems like this. You know the spin classes.

503
00:46:55.750 --> 00:47:04.820
David Schaich (he): but the interactions frame is actually allowed to vary from link to link at the different values of the interactions transport link

504
00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.390
David Schaich (he): rather than being a constant or drawing from the Gaussian distribution.

505
00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:14.020
David Schaich (he): That is too wrap up with the hints, for

506
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:19.740
David Schaich (he): there's a few. Once we take this calculation. Hey? Here

507
00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.120
David Schaich (he): good way to approach it is to

508
00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:28.700
David Schaich (he): organize things as

509
00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:33.750
David Schaich (he): is so over the values of the magnetization

510
00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:47.990
David Schaich (he): in that partition function. so is that we're given by some of the organization from minus one up to one.

511
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:59.210
David Schaich (he): some expression, and when it is large we got us to the organization in that range are very smoothly varying and put together.

512
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:04.850
David Schaich (he): The process of this has an integral over the magnetization.

513
00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:11.380
David Schaich (he): So why is we express this energy

514
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.660
David Schaich (he): in terms of the organization

515
00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:22.140
David Schaich (he): itself to go into the exponential factor that shows up in the partition function. So

516
00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.120
David Schaich (he): that will

517
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:27.640
David Schaich (he): that to be left for you to

518
00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:32.230
David Schaich (he): I with that would be coming me run out of time

519
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:34.910
David Schaich (he): for today. Are there

520
00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:38.770
David Schaich (he): final questions before we wrap up

521
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.390
David Schaich (he): about

522
00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.750
David Schaich (he): either the simple conceptual

523
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:50.860
David Schaich (he): questions for this last activity, or the more substantial solution

524
00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.790
David Schaich (he): of the fully connected partition publishing.

525
00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:05.080
David Schaich (he): I don't see any. So we should

526
00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:10.100
David Schaich (he): good luck attempting that analysis.

527
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:12.540
David Schaich (he): and see you again

528
00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:24.530
David Schaich (he): again. Not Monday. Another rank holiday, but a Tuesday afternoon. Get back into more approximate solutions for easy model. A simple cubic lattice. something that

529
00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:30.460
David Schaich (he): cancel exactly depending on. Did you mention healthy.
