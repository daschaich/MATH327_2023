1
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.930
David Schaich (he): Okay, now that I think I've got everything loaded,

2
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.000
David Schaich (he): we can get underway with the tutorial for this week,

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.240
David Schaich (he): on the 20th of April.

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.700
And a

5
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.400
David Schaich (he): magic number that is

6
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.350
David Schaich (he): 6, 6, 9, 0, 6, 7.

7
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.990
David Schaich (he): The first thing to do, well the first thing to do is to fix the quality of that projector as best I can by hand.  We'll be zooming out in just a minute to look at some

8
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:51.100
David Schaich (he): prettier pictures. While that tries to focus itself, I'll check to see if you have it any questions about

9
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.800
David Schaich (he): what we've been doing since resuming, the homework that's due in a couple of weeks, or any other aspect of

10
00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.990
David Schaich (he): the module.

11
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:16.300
David Schaich (he): While you I think about that, I'll just say the plan for today is to quickly flash a couple of addenda to what we were discussing --- some things that came up

12
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.880
David Schaich (he): on Monday. I understand.

13
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.040
David Schaich (he): so something that

14
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.070
David Schaich (he): there is also something familiar with My!

15
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.910
David Schaich (he): We also elaborate on

16
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.250
David Schaich (he): wait. This part matter.

17
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:49.030
David Schaich (he): We use an imprint in the cosmic microwave. We looked at it on Monday, and then the

18
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.500
David Schaich (he): is yeah.

19
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.900
David Schaich (he): He has to be for solids in particular.

20
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.680
David Schaich (he): proposed by

21
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.340
David Schaich (he): Einstein and I. This report next. If we get to this.

22
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.700
David Schaich (he): hey. what collaboration also

23
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.210
David Schaich (he): on my side, and then to the 7 device. Several years after that.

24
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.240
David Schaich (he): with your last call for

25
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.900
David Schaich (he): questions, and i'll switch over to what I was

26
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:35.890
David Schaich (he): just loading in canvas. She is. It's a bit of visualization about the photon polarization that came up

27
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:46.850
David Schaich (he): the lecture on Monday. So i'll zoom in all the way to just get one of these animations on the screen at once. So I mentioned. You may already have

28
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.630
David Schaich (he): seen from previous work that

29
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.490
David Schaich (he): photons are related to electromagnetic fields.

30
00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.220
David Schaich (he): and particularly set of differential equations that cover the behavior of electromagnetic fields. Maxwell's equations

31
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:11.200
David Schaich (he): produce a relation between relations between the electric and magnetic parts of those fields. Our show here in red and blue

32
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.240
David Schaich (he): electric field oscillating

33
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.200
David Schaich (he): up and down along the Z. Axis

34
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:25.000
David Schaich (he): magnetic field oscillating left and right along the let's label the X-axis here. and

35
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.980
David Schaich (he): if we look at a particular point in the third axis, why.

36
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:38.280
David Schaich (he): we see, as time goes on. those electric field oscillations passing with the speed of light.

37
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.220
David Schaich (he): and they time between peaks related to the wavelength of that wave lambda.

38
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.770
David Schaich (he): So that is how waves are coming into the quantization of this behavior.

39
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.450
David Schaich (he): but the

40
00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.610
David Schaich (he): polarization that led to a doubling of all the degeneracies of the energy walls or photons

41
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:16.649
David Schaich (he): to the 2 ways that these electromagnetic fields can be arranged if they are still propagating in this direction, and visible with the same speed and wavelength to some observers sitting at a point on why.

42
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:23.020
David Schaich (he): So I mentioned. We have here the electric feeling the way up and down. Maybe it feel going left and right.

43
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.560
David Schaich (he): and also rotate that by 90 degrees, and the electric field, going left and right like the

44
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:41.940
David Schaich (he): blue colors here all the magnetic field that goes up and down. and that is an orthogonal linear combination of this electromagnetic wage that are propagating

45
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.120
David Schaich (he): in time.

46
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.360
David Schaich (he): That together account for those 2 polarizations.

47
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.670
David Schaich (he): What we can also do, and, what is more commonly done, is consider super positions of

48
00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:06.860
David Schaich (he): those 2 simple linear organizations up down, electric field versus left, right. electric field. And in particular it is time goes on. We adjust

49
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.330
David Schaich (he): the superposition that we have.

50
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.000
David Schaich (he): So the vector that's pointing here and going around in a circle

51
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.510
David Schaich (he): is

52
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.000
David Schaich (he): the choice that we can make of a superposition between vertically oriented electric fields

53
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.500
David Schaich (he): and horizontally oriented electric fields.

54
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.760
David Schaich (he): which is changing as time passes and produces a

55
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.710
David Schaich (he): different sort of pattern. But still, along where there are 2 distinct possibilities.

56
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.930
David Schaich (he): Yeah, either. Well.

57
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:48.510
David Schaich (he): the picture is worth a 1,000 words. Here you can see that the arrows are rotating in opposite directions on each of these 2 figures

58
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.950
David Schaich (he): that account for those 2 different

59
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.620
David Schaich (he): linear combinations

60
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.690
David Schaich (he): up the over.

61
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.170
It's all right.

62
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.760
David Schaich (he): Circular.

63
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.670
David Schaich (he): 2 of states that we have.

64
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.020
David Schaich (he): That's the right handed over.

65
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:28.300
David Schaich (he): Yes. it is. It's called the right hand Rule. where. if our figures in that out, the direction in which that there is negotiating.

66
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:36.320
David Schaich (he): that's one. Why, access to this label. That's the right hand organization.

67
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.680
David Schaich (he): Yeah. Ocean of the hotel

68
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.300
David Schaich (he): on your right hand, and we do the same with the

69
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.810
David Schaich (he): like that.

70
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.350
David Schaich (he): We also get that same direction from

71
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.690
David Schaich (he): rotation. So those are

72
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.980
David Schaich (he): some illustrations or visualizations of

73
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:06.510
David Schaich (he): the polarization States that contributed an overall factor of 2 to everything we were doing with the

74
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.380
David Schaich (he): at least

75
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:22.030
David Schaich (he): a factor of 2 to his grand canonical potential, and so cancelling out in the equation of state. but elaborating on that kind of background, if it's something you

76
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.240
David Schaich (he): haven't seen previously, and, as I said in those are

77
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.310
David Schaich (he): linked from the canvas page, and

78
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:35.130
David Schaich (he): the Wikipedia article. Mathematics. Behind those pictures is also

79
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.880
David Schaich (he): link to the

80
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.340
David Schaich (he): perhaps they are.

81
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.380
David Schaich (he): or less familiar

82
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:56.820
David Schaich (he): connection to the first time. Yeah. So we looked at on Monday came in connection to this picture of temperature fluctuations in cosmic microwave background

83
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:03.410
David Schaich (he): that I fly actually red areas on this map of the sky, and our

84
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.710
David Schaich (he): roughly 2 Villa Kelvins more than the blue areas.

85
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:22.200
David Schaich (he): the overall average temperature being about 2.7 kelvin. So 273 degrees Celsius below 0, and by it we have a few claims about this. There.

86
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.960
David Schaich (he): I hear you seem to be serious about further context.

87
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.560
David Schaich (he): First of all, they this pattern to

88
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.020
David Schaich (he): the big bank of the after global.

89
00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:35.610
David Schaich (he): the origin of the universe 14

90
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.150
David Schaich (he): 1 billionyears ago. This is

91
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.490
David Schaich (he): a another, a static visualization in this case. So

92
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:56.840
David Schaich (he): the evolution of the universe over those 14 billionyears which actually takes this picture of the Cm.

93
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:08.940
David Schaich (he): They will be after little light pattern coming from 375,000 years after the big bag. the very earliest point of the universe. And

94
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:14.920
David Schaich (he): what makes so 375,000 years after reality

95
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.760
14 billionis still 14 billion

96
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.100
David Schaich (he): hey? You

97
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:30.030
David Schaich (he): like. As we look back at further and further distances from where we are sitting. we are looking at light that has been traveling to us for longer and longer, eventually getting out

98
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.490
that 14 billion

99
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.770
David Schaich (he): light years away. And what is

100
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.390
David Schaich (he): remarkable about this copy of my great background

101
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:48.840
David Schaich (he): is that at earlier times, that first 375,000 years of the universe's existence. It was actually opaque is that high temperature plasma.

102
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.590
David Schaich (he): where electrons, protons, and neutrons were

103
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:53.760
David Schaich (he): all

104
00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:00.680
David Schaich (he): 3 particles passing off of each other. and now I would like to pass between them.

105
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.460
David Schaich (he): And this only adds the information

106
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:14.350
David Schaich (he): of this colleague microwave background that neutral atoms form and allow it to start traveling long distances, and eventually 14 billionlight years

107
00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.450
David Schaich (he): to our detectors.

108
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.190
David Schaich (he): So this cause my my early background is

109
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:27.620
David Schaich (he): essentially the earliest point in time that can possibly be seen using what

110
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.570
David Schaich (he): gravitational waves

111
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:34.800
David Schaich (he): can in principle see earlier times. They're at trickier as you work with than like.

112
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.650
David Schaich (he): And

113
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.290
the point I made about

114
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.150
David Schaich (he): the patterns of fluctuations in

115
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:50.270
David Schaich (he): this now college. the temperature of that Cmb. What is that?

116
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:57.250
David Schaich (he): The precise distribution of light and dark.

117
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:06.420
David Schaich (he): and this plot is related to what's the Not only is existence, but also it's

118
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.040
David Schaich (he): concentration, the amount of dark matter in the universe

119
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.400
David Schaich (he): that wouldn't go through

120
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.220
David Schaich (he): all to the more conceptual

121
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:30.420
David Schaich (he): picture of what is going on is looking at what's called a power spectrum. So it the correlations between

122
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:38.220
David Schaich (he): areas on this problem whether their temperature is fluctuating up or down. depending on the distance scale

123
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:47.890
David Schaich (he): between those points. So a distance on the cell that maps. The light sky onto a flat surface is an angle between 2.

124
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:57.100
David Schaich (he): So if you fix that angle, say 4.5 degrees, and look at all of the points that are separated by after the

125
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.570
David Schaich (he): the whole sky.

126
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.500
David Schaich (he): We get some

127
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.080
David Schaich (he): correlation function. See

128
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.440
David Schaich (he): as well.

129
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:15.570
David Schaich (he): is given my data points here from a succession of

130
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:22.040
David Schaich (he): with balloon and satellite experiments, the most recent one here is this.

131
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.100
David Schaich (he): a similar experiment that we have

132
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:41.100
David Schaich (he): not quite 20 years ago in 2,006. But there is a a clear pattern to the data that's coming out. A succession of

133
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.600
David Schaich (he): peaks in

134
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.350
David Schaich (he): the correlation between the temperature fluctuations separated by

135
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:53.480
David Schaich (he): different angular scales, different distances. the projected out onto this plane.

136
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.370
David Schaich (he): and

137
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:02.190
David Schaich (he): the mathematical calculation that we're not going to do, because this is not a cosmology module.

138
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:08.420
David Schaich (he): The term is the functional form. I would. How these data should behave

139
00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:19.180
David Schaich (he): just shows this red band on the wall of the very panel gray line as a fit to a function with 6 3 parameters.

140
00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.950
David Schaich (he): where those parameters are things like the total amount of matter in the universe

141
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:33.860
David Schaich (he): which controls things like the height of this very first. the scale of one degree angular separation.

142
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:43.080
David Schaich (he): Another parameter that comes in is the relative amount of dark matter

143
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.990
David Schaich (he): compared to order that actually interacts with

144
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.980
David Schaich (he): what we are looking at in this.

145
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:52.520
David Schaich (he): hey?

146
00:13:53.770 --> 00:14:05.100
David Schaich (he): I should have said that the horizontal axis here is plotting the same thing in 2 different ways, this angular scale, and you related to Hey, you multiple expansion there.

147
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:17.500
David Schaich (he): probably familiar with the first couple of and then higher and higher. smaller and smaller

148
00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.760
separations.

149
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.940
David Schaich (he): most of that

150
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.230
David Schaich (he): with that out of the way. And this third peak here

151
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:31.320
David Schaich (he): that it is sensitive to upon this

152
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:37.120
David Schaich (he): a direct matter compared to ordinary matter that interacts with what?

153
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.200
David Schaich (he): And just to

154
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.230
David Schaich (he): for the final

155
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.660
David Schaich (he): elaboration on Monday's lecture.

156
00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.930
David Schaich (he): This is a

157
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.910
David Schaich (he): slightly later on to you from

158
00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.970
David Schaich (he): 15 years ago, in 2,009,

159
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:10.700
David Schaich (he): and it's pl that same thing. that same access to multi whole moments, some angular separation

160
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:15.870
David Schaich (he): compared to that power spectrum with slightly different ranges of those axes.

161
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.600
David Schaich (he): What is

162
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.350
David Schaich (he): the reason I've gone with such old plots

163
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.740
David Schaich (he): is that this one

164
00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.100
David Schaich (he): that's the interesting comparison that

165
00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:39.080
David Schaich (he): it's kind of hold on the passion of this it fits. That calls me my way back from data from that the 2 different fit forms.

166
00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.420
David Schaich (he): So it's a solid black line, and they

167
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:50.550
David Schaich (he): that are essentially indistinguishable at that first.

168
00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:57.910
David Schaich (he): But you can see at that

169
00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.590
David Schaich (he): obviously data points much better. Yeah, they you.

170
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.840
David Schaich (he): So the top of same

171
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.230
David Schaich (he): analysis that we were looking at before this earlier plot

172
00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.050
David Schaich (he): what's called the

173
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:22.350
David Schaich (he): model of the Universe, which assumes

174
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:29.760
David Schaich (he): that there is some amount of dark matter, and the told about that there is is determined by the height of that through a peak.

175
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.870
David Schaich (he): The black Wall

176
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.120
David Schaich (he): is an alternative hypothesis that was

177
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:38.320
David Schaich (he): proposed

178
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:46.060
David Schaich (he): for some years that there actually isn't any dark matter. Gravity just works differently at very large scales.

179
00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.860
David Schaich (he): fractions of the entire universe. That

180
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:50.650
okay

181
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.510
David Schaich (he): checked out in the

182
00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.450
David Schaich (he): it's modified correctly

183
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.900
David Schaich (he): which it's. Basically We it out

184
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.990
David Schaich (he): 15 years ago by these sorts of analyses.

185
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:14.740
David Schaich (he): i'm looking at temperature relying on.

186
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.240
David Schaich (he): they're playing a spectrum for

187
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.800
David Schaich (he): the photon gas that we have going through. This

188
00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:27.460
David Schaich (he): is there? That's all I have to say about those

189
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.490
David Schaich (he): conductions between what we've been doing and

190
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:38.630
David Schaich (he): oh, that's more recent 20 first century research

191
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.720
David Schaich (he): there any questions about that before we return to

192
00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:49.210
David Schaich (he): talking about the Einstein solid and and heat capacities of materials.

193
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:05.310
David Schaich (he): So.

194
00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:15.360
David Schaich (he): getting back into this, this tutorial activity?

195
00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.010
David Schaich (he): Is this something we

196
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.330
David Schaich (he): briefly touched on

197
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:27.570
David Schaich (he): before the break. talking about this picture of

198
00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:32.000
David Schaich (he): So see Capacity that we actually flashed in. The very first lecture is

199
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.000
David Schaich (he): something that we will be able to

200
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.730
David Schaich (he): analyze based on

201
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.320
David Schaich (he): Do it. I don't know.

202
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.630
David Schaich (he): I recall correctly essentially all that

203
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:52.040
David Schaich (he): we had time to touch on that last.

204
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.260
David Schaich (he): The term break was.

205
00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.770
David Schaich (he): I'm sending you the task

206
00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:58.860
David Schaich (he): of

207
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:03.920
David Schaich (he): I can hear you these experimental heat capacities

208
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.620
David Schaich (he): to what the prediction we would get just from. And

209
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.900
David Schaich (he): nonetheless it is.

210
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:17.700
David Schaich (he): And I can't remember if I and that copies of that to

211
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.270
David Schaich (he): I heard you. It's a wall

212
00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:22.590
David Schaich (he): that is

213
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.590
Alright.

214
00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:31.100
David Schaich (he): all in Canada as usual. that way. You don't have to

215
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.940
David Schaich (he): a lot of screens here.

216
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.470
David Schaich (he): See what's going on.

217
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.520
David Schaich (he): bye. because this activity has been on canvas, for

218
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.930
David Schaich (he): they are her rules. Now

219
00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:56.010
David Schaich (he): you may well have spent some time during the break looking at that side which introduces hey here

220
00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.020
David Schaich (he): better way of analyzing solid materials

221
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:10.000
David Schaich (he): compared to it's just the simple spin system I talked about. and

222
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:15.720
David Schaich (he): several aspects graduate's module. It actually comes up again the home of assignments.

223
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:28.750
David Schaich (he): So I will make the assumption that you may all have check that out to you. But haven't that worked at

224
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.940
David Schaich (he): so I think the

225
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.520
David Schaich (he): model is something that we can

226
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.350
David Schaich (he): talk about and work through, or

227
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:42.960
David Schaich (he): the rest of today.

228
00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.380
David Schaich (he): and

229
00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.390
David Schaich (he): you can just jump straight to the

230
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:55.100
David Schaich (he): result, for that's been a system to see why and how it does not work.

231
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:03.290
David Schaich (he): I've assumed that. Go through the calculation yourself, and

232
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.220
David Schaich (he): we call it here

233
00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:13.690
David Schaich (he): heat, capacity at constant volume. It says derivative of the internal energy

234
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:16.410
David Schaich (he): with respect to the temperature.

235
00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:28.950
David Schaich (he): Yours What that you know here that the lines on here are that

236
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:35.200
David Schaich (he): the experimental measurement interaction, the heat, capacity measured, and it constant pressure, which is easier to do

237
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:40.250
David Schaich (he): experimentally further to do analysis. So we will

238
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.500
David Schaich (he): this treat those 2 types of people that these as equivalent.

239
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:50.430
David Schaich (he): So that is part of the reason for the the

240
00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:58.530
David Schaich (he): lines up here. But the calling the definition of that you can passively.

241
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:59.600
and

242
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:14.050
David Schaich (he): i'll quickly check. That's It's like the yeah average internal energy All 3 have It's what it costs to.

243
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.840
David Schaich (he): We have in.

244
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.940
David Schaich (he): She's obviously not what

245
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:22.040
David Schaich (he): is being measured experimentally.

246
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:28.040
David Schaich (he): and the it's been

247
00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.310
David Schaich (he): okay. So

248
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:34.870
David Schaich (he): yeah.

249
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.630
David Schaich (he): energy given my I of all the tangent that we derived

250
00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.020
David Schaich (he): me

251
00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.850
David Schaich (he): derivative of that you probably worked out

252
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.380
David Schaich (he): is

253
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:58.560
David Schaich (he): just derivative of that, with all the tangent is the

254
00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.950
David Schaich (he): inverse hyperbolic code tangent squared.

255
00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:03.930
David Schaich (he): So

256
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:15.440
David Schaich (he): there are a few aspects of this that are better. I think capacity. Both of these cases actually is not negative.

257
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:29.210
David Schaich (he): is the basic requirement that we have for it related to that fluctuation, dissipation, relation, the first on our assignment. The c. Capacity is equivalent to a

258
00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.630
David Schaich (he): Us. Expectation value of it.

259
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:38.100
David Schaich (he): no bigger number fluctuations around it. you

260
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.300
David Schaich (he): and

261
00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:44.900
David Schaich (he): the

262
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.890
David Schaich (he): low temperature

263
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.990
David Schaich (he): infinity, so as

264
00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:57.020
David Schaich (he): always a starting point for understanding the

265
00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:02.720
David Schaich (he): functions of temperature is to look at the high, low temperature with us. Yeah.

266
00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:07.290
David Schaich (he): cosine is e to the x plus the minus X, so that

267
00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.870
David Schaich (he): becomes approximately

268
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.620
David Schaich (he): square.

269
00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:27.170
David Schaich (he): A large number is enhanced contribution. This is also calling

270
00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.730
David Schaich (he): to infinity now exponentially

271
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:42.310
David Schaich (he): practice, you know, to 0 exponentially quickly. and the temperatures, which is at least

272
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:47.740
David Schaich (he): relatively consistent with the data that you see dropping down to

273
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.470
David Schaich (he): 0. And i'm sure it gets below 50 to 100

274
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.450
you're looking at.

275
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:56.280
David Schaich (he): so

276
00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.320
David Schaich (he): that you say check, mark in. I'll save

277
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:09.020
David Schaich (he): the heat capacity for any. I think we do.

278
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:10.120
The plasma

279
00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:13.380
David Schaich (he): does

280
00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.570
David Schaich (he): essentially always go to 0 in the low time as your limit. This is

281
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:30.170
David Schaich (he): related to the entry for you. Yes. he is. Sometimes, You see. there is a lot of thermodynamics

282
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:36.130
David Schaich (he): some of the same way that the entropy always increases

283
00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:40.110
David Schaich (he): always.

284
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.960
David Schaich (he): so that so far it seems so good

285
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.330
David Schaich (he): modeling salads as spins.

286
00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:49.340
David Schaich (he): but

287
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.620
David Schaich (he): high temperatures

288
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:55.520
it goes to

289
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.530
David Schaich (he): 0. The hyperbolic

290
00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:03.120
David Schaich (he): goes to one.

291
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.290
David Schaich (he): and we have

292
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.680
David Schaich (he): Beta square over. Essentially well.

293
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:16.610
David Schaich (he): 1, 2, 0 quadratically in that inverse temperature

294
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.850
David Schaich (he): which is not.

295
00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:24.060
David Schaich (he): I think, behavior, guys. you want to. We produce

296
00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.580
David Schaich (he): So, hopping over to

297
00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.110
David Schaich (he): notebook that I had set up just before we got started.

298
00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.100
David Schaich (he): we can take a look at

299
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.480
David Schaich (he): the full behavior of that

300
00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:49.440
David Schaich (he): Alpha Beta H. Squared over the coast, Hyperbolic cosine squared the age dividing by but the heat capacity by end to

301
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.310
David Schaich (he): get rid of that

302
00:26:51.750 --> 00:27:05.870
David Schaich (he): variable. So the full function in terms of Beta H. It's just like we analyze in the high in the temperature limits going to 0. In both cases a low temperature is a large Beta H.

303
00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:16.200
David Schaich (he): That is the exponential approach to 0. High temperature is a small mid h. That's the quadratic approach to 0, and maybe more convenient for comparison with

304
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:20.160
David Schaich (he): these data plotted against T rather than beta.

305
00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:24.010
David Schaich (he): just to switch all the X's to

306
00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.820
David Schaich (he): one over X's in that expression

307
00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:35.720
David Schaich (he): and plot things as a function of temperature rather than inverse temperature. So the exponentially

308
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.520
David Schaich (he): quickly crashing down to 0 at low temperatures.

309
00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.600
David Schaich (he): but then not approaching

310
00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:52.380
David Schaich (he): the roughly constant value that we want to monotonic increase as those. Now. what is that

311
00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.310
David Schaich (he): falling back down to 0 at high temperatures?

312
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:58.420
David Schaich (he): So

313
00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:08.940
David Schaich (he): that was. Take away your problem. We looked at before the break. And now

314
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.580
David Schaich (he): the

315
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.220
David Schaich (he): improvement on this is so.

316
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.040
David Schaich (he): This is a new problem. I'll read it

317
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:30.130
David Schaich (he): 20 years ago, and I this miracle of your proposed that energy was qualified to explain. It's called the total electric effect.

318
00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:33.720
David Schaich (he): Yeah. A couple of years after that

319
00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:40.510
David Schaich (he): you can apply that same idea of.

320
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.170
David Schaich (he): Still, with that

321
00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.300
David Schaich (he): have to introduce the

322
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:59.590
David Schaich (he): idea that the particles making up, and so they are interacting with each other, which makes all of the

323
00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:02.860
David Schaich (he): calculations much more complicated than Zoom will see here

324
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:03.850
here

325
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:05.300
David Schaich (he): a few weeks.

326
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:10.940
David Schaich (he): So the I science approach I mean picture that

327
00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:20.310
David Schaich (he): the all right. fixed in place by interacting

328
00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.480
David Schaich (he): with their neighbors.

329
00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:31.630
David Schaich (he): because those interactions are hard to analyze

330
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.000
David Schaich (he): mathematically.

331
00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:36.480
David Schaich (he): Instead of

332
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.740
David Schaich (he): this, interaction

333
00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.510
David Schaich (he): leads to the energy of the solid

334
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:50.130
David Schaich (he): can be identified with

335
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.380
David Schaich (he): so called oscillators

336
00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:03.080
David Schaich (he): that we're connecting the ads rather than they have themselves. So

337
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.800
David Schaich (he): this is the picture they have in the

338
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:06.710
David Schaich (he): for you

339
00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:15.770
David Schaich (he): shaded circles on the atoms and assembly. They're connected by these. Yes.

340
00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:25.990
David Schaich (he): and each other is connected to some number of it's, neighbors by these oscillators in a regular pattern. This is a

341
00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.730
David Schaich (he): 2 dimensional square lattice. I,

342
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:34.510
David Schaich (he): the simplest possible model of this

343
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:39.750
David Schaich (he): quantized energy levels

344
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.390
David Schaich (he): the oscillators.

345
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.400
David Schaich (he): which could have

346
00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:58.090
David Schaich (he): 2 units, and

347
00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:03.670
David Schaich (he): so on to arbitrarily high energies just ending on

348
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.440
David Schaich (he): how fully those oscillators are heading to

349
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:12.630
David Schaich (he): your location in this all?

350
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.280
David Schaich (he): So okay.

351
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:25.040
David Schaich (he): micro economical approach. yeah to where we started with this module.

352
00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.450
David Schaich (he): we can

353
00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:35.660
David Schaich (he): suppose we are working with a solid, a fixed number of oscillators. That's

354
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.460
David Schaich (he): number of adults which share

355
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.660
David Schaich (he): some fixed amount of energy that comes with more of

356
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:47.320
David Schaich (he): Hey

357
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.750
David Schaich (he): you this

358
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:56.180
David Schaich (he): there it is, K. It's just the

359
00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:01.870
David Schaich (he): some of the energy in each of those and oscillators

360
00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.540
David Schaich (he): which itself is

361
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.010
David Schaich (he): it shouldn't

362
00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:11.280
David Schaich (he): energy? Here.

363
00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.980
David Schaich (he): K. Is some of the number of energy that's the energy itself.

364
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:18.490
David Schaich (he): It is

365
00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:22.810
David Schaich (he): some over all the oscillators in K times

366
00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.360
David Schaich (he): that.

367
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:35.300
David Schaich (he): So if we want to find the heat capacity for the small

368
00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:44.520
David Schaich (he): ensemble. there are a few steps to go through first. My name I for sure

369
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.240
David Schaich (he): related to

370
00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.330
one of them

371
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:56.180
David Schaich (he): of the number of microstates for and oscillators with K.

372
00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:03.940
David Schaich (he): Then we invert that to find

373
00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.790
David Schaich (he): yeah as a

374
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:11.330
for the

375
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:16.060
David Schaich (he): and then, finally. hey to you? Can we have it

376
00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:23.560
David Schaich (he): to get the heat capacity? So

377
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:29.540
David Schaich (he): that is the task that's laid out in all the

378
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.680
David Schaich (he): that first results will give you some time to work on that

379
00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:35.340
David Schaich (he): check in with

380
00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:38.360
the first point at the end of today

381
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.640
David Schaich (he): getting that total number of microstates, and

382
00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:47.830
David Schaich (he): that these into the infrastructure

383
00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.860
David Schaich (he): you can check, I guess.

384
00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:57.210
David Schaich (he): the simplest possible setup. It is not trivial

385
00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.740
David Schaich (he): with just 3 oscillators

386
00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:08.340
David Schaich (he): that are connected 3 atoms and sharing some small amounts of energy

387
00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:14.780
David Schaich (he): 0 1 2, or 3 units divided above those 3 oscillators possible ways.

388
00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:16.710
David Schaich (he): How many questions about

389
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:21.550
David Schaich (he): the picture of the solid, or

390
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:23.710
David Schaich (he): how to

391
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:27.469
David Schaich (he): approach the determination of the capacity.

392
00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:36.570
David Schaich (he): you know.

393
00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:43.429
David Schaich (he): Recording it lets you. you know, with some of these calculations yourselves.

394
00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.620
David Schaich (he): maybe yeah.

395
00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:03.820
David Schaich (he): 3.2. Check anybody. Somebody first steps.

396
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.050
David Schaich (he): That

397
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.210
David Schaich (he): easy thing to look at is just that

398
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.800
David Schaich (he): minimal case of

399
00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.470
David Schaich (he): n equals 3

400
00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.250
David Schaich (he): oscillators with

401
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:37.450
David Schaich (he): some total number of energy. Us. So if we have no energy at all in the system, then there's an area simple counting of microstates.

402
00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:44.730
David Schaich (he): One of the 3 oscillators has any units of energy.

403
00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:51.140
David Schaich (he): Contrast that with energy it couldn't be in

404
00:35:51.620 --> 00:36:01.700
David Schaich (he): any one of those 3 oscillators, each of those situations to files the different microstates

405
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.110
David Schaich (he): like this, the energy that oscillator or the third oscillator.

406
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.050
David Schaich (he): This is actually the same that we we had for

407
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.580
David Schaich (he): just a

408
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.470
David Schaich (he): set of.

409
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:29.350
David Schaich (he): I just fixed a lot of energy. So so far. Okay, I just It's been system that things become more interesting when there are 2

410
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:43.410
David Schaich (he): is that there are 2 ways we can to find those up among different oscillators. In contrast to the spin system. where at some point it starts.

411
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:56.000
David Schaich (he): i'm buying out of here. Each of these oscillators can now have 0. One or 2 units. There are 3 ways to have

412
00:36:56.150 --> 00:37:00.090
David Schaich (he): the total amount of energy in each one of those 3 operators.

413
00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:10.350
David Schaich (he): and there are also a few ways to split the 2 units of energy among different oscillators. So say you have 1 min there.

414
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:12.290
there, you there!

415
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.700
David Schaich (he): Oh, well. 0 1

416
00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:16.250
David Schaich (he): or 0 1.

417
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:16.950
Well

418
00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:19.010
David Schaich (he): so

419
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.350
David Schaich (he): toll over viruses. There is now 6.

420
00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.690
David Schaich (he): You're getting it so interesting

421
00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:28.110
David Schaich (he): behavior that was not possible.

422
00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.990
David Schaich (he): It's been system. We started off with even more. So for

423
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:42.820
David Schaich (he): 3 years better. Here we have that same 3 ways of having all 3 min in a single oscillator. You can also stood up into

424
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:52.780
David Schaich (he): 2 and one oscillator, one in the second oscillator and 0, and the third oscillator. If we count all the possibilities

425
00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.250
David Schaich (he): there are.

426
00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:04.200
David Schaich (he): choose any one of the 3 or the 2 units, then we have 2 left to choose for the one that is

427
00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:13.850
David Schaich (he): so, 3 factorial 6. And then finally, we can have 1, one in all 3 oscillators getting a total

428
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.800
10,

429
00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:22.490
David Schaich (he): and I will just give you a target, for

430
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.900
David Schaich (he): there you go.

431
00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:31.110
David Schaich (he): a full expression that you may already have derived or can

432
00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:33.960
David Schaich (he): in for if not.

433
00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.740
David Schaich (he): yeah. full expression is.

434
00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:45.980
David Schaich (he): hey plus and minus one factorial. divided by K Factorial.

435
00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:50.080
David Schaich (he): the minus one factorial or

436
00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.860
David Schaich (he): one choose K.

437
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.580
And

438
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:03.220
David Schaich (he): if you got it yes. drive that it gets you something more.

439
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:06.360
David Schaich (he): I'll create 2 shoot, 4 in the coming week.

440
00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:14.020
David Schaich (he): and if you have difficulties with it. You can go through the derivation next Thursday.

441
00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:19.020
David Schaich (he): and do the usual

442
00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:22.890
David Schaich (he): specific use in a more straightforward way.

443
00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:30.840
David Schaich (he): So the last call for

444
00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.670
David Schaich (he): questions about that otherwise we need to

445
00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:38.110
David Schaich (he): play with this. So Einstein

446
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:44.010
David Schaich (he): probably do something even clever. That device something that

447
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:45.600
next Thursday.
