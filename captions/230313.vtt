1
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.280
David Schaich (he): Well, given the time, I think we should get under way.  Though I see

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.360
David Schaich (he): more folks have gotten into the habit of

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.930
David Schaich (he): joining remotely on the Monday mornings. It is a bit wet today, even though it's

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.860
David Schaich (he): warmed up quite a bit from all the snow last week. So let's going with that magic number for today:

5
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.610
David Schaich (he): 6, 8, 5,

6
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.320
David Schaich (he): 1, 9, 2.

7
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.770
David Schaich (he): And we are at the start of the seventh week in the term, so the halfway point, and

8
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:49.700
David Schaich (he): just about halfway through the material for this module as well. We've had a bit of a mix of

9
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.260
David Schaich (he): statistical physics foundations and applications

10
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.880
David Schaich (he): up until now. The second half is going to be a bit

11
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.920
David Schaich (he): more foundation, but a greater proportion of application.

12
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.010
David Schaich (he): Just to

13
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.730
David Schaich (he): check in on where we are from last week,

14
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.760
David Schaich (he): we have built up

15
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.960
David Schaich (he): from probability foundations to the concept of

16
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.560
David Schaich (he): statistical ensembles, in the particular, the canonical ensemble

17
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.710
David Schaich (he): partition function that is the

18
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.570
David Schaich (he): starting point for the chemical ensemble. We have

19
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.830
David Schaich (he): derive the behavior

20
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:44.850
David Schaich (he): of ideal gases. and started to look at putting those ideal gases to work to

21
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.820
David Schaich (he): fine

22
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.380
David Schaich (he): engines and refrigerators

23
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.000
David Schaich (he): based on thermodynamic cycles.

24
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.630
David Schaich (he): What we have derived a few key equations. Yeah.

25
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.990
David Schaich (he): Average internal energy of an ideal gas in the economical ensemble

26
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:24.320
David Schaich (he): directly proportional to the temperature. We've derived that the entropy. It's proportional to the volume of the gas I see. or he has covered this temperature.

27
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:37.720
David Schaich (he): We derived the ideal gas law that you may well have seen before the Pressure Times. The volume of the gas is the number of particles in it multiplied by the temperature. and a

28
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:52.880
David Schaich (he): generalized form of the first law of thermodynamics that any change. the average internal energy of the gas has to be due to some flow of either heats queue

29
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.350
David Schaich (he): between the gas and the surroundings for work that is done on the gas by the surroundings.

30
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.590
David Schaich (he): and we

31
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.140
David Schaich (he): wrapped up last week by defining

32
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.550
David Schaich (he): so called pressure voice

33
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:25.240
David Schaich (he): diagrams. That's a line provide a useful way to capture the macro stage or thermodynamic states of these systems.

34
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.730
David Schaich (he): and in particular

35
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.760
David Schaich (he): capture what happens that macro state is, we carry out

36
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.210
David Schaich (he): processes and then change some of these thermodynamic quantities, pressure, volume, temperature, internal energy.

37
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.910
David Schaich (he): So are there any questions about that before we

38
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.950
David Schaich (he): dive into using these

39
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.040
David Schaich (he): as a tool

40
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.820
David Schaich (he): to analyze thermodynamic cycles and see how we can get

41
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.340
David Schaich (he): work out with them.

42
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.610
David Schaich (he): So that is essentially the plan for today is

43
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.910
David Schaich (he): going through in detail

44
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.030
David Schaich (he): these analyses.

45
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.600
David Schaich (he): based on pressure volume diagrams where we saw last week that

46
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.899
David Schaich (he): a given

47
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.720
David Schaich (he): state is defined. Thanks to these 4 equations, the pressure and the volume

48
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.460
David Schaich (he): determine every other aspect of that macroscopic from the dynamic state.

49
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.840
David Schaich (he): So it point on the Heb diagram

50
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.240
David Schaich (he): specified by a certain value

51
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.690
David Schaich (he): of the pressure and the bullying

52
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.990
David Schaich (he): gives us the temperature of the internal energy and the entropy.

53
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.520
David Schaich (he): and if we

54
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.720
David Schaich (he): change that state through a thermodynamic process.

55
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.360
David Schaich (he): you end up with a line.

56
00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.690
David Schaich (he): And finally, if we stitch together a sequence of these processes that form a closed path

57
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.080
David Schaich (he): in the diagram

58
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.440
David Schaich (he): that defines

59
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:14.810
David Schaich (he): a through a dynamic cycle that can be repeated over and over again. always getting back to its initial starting macro state.

60
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.900
David Schaich (he): thanks to exchanging

61
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.470
David Schaich (he): energy, either the form of heat or work with its surroundings. So 2

62
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.320
David Schaich (he): go through an explicit

63
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.300
David Schaich (he): example of how this works. let's consider

64
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.050
David Schaich (he): isothermal expansion

65
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.520
David Schaich (he): of the gas, which i'll remind you I temperature is

66
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.710
David Schaich (he): fixed, which requires that the

67
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.820
David Schaich (he): process be slow, so that all possible heat exchange

68
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.440
David Schaich (he): as an opportunity to be carried out.

69
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.550
David Schaich (he): and for expanding

70
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:07.400
David Schaich (he): the system from this initial volume V 0 to some larger volume. The F. We want to figure out what happens to

71
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.360
David Schaich (he): the other quantities.

72
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:15.580
David Schaich (he): You've been a fixed temperature. and maybe something that you can consider as we go through. This is

73
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:22.260
David Schaich (he): which direction he will be exchanged as we expand the system is it's going to

74
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.690
David Schaich (he): want to heat up, and we'll have to exchange sheets by pushing it out

75
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.620
David Schaich (he): as wasted into its surroundings.

76
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.490
David Schaich (he): or whether it want to cool down and have to bring in additional heat

77
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.500
David Schaich (he): from the reservoir. In order to maintain this fixed temperature.

78
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.720
David Schaich (he): we will see the answer to that. But to begin with, we can

79
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.370
David Schaich (he): combine this condition of an isothermal, fixed temperature with

80
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:56.570
David Schaich (he): the ideal gas and all that gives us the relation between

81
00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.750
David Schaich (he): initial pressure and volume.

82
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.940
David Schaich (he): the final pressure for you.

83
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.130
David Schaich (he): which, if we solve for that final pressure.

84
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.780
David Schaich (he): we immediately get that

85
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:25.370
David Schaich (he): this cancelling out. those ends moving. the final going to the other side. you get the initial Pressure Times. This ratio

86
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.670
David Schaich (he): of initial and final volume. Since the final volume is larger, this is smaller.

87
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.480
David Schaich (he): the initial pressure, so we can draw the line that corresponds to this process

88
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.870
David Schaich (he): small final pressure.

89
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.290
David Schaich (he): Then we started off with

90
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.280
David Schaich (he): so the overall change in pressure

91
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.410
David Schaich (he): that we have final pressure minus the initial one.

92
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:53.740
David Schaich (he): It's just

93
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.080
David Schaich (he): proportional to the initial pressure

94
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:07.260
David Schaich (he): times. The difference between this ratio of 0 over B up on this one.

95
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.500
David Schaich (he): which is less than 0.

96
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.810
David Schaich (he): So.

97
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.610
David Schaich (he): given this form of the process. It's not obvious

98
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.980
David Schaich (he): which direction the temperature would want to go. But

99
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:27.350
David Schaich (he): while the volume is increasing, the pressure is decreasing, so it's keep

100
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.910
David Schaich (he): the temperature fixed.

101
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.429
David Schaich (he): The process that is sketched out in this way.

102
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.240
David Schaich (he): Let's see name of an Iso.

103
00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:47.910
David Schaich (he): So the line on the Pv diagram or responding to isothermal either expansion in this case or

104
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.910
David Schaich (he): impression. If we were to go the other way and end up with a smaller

105
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.860
David Schaich (he): volume, then we started off with.

106
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:09.340
David Schaich (he): if we recall that the energies, the individual microstates that we're our starting point, the partition function from which we've derived everything else for the past couple of weeks.

107
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.820
David Schaich (he): Those

108
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.970
David Schaich (he): we're proportional to this

109
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:28.760
David Schaich (he): has a factor of h bar squared pi squared over 2 times. The mass of the particles times l squared elsewhere is before you the two-thirds power. So, and it's. The volume increases

110
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:39.420
David Schaich (he): in this expansion. We expect the energy of every microstate to decrease uniformly due to this dependence on the volume.

111
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.460
David Schaich (he): and since that energy is just

112
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.740
David Schaich (he): directly proportional to the temperature

113
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:53.440
David Schaich (he): that would decrease if there were no heat exchange. So therefore. you know that to you.

114
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.400
David Schaich (he): Heat exchange that occurs

115
00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:05.710
David Schaich (he): in this is the from. The expansion has to come into the system from its reservoir, in order to keep the temperature fixed

116
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.640
David Schaich (he): when it would.

117
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.810
David Schaich (he): if left to itself, want to decrease due to the larger volume.

118
00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.170
David Schaich (he): So it is

119
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:22.240
David Schaich (he): there any questions or objections about that kind of argumentation.

120
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.460
David Schaich (he): I'm seeing any. Let's more quickly go through.

121
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.280
David Schaich (he): Oh, consider! Before we move on.

122
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:43.250
David Schaich (he): One question is. what would it mean if 2 of these isotherms and a Pv diagram where to cross. Well.

123
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.580
David Schaich (he): I mean

124
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.230
David Schaich (he): our starting point for these diagrams is that each point

125
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:03.490
David Schaich (he): fixes the pressure volume, and from them every other macroscopic on the date.

126
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:09.730
David Schaich (he): and in particular. when, if 2 Iso terms were the cross, they would have

127
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.950
David Schaich (he): same pressure and volume. If we divide that by end

128
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:23.220
David Schaich (he): we get the they correspond to the same temperature, and since the temperature is fixed on an isotherm

129
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.750
in addition.

130
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.010
David Schaich (he): the only way that 2 of these isotherms can cross

131
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.220
David Schaich (he): in a TV diagram is, if they are in fact.

132
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.190
David Schaich (he): very same iso term.

133
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.570
David Schaich (he): So if there are different iso firms at fixed different temperatures.

134
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.170
David Schaich (he): they will be these parallel curves

135
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.810
David Schaich (he): that this functional form of one over

136
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.170
David Schaich (he): so we can all that

137
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.940
David Schaich (he): like. So

138
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:10.060
David Schaich (he): I have say one. This is something like that second place of through that is

139
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.200
David Schaich (he): parallel to it as best I can

140
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.030
David Schaich (he): draw this

141
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.680
David Schaich (he): and

142
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.190
David Schaich (he): the question now. So

143
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.670
David Schaich (he): you say, yeah.

144
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.970
David Schaich (he): you have 2 different temperatures.

145
00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.060
David Schaich (he): A. With

146
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.440
David Schaich (he): What is a process that will take us from one of these iso terms

147
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.090
David Schaich (he): to the next, something that has to rise

148
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.670
David Schaich (he): more steeply.

149
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.620
David Schaich (he): Then these fixed temperature curves.

150
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.330
David Schaich (he): What this gives us is

151
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:54.090
David Schaich (he): a second example to consider, and just to switch things up.

152
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:09.830
David Schaich (he): changed from expansion to compressions, are going from a larger initial board to a smaller.

153
00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.030
David Schaich (he): and you

154
00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.260
David Schaich (he): specifying that this will correspond to

155
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:21.390
David Schaich (he): the

156
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.400
David Schaich (he): opposite extreme of idiomatic

157
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:34.540
David Schaich (he): impression. So whereas isothermal compression was slow, so that all possible to the exchange could take place and keep the temperature fixed.

158
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:40.360
David Schaich (he): If you had a compression, it's fast so that no heat exchange occurs.

159
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:48.750
David Schaich (he): so the amount of heat that flows into rather than the system is 0. And since this is

160
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.630
David Schaich (he): given by the temperature times, the change

161
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.430
David Schaich (he): in the entropy.

162
00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.180
David Schaich (he): we know that the and for P. You

163
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.080
David Schaich (he): it is kept constant, and we can bring to their

164
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:08.460
David Schaich (he): a condition of Council of Entropy another one of those key equations that we derived from the canonical partition function

165
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.920
David Schaich (he): importantly, that change in the energy.

166
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.500
David Schaich (he): Also.

167
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.750
David Schaich (he): there's a company by the change in the temperature connecting

168
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.940
David Schaich (he): it was too parallel

169
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.800
David Schaich (he): isotherms.

170
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.190
David Schaich (he): and we can't compute

171
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:38.360
David Schaich (he): that change in the temperature as well as the change in the pressure

172
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:46.700
David Schaich (he): from that condition of constant entropy. So the volume times the free hash power of the temperature

173
00:14:50.920 --> 00:15:02.430
David Schaich (he): has to stay fixed throughout the sole process. It's the same at the beginning and the end. so we arrange in gives us the final temperature. which is

174
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.260
David Schaich (he): the same ratio of

175
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.400
David Schaich (he): That's the initial point you. since the initial volume.

176
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.680
David Schaich (he): because now the larger one is

177
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.400
David Schaich (he): is a factor that is greater than one

178
00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:18.650
to

179
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:23.810
David Schaich (he): okay, another way. The change in for sure.

180
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.190
David Schaich (he): Here's

181
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.800
David Schaich (he): a volume ratio. So it's you through is power minus one.

182
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.620
David Schaich (he): I said. Initial temperature, you can buy it.

183
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.720
David Schaich (he): the initial pressure going in and particle number.

184
00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.370
David Schaich (he): So a positive change in temperature.

185
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:55.820
David Schaich (he): So the isotherm. Why, above the initial one has a larger temperature, which is not too surprising, but not guaranteed

186
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.590
David Schaich (he): a priori. Say it result that we have

187
00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.060
David Schaich (he): derived from this

188
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.410
David Schaich (he): simple calculation. And now having both the

189
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:13.150
David Schaich (he): or having a connection between that initial and final temperature. We can't use the equation of states, the ideal gas law

190
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:17.960
David Schaich (he): to compute the changing the pressure just like we did, for

191
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.190
David Schaich (he): in case of an Iso firm.

192
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.400
David Schaich (he): so

193
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.890
David Schaich (he): plugging in the expression for this temperature from

194
00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.900
David Schaich (he): the ideal gas, well, Pb equals nt

195
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.490
David Schaich (he): we have

196
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:44.530
David Schaich (he): that the initial temperature was he not to be not over and

197
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:57.380
David Schaich (he): go ahead. Take the two-thirds power of both sides to isolate the quality that we are now interested in the final pressure.

198
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:07.310
David Schaich (he): Anything cancel off on both sides and rearranging. We just find out the final pressure is

199
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:12.950
David Schaich (he): the ratio of volumes to the one plus 2 thirds, is

200
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.740
David Schaich (he): 5 thirds power.

201
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.450
David Schaich (he): and changing pressure, then

202
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.960
David Schaich (he): looks very much like the change in temperature.

203
00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.590
David Schaich (he): just with a different power on that volume ratio.

204
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.390
David Schaich (he): and as we drew here

205
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:44.000
David Schaich (he): the pressure that increases as we compress

206
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:48.940
David Schaich (he): and increases even more quickly than the temperature does.

207
00:17:51.090 --> 00:18:04.390
David Schaich (he): So those are a couple of examples of thermodynamic processes in TV diagrams. The 2 extremes of isothermal and idiotic expansion that you mentioned that

208
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:16.910
David Schaich (he): this line here. It's cost of entropy. It's no, it's an 80, or that. And analogy with Iso that we had for the awesome temperature case.

209
00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.960
David Schaich (he): There's that visible for you.

210
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.580
David Schaich (he): and there are, of course.

211
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:29.270
David Schaich (he): difference processes that we could consider, doing, say, fixing the volume

212
00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:33.270
David Schaich (he): and pouring in heat to raise the temperature and pressure

213
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:40.850
David Schaich (he): the other way of extracting heat. imposing a constant force, so that the pressure is constant or the volume of the temperature change.

214
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:45.940
David Schaich (he): But just the extremes of the isotherm and any of that

215
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.680
David Schaich (he): will suffice to

216
00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:56.140
David Schaich (he): to fall in a famous thermodynamic cycle. So, putting 4 of these processes

217
00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:01.600
David Schaich (he): together in this particular sequence.

218
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.850
David Schaich (he): so if we say we, starting from point, a yeah

219
00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:15.570
David Schaich (he): demand will be be clear. That's point a is.

220
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:20.880
David Schaich (he): and a high temperature, Th

221
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.830
David Schaich (he): that is set by thermal contact with

222
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:29.220
David Schaich (he): a hot external reservoir. We

223
00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:38.800
David Schaich (he): carry out a stage of isothermal expansion to this point B. And so, following, increasing from Va.

224
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.690
David Schaich (he): The Vp. Along and Isotherm.

225
00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.920
David Schaich (he): and then

226
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.750
David Schaich (he): carry out an additional stage of fast expansion

227
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:55.240
David Schaich (he): that freezes the entropy does not allow any heat to be exchanged.

228
00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:02.090
David Schaich (he): and gives us this idea that from point B to point, c. That leaves us at a lower temperature

229
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.800
David Schaich (he): that we can

230
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:15.760
David Schaich (he): appreciate or understand, as the system now being in thermal contact with a different external reservoir that has a colder temperature

231
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.570
David Schaich (he): T. L. For t level.

232
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:26.060
David Schaich (he): and then at that point, c. We simply repeat the process, carry out some slow isothermal compression.

233
00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:27.660
David Schaich (he): Now to Point D,

234
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.350
David Schaich (he): and then the second stage of fast idiomatic compression.

235
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:35.740
David Schaich (he): to get back to exactly the same macro state that we started off with

236
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.170
David Schaich (he): at point a so this

237
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.890
David Schaich (he): particular through the hemic cycle is

238
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:55.440
David Schaich (he): notice the Carnot cycle, named after French engineer, Saudi Carnot, who proposed it in

239
00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:00.300
David Schaich (he): 1824, which, if you remember the re historical, aside

240
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:10.580
David Schaich (he): from last week, was actually before things like the ideal gas law had been written down, or wasn't derived from statistical physics.

241
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.070
David Schaich (he): So. It was very much a

242
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:18.360
David Schaich (he): inspired construction on his part to

243
00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.910
David Schaich (he): figure out that these

244
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:28.950
David Schaich (he): various sorts of processes, isothermal and Adiabatic expansion and compression arranged in this way

245
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.550
David Schaich (he): could be used to

246
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:37.850
David Schaich (he): could be put together into this closed path around the pressure volume, diagram, getting back to the initial state.

247
00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.520
David Schaich (he): and in particular, as we will see.

248
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:48.680
David Schaich (he): And thanks to going around this path. this provides a way for

249
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:57.020
David Schaich (he): our ideal gas to actually do work on the surroundings by moving heat between those 2 reservoirs, the hop

250
00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:03.530
David Schaich (he): reservoir. the cold rest of these 2 different temperatures. just to reiterate

251
00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:05.360
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

252
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.050
David Schaich (he): 4 stages here.

253
00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.290
David Schaich (he): maybe a more physical.

254
00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:18.010
David Schaich (he): We're looking at things rather than the kind of abstract pressure, holding diagram

255
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.210
David Schaich (he): as we go around from

256
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:30.300
David Schaich (he): Point a to B C, D. And then back to a. We start off with

257
00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:33.890
David Schaich (he): the slow isothermal expansion

258
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.550
David Schaich (he): that takes heat in

259
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:37.550
David Schaich (he): from

260
00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:43.380
David Schaich (he): the hot reservoir which here is being drawn to the right of our ideal gas system.

261
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:53.240
David Schaich (he): So the idea it's being illustrated by the insulation on

262
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:57.310
David Schaich (he): this side of the ideal gas is that this is

263
00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.840
David Schaich (he): connection with that hot, external reservoir

264
00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:07.380
David Schaich (he): on the right hand side that allows heat to flow in during that slow expansion which we then change

265
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.110
David Schaich (he): you fast. Adiabatic expansion, with no heat. Exchange

266
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:12.980
David Schaich (he): procedures. B to C.

267
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.810
David Schaich (he): That takes us down to Hey, You

268
00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:22.850
David Schaich (he): cold temperature, bad will be fixed by

269
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:32.310
David Schaich (he): a different external reservoir here drawn to the left of the system. whereas we go through the slow isothermal compression stage

270
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.930
David Schaich (he): fixes the temperature at T out by expelling waste

271
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:49.460
David Schaich (he): That's cold reservoir on the left. and then, finally the final stage of fast Adiabatic expansion. Sorry you got a compression

272
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.630
David Schaich (he): to get back to that starting point a.

273
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.900
David Schaich (he): And the question to

274
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.770
one question to ask about

275
00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.010
David Schaich (he): this cargo cycle

276
00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.450
David Schaich (he): is

277
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:14.300
David Schaich (he): whether it is self-consistent. whether it is possible in principle to put together these

278
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:20.850
David Schaich (he): 4 stages in such a way that we do, in fact, get back to the starting point, and can repeat the cycle

279
00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:24.620
David Schaich (he): an arbitrary number of times 2

280
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:34.710
David Schaich (he): How to do the work that we want. So the key idea is that we have ideal gas connected

281
00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.300
David Schaich (he): to 2 external reservoirs.

282
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:48.700
David Schaich (he): which is hot with a high temperature, th you know, which is cool. That low temperature. Tl

283
00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.090
David Schaich (he): I think i'm not giving away anything when I tell you that

284
00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:06.520
David Schaich (he): the answer to this question is that yes, the car no cycle isn't, he self-consistent.

285
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.400
David Schaich (he): This is

286
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:19.370
David Schaich (he): something that this is a general question that can be asked of any set of processes going around It's pressure volume diagram, so useful to

287
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:28.770
David Schaich (he): go through the exercise of verifying this for a case where we know everything should work out. and then

288
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.030
David Schaich (he): we will have that experience. These tools available

289
00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:35.230
David Schaich (he): for it

290
00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:42.080
David Schaich (he): other sorts of more general cycles, where the answer is not quite so obvious.

291
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.210
David Schaich (he): So.

292
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:47.840
David Schaich (he): looking back at the

293
00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:52.560
David Schaich (he): part of the cycle which I won't bother redrawing. Since I have this illustration.

294
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:53.740
David Schaich (he): print it out.

295
00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.360
David Schaich (he): we can imagine that we

296
00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:04.360
David Schaich (he): have freedom to define the certain position of this initial state

297
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:08.380
David Schaich (he): of the cycle at Point a. It's given

298
00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:14.080
David Schaich (he): the number of particles in the gas and the pressure and volume that we can choose in the starting point.

299
00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:21.540
David Schaich (he): And then you're also free to decide how long you do that isothermal expansion.

300
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.620
David Schaich (he): or you know.

301
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:31.610
David Schaich (he): in other words, at what Boeing dB: we switch over from isothermal expansion to it the panic expansion

302
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.410
David Schaich (he): as well as the volume.

303
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:38.490
David Schaich (he): Do you see it which we stop expanding altogether and start compressing

304
00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.010
David Schaich (he): at this point?

305
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.950
David Schaich (he): But we don't have any freedom.

306
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.720
David Schaich (he): Excuse me longer is this volume

307
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.380
David Schaich (he): that's will have to be

308
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.030
David Schaich (he): fixed to the

309
00:26:55.110 --> 00:27:03.170
David Schaich (he): particular correct value in order for the combination of isothermal and Adiabatic compression to get us back to the starting point.

310
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.770
David Schaich (he): and it will also turn out to that.

311
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.100
David Schaich (he): The

312
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:17.900
David Schaich (he): combinations of pressure and volume, as we said, are determining the high and low temperatures

313
00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:30.530
David Schaich (he): in case of the high temperature is just PA Times B a. Over N. From the ideal gas law. So given these experimental inputs that we imagine we have control over.

314
00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.000
David Schaich (he): You want to

315
00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.020
David Schaich (he): find the correct

316
00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:46.340
David Schaich (he): value of that volume that allows the cycle to close and be repeated. And in the process of doing so we will see that

317
00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.620
David Schaich (he): such a volume does in fact, exist.

318
00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:55.410
David Schaich (he): That is the resolve. It may not be guaranteed for

319
00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.120
David Schaich (he): the more general dynamic cycle.

320
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.450
David Schaich (he): So given

321
00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.550
David Schaich (he): the initial state.

322
00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:12.890
David Schaich (he): the a. yeah, and the fixed number of particles.

323
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.420
David Schaich (he): plus a choice of how far to we expand is so

324
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:22.540
David Schaich (he): and adiabatically

325
00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.090
David Schaich (he): to show the consistency of the cycle.

326
00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:29.350
David Schaich (he): we have to find.

327
00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.130
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

328
00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:38.470
David Schaich (he): one correct value of the

329
00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:44.330
David Schaich (he): with the compression changes from

330
00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.090
David Schaich (he): isothermal to

331
00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:54.600
David Schaich (he): so we do this by going around the cycle

332
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.860
David Schaich (he): and determining all of the

333
00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.660
David Schaich (he): properties of the

334
00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:10.540
David Schaich (he): Macro States that have not been specified by our procedure of fixing that initial state we're choosing the volume so going from

335
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.800
David Schaich (he): with a to Point B, we know that the

336
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.540
David Schaich (he): temperature is fixed at the high temperature just by virtually

337
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.250
David Schaich (he): isothermal expansion.

338
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.290
David Schaich (he): and this in turn is given by

339
00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.950
David Schaich (he): PA. Times V. A. Over N. For the ideal gas law.

340
00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.680
David Schaich (he): and

341
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:39.250
David Schaich (he): you find the pressure at Point B. This is the same exercise that we went through for the isotherm at the start of today.

342
00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.610
David Schaich (he): Yeah. I don't guess what

343
00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.680
David Schaich (he): we just plug in that high temperature

344
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:58.520
David Schaich (he): number of particles cancels out. and we get you expected ratio of the volume

345
00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:06.420
David Schaich (he): T. A. Sorry V. A. Over Bb. Times. The initial pressure. So that is the same as

346
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.580
David Schaich (he): that we just considered nicer firm and isolation.

347
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.760
David Schaich (he): I think it's good a bit less trivial

348
00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:20.220
David Schaich (he): Once we change from isothermal to Adiabatic expansion

349
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.770
David Schaich (he): so going from might be to see

350
00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:34.260
David Schaich (he): the Adiabatic condition. Entropy of these 2 points is fixed.

351
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.280
David Schaich (he): so that the combination

352
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.240
David Schaich (he): of the volume times the temperature to the 3 half hour

353
00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:48.810
David Schaich (he): it's fixed.

354
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:55.890
David Schaich (he): And here we know all of these qualities. Except for that low temperature which we can

355
00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:01.340
David Schaich (he): isolate again as before

356
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.860
David Schaich (he): you brief. You are calling me

357
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:15.620
David Schaich (he): times the initial temperature. That boy in ratio raised to the two-thirds power again

358
00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.650
David Schaich (he): plugging in

359
00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.690
David Schaich (he): the

360
00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.060
you

361
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:32.450
David Schaich (he): a result for the high temperature in terms of the initial state that we started off with.

362
00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:36.570
David Schaich (he): You can right. This is PA

363
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.780
David Schaich (he): the a over in times.

364
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.640
David Schaich (he): and what your ratio to the hour two-thirds.

365
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.230
David Schaich (he): and see that from this volume ratio

366
00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.270
David Schaich (he): this is as expected.

367
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:55.270
David Schaich (he): It's strictly lower temperature and the high temperature that we started off with.

368
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:57.510
David Schaich (he): This is

369
00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:02.300
David Schaich (he): a qualitative result that we were able to just see by inspection

370
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.640
David Schaich (he): of the Pv diagram.

371
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:07.850
David Schaich (he): we now have a

372
00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:14.730
David Schaich (he): oh creed mathematical derivation for precisely how much lower that low temperature is

373
00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:18.120
David Schaich (he): compared to the high temperature of the hot reservoir.

374
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:32.770
David Schaich (he): We also need to figure out the pressure at Point C, which we can again get from the ideal gas law. The number of particles is fixed. as we

375
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.550
David Schaich (he): you around the cycle in particular.

376
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:40.960
David Schaich (he): fixed from the

377
00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.220
David Schaich (he): initial States at the high temperature. H.

378
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:45.770
David Schaich (he): All the way to

379
00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.090
David Schaich (he): Point c.

380
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:52.490
David Schaich (he): Where do we reach that low temperature? Tl.

381
00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:58.020
David Schaich (he): So PC. Rearranging things is

382
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:05.180
David Schaich (he): refuel of the volumes. Multiply it by the ratio

383
00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.090
David Schaich (he): of the temperatures

384
00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:17.770
David Schaich (he): compared to that initial pressure and the ratio of the temperatures. We have already computed.

385
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.340
David Schaich (he): We get the a times bb to the two-thirds.

386
00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.330
David Schaich (he): divided by Vc.

387
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.090
David Schaich (he): The 5 thirds, and as

388
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:38.820
David Schaich (he): Vc. Is the largest volume that we have with Va. And V. Or smaller.

389
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.880
David Schaich (he): we have the consistency check that

390
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:49.810
David Schaich (he): the pressure at Point c. Is smaller than that at point a. As expected.

391
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.140
David Schaich (he): So the

392
00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:59.630
David Schaich (he): final step i'm getting set to

393
00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.940
David Schaich (he): where we want to be as we go from

394
00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:06.550
David Schaich (he): Point C back to. We also have to

395
00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:09.770
David Schaich (he): consider the

396
00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:11.620
David Schaich (he): final

397
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:16.530
David Schaich (he): process from Point D up to point a, and make sure that

398
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.870
David Schaich (he): the pressure and volume of this point the are located at

399
00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.020
David Schaich (he): the you self-consistent

400
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.100
David Schaich (he): value.

401
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:34.670
David Schaich (he): So with isothermal compression, from Point c.

402
00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:45.500
David Schaich (he): You know that the temperature points D is fixed to be the same low temperature that we had at Point c. Computed already

403
00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:50.480
David Schaich (he): from the fact of the idiotic compression between DNA.

404
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.750
David Schaich (he): You know the

405
00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.600
David Schaich (he): entropies of those 2 points

406
00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.040
David Schaich (he): are equal

407
00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.440
David Schaich (he): simulation

408
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:12.400
David Schaich (he): that we had between B and C. Polls between the

409
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.560
David Schaich (he): and a. just with the

410
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:21.530
David Schaich (he): ratio of

411
00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.960
David Schaich (he): temperatures involving the flip. So we have

412
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:34.130
David Schaich (he): that the volume now is the ratio of hot and or high low temperatures to the Free House Power Times.

413
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:35.110
David Schaich (he): That's

414
00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.550
David Schaich (he): initial

415
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:45.760
David Schaich (he): which we can just plug in the refuel if you see in Vb. So

416
00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.970
David Schaich (he): th over to the threehouse hour is just

417
00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:51.680
David Schaich (he): that ratio to be

418
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.300
David Schaich (he): one power

419
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.870
David Schaich (he): so hot or below is C.

420
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:03.010
David Schaich (he): Times. V. A.

421
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:09.570
David Schaich (he): Which we can confer is greater than Va. In particular. If we

422
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:21.570
David Schaich (he): rearrange this relation between all 4 of the volumes. We can express that as a ratio of V. A. Over Pd. Is equal to

423
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.990
David Schaich (he): this B. Over PC. So the

424
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:31.270
David Schaich (he): amount of Adiabatic compression that is done between

425
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:38.160
David Schaich (he): used to be proportional, the amount of Adiabatic expansion done between

426
00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:39.320
David Schaich (he): B and C.

427
00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:42.180
David Schaich (he): Or

428
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.290
David Schaich (he): alternately, if we

429
00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.970
David Schaich (he): rearrange things further.

430
00:36:48.080 --> 00:37:00.510
David Schaich (he): you can write the a. Over V. B. Equals the D. Over Vc. Which is just saying the amount of isothermal expansion between

431
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:03.250
David Schaich (he): A and B has to be you

432
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:13.930
David Schaich (he): related in this way to the amount of isothermal compression between C and D. So, thanks to that symmetry of the Carnot cycle.

433
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:18.560
David Schaich (he): the balance between isothermal and idiomatic stages.

434
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.820
David Schaich (he): the volumes that we come up with.

435
00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:28.900
David Schaich (he): I'll have to match in this way, both on the Adiabatic

436
00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.580
David Schaich (he): science and the isothermal science.

437
00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.160
David Schaich (he): And then, finally, the

438
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:44.030
David Schaich (he): one last piece of information available for the cycle is the

439
00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:46.120
David Schaich (he): pressure at Point D,

440
00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:51.380
David Schaich (he): which. as before from the

441
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:58.000
David Schaich (he): is Mt. Over V. Temperature is t low.

442
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.780
David Schaich (he): and if we

443
00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:07.540
David Schaich (he): swapped in.

444
00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:13.350
David Schaich (he): Yeah. V. A. Times, Vc. Over Vb.

445
00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:20.030
David Schaich (he): Oops.

446
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.780
David Schaich (he): This is one over. V. So we want PA. Sorry.

447
00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.060
David Schaich (he): Vb: over the ABC.

448
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:30.750
David Schaich (he): Upside down.

449
00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:35.920
David Schaich (he): one over volume. and for that low temperature

450
00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.140
David Schaich (he): we have the result that

451
00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:47.040
David Schaich (he): low temperature is related to P. A. Over N.

452
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.300
David Schaich (he): Times

453
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:53.270
David Schaich (he): to the 2 thirds power

454
00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.870
David Schaich (he): we have Va. Is cancelling out.

455
00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:05.630
David Schaich (he): We have

456
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:14.490
David Schaich (he): the ends cancelling out. and just 2 factors of V. Over Vc.

457
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:19.920
David Schaich (he): First to the 1 h and then to the 2 thirds power. So this all applies down to

458
00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.180
David Schaich (he): that's simple

459
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:27.910
to the five-thirds power.

460
00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:36.320
David Schaich (he): since we see us the more just point that we have this. I was expecting from the

461
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:42.460
David Schaich (he): cycle that we and really start off with is larger than I'm. Sorry it's smaller than

462
00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:44.290
David Schaich (he): the initial pressure.

463
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:47.670
David Schaich (he): That is

464
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.450
okay, confirming the

465
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:53.070
David Schaich (he): consistency of all of these results that

466
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:56.120
David Schaich (he): we have been able to arrived

467
00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.860
David Schaich (he): for our key equations for

468
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.500
David Schaich (he): an ideal gas going around

469
00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.220
David Schaich (he): this these 4 stages.

470
00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:09.970
David Schaich (he): So

471
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:18.010
David Schaich (he): in the end. This demand. how they self-consistent cycle

472
00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.100
David Schaich (he): has given us oh!

473
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:32.300
David Schaich (he): Of the unknown pressures temperatures and

474
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.210
David Schaich (he): final volume

475
00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:41.170
David Schaich (he): fixed in terms of the

476
00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:46.290
David Schaich (he): to control

477
00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.760
David Schaich (he): in any physical realization

478
00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:53.380
David Schaich (he): on this system.

479
00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:04.110
David Schaich (he): So any questions about this procedure of going around the part of the cycle checking it self-consistency and deriving

480
00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:08.740
David Schaich (he): all of the unknown quantities in terms of the inputs that we have

481
00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:23.260
David Schaich (he): not seeing any questions and checking the time

482
00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.560
David Schaich (he): we have a few minutes to.

483
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.770
David Schaich (he): or they go on to the

484
00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:39.930
David Schaich (he): core question. Now that we've seen the cycle of self-consistent, we've derived expressions for all of the variables in terms of

485
00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:52.080
David Schaich (he): just these few inputs. We can get back to the point, to the exercise which was to use these processes to do work by

486
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:55.740
David Schaich (he): moving he from or between.

487
00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:59.190
David Schaich (he): It was hot and cold reservoirs. So the

488
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:06.200
David Schaich (he): point to the Carter cycle Why cargo developed this in the first place, even before

489
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.680
David Schaich (he): the ideal gas law had been formulated.

490
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.160
David Schaich (he): was doing work. bye.

491
00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.040
David Schaich (he): moving heat. and the question is.

492
00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.600
David Schaich (he): how much sheets do we have to move.

493
00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.380
David Schaich (he): and how much work

494
00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:33.210
David Schaich (he): can we do through that process?

495
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:39.950
David Schaich (he): So this is

496
00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:46.670
David Schaich (he): the more interesting question that we

497
00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:52.220
David Schaich (he): we'll be able to answer, thanks to having all around that cycle the first time, and

498
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.560
David Schaich (he): come up with relations between

499
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:58.400
David Schaich (he): all of the variables, just in terms of a few inputs.

500
00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:03.420
David Schaich (he): and for the purpose of answering these questions, how much he to do, how much work.

501
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:05.430
David Schaich (he): It is

502
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.480
David Schaich (he): convenient to

503
00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.260
David Schaich (he): you. Find a few

504
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.340
David Schaich (he): variations on the

505
00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:32.990
David Schaich (he): heat and the work that will help us keep track of the signs that are involved. This heat flows in and out, and work is done both on the system by a surroundings and by the system on the surroundings.

506
00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:35.030
David Schaich (he): In particular. If we

507
00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:38.120
David Schaich (he): you work on the system

508
00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:43.420
David Schaich (he): that raises it's energy.

509
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:50.410
David Schaich (he): and you will call this work going into the system

510
00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.760
David Schaich (he): which is just going to be equal to the

511
00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:00.640
David Schaich (he): work done that we defined last week. which is

512
00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:05.450
David Schaich (he): greater than 0 when work is done on the system. To raise this energy.

513
00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:11.980
David Schaich (he): things get more interesting when we look at by the system.

514
00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:16.260
David Schaich (he): we're we're out

515
00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:19.640
David Schaich (he): that lowers this energy to

516
00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:23.690
David Schaich (he): do useful things for us like turning the wheels on the car

517
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:31.180
David Schaich (he): in order to keep everything positive. We'll find this to be the negative of the work done on the system.

518
00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:37.080
David Schaich (he): So the integral of pressure over volume. the positive sign

519
00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:42.740
David Schaich (he): that's is necessarily greater than 0, because the

520
00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:46.810
David Schaich (he): internal energy of the system is being decreased by this process.

521
00:44:48.760 --> 00:45:00.530
David Schaich (he): As an aside, i'll mention that this integral of pressure over the the is just the area under any of the curves on this pressure volume, diagram

522
00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.380
David Schaich (he): what the integral amounts to

523
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.500
David Schaich (he): we will come back to that perhaps after

524
00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:08.540
David Schaich (he): a break. But similarly

525
00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.010
David Schaich (he): you will find both the

526
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:13.650
David Schaich (he): you into the system

527
00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:20.140
David Schaich (he): and he out of the system to be positive qualities. So when he comes in

528
00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.390
David Schaich (he): that raises the internal energy

529
00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:27.500
David Schaich (he): integral of

530
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:37.290
David Schaich (he): temperature times, the change in entropy which is positive, due to raising the average internal energy of the system.

531
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:39.580
David Schaich (he): and

532
00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:45.000
David Schaich (he): when he was expelled from the system to

533
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:47.230
David Schaich (he): a reservoir, you just

534
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:56.670
David Schaich (he): account for that negative sign in this definition, and then we'll have to worry about it as we go around the cycle.

535
00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:03.110
David Schaich (he): So given all of these definitions. yeah

536
00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:10.150
David Schaich (he): question that we have to address how much work can be done if they give it. Another piece.

537
00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:14.720
David Schaich (he): boils down into the compensation

538
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:30.930
David Schaich (he): of what's called the efficiency of the cycle you can defined to be network that is done by the cycle divided by, or in units of, the total amount of heat

539
00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:38.000
David Schaich (he): it has to flow into the cycle in order to do that work. So the net amount of work done

540
00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.410
David Schaich (he): is the work that the system does on its surroundings.

541
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:50.410
David Schaich (he): minus the work that we have to go into the system that the surroundings do all the assistance to raise this energy

542
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:53.680
David Schaich (he): and all that is

543
00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.850
David Schaich (he): divided by the inflowing heat

544
00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:01.030
David Schaich (he): coming into the system

545
00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:06.440
David Schaich (he): from man. one of its external reservoirs. So this is the

546
00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.020
David Schaich (he): network

547
00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:17.810
David Schaich (he): done by each iteration of the cycle

548
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:23.390
David Schaich (he): in UN itself

549
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:30.820
David Schaich (he): He that flows in.

550
00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.810
David Schaich (he): So if we

551
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:37.100
David Schaich (he): that we have

552
00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:40.150
David Schaich (he): hey.

553
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:52.510
David Schaich (he): this is a system that does more heat, more work on the surroundings than we have to put in in order for it to run.

554
00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:55.170
David Schaich (he): so that corresponds

555
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:56.740
David Schaich (he): to the

556
00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:01.470
David Schaich (he): efficiency being greater than 0. So all 3 of these

557
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:09.530
David Schaich (he): have been defined to be positive quantities. So with what we're being done by the system. and we had to put in to

558
00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:14.460
David Schaich (he): make it wrong. We get a positive efficiency, a lower bound

559
00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.390
David Schaich (he): on.

560
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:19.660
David Schaich (he): and engine

561
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:27.060
David Schaich (he): doing work. and it's also possible to It's an upper band. If we consider the

562
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.160
David Schaich (he): first of all, i'll fill with the

563
00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:37.770
David Schaich (he): in the generalized form that we derived last week. the change in internal energy.

564
00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:53.220
David Schaich (he): thanks to the conservation of energy, has to be matched by the amount of keeps that flows into out of the system. Similarly, the amount of work that flows into out of the system.

565
00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:56.930
David Schaich (he): all of those have to balance, so that energy is conserved.

566
00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.600
David Schaich (he): So rearranging.

567
00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:05.950
David Schaich (he): We have this difference between the work done by the system and done on the system

568
00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:08.380
David Schaich (he): is just that difference between

569
00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:10.140
David Schaich (he): he that flows in

570
00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.690
David Schaich (he): and the heat that flows out.

571
00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:17.520
David Schaich (he): which is trivially less than or equal to

572
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:24.610
David Schaich (he): total amount to in, because all of these, again, are positive quantities. The smallest amount we can subtract

573
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:27.970
David Schaich (he): is going to be 0, which is where quality holds.

574
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:32.350
David Schaich (he): If the in the case where there is no waste

575
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:33.700
David Schaich (he): expelled

576
00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:40.620
David Schaich (he): as we go around our cycle. so if

577
00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:48.380
David Schaich (he): the numerator of the efficiency is less than or equal to this denominator. That is a fancy way of saying

578
00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.060
David Schaich (he): the efficiency

579
00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:53.440
David Schaich (he): is down in the boat by one

580
00:49:54.400 --> 00:50:02.430
David Schaich (he): down the below by 0, and we can interpret this as the you fraction

581
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:09.130
David Schaich (he): of the heat flow back on the screen there at the

582
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:13.090
David Schaich (he): engine can convert

583
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:20.190
David Schaich (he): to work on its surroundings.

584
00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:23.400
David Schaich (he): and the fact that

585
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:28.300
David Schaich (he): the efficiency is bounded by one to the personal thermodynamics

586
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:35.070
David Schaich (he): is sometimes phrase is saying that you can't win. and not

587
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:50.500
David Schaich (he): the context of converting energy to work. You cannot get more work out. then. The amount of energy in the form of heat that goes into the system.

588
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.180
David Schaich (he): and we'll take a

589
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:59.300
David Schaich (he): break now unless there are any immediate questions. and coming back after the break, we all

590
00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:02.760
David Schaich (he): compute the efficiency of the car. No cycle.

591
00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:07.790
David Schaich (he): See if we can make sense of yeah.

592
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:12.210
David Schaich (he): resulting form of it. And in general lessons we can apply for

593
00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:16.220
David Schaich (he): throw dynamic cycles, doing work more generally.

594
00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:24.410
David Schaich (he): So any questions Before I pause the recording, and we have here brief break to wake up.

595
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:36.820
David Schaich (he): All right. Well

596
00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:43.600
David Schaich (he): get back under way. No. sure. Why, the microphones flashing all different colors, but hopefully.

597
00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:47.430
David Schaich (he): those of you who are connected remotely can't hear me

598
00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:51.430
David Schaich (he): speak up in it. Things are not coming through.

599
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:58.290
David Schaich (he): so any questions occur during the break before we go on to the example.

600
00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:08.940
David Schaich (he): Efficiency it's able to do for

601
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:11.080
David Schaich (he): you. This heat flood, or

602
00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:18.710
David Schaich (he): the strategy will be the same as we went through, and checking consistency

603
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:20.730
David Schaich (he): to go around.

604
00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:25.740
David Schaich (he): or stages of the cycle, and figure out what heats and what work

605
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:29.480
David Schaich (he): it's associated with each of those. and

606
00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:33.460
David Schaich (he): it's useful as we do so just for you to

607
00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:36.130
David Schaich (he): look at the

608
00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:43.130
David Schaich (he): corresponding process in the Pv diagram and try to use that to decide If you expect.

609
00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:55.960
David Schaich (he): keep the flow in or out. If you expect work to be done on the system, provide the system. and then the the precise mathematical results in each stage can be checked

610
00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:59.020
David Schaich (he): against that complicated expectation

611
00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:02.990
David Schaich (he): to see if things are working out

612
00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:14.680
David Schaich (he): in the proper way. So you get used to things that can also be a shortcut by inspection you can see which stages are bringing in or out which stages are

613
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:24.510
David Schaich (he): doing work on on the system, or doing more to the system on its surroundings. and look only at those to extract the efficiency

614
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:31.360
David Schaich (he): for more general cycles. So with that

615
00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:39.970
David Schaich (he): first stage we have to consider this is a purple expansion from a to B. We are

616
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:44.300
David Schaich (he): working on in this stage

617
00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.550
David Schaich (he): is defined by it.

618
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:51.050
David Schaich (he): the integral I'm. Starting voting to the final volume.

619
00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:55.760
David Schaich (he): The pressure it's. Functioning.

620
00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:11.180
David Schaich (he): which we know from the ideal gas law is the number of particles Times. The high temperature that is fixed along this stage. divided by the volume integrate over the volume. So

621
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:15.680
David Schaich (he): you just go with the X over X is the one.

622
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:20.810
David Schaich (he): and then to you at your constants that come out.

623
00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:36.160
David Schaich (he): It can be right. It's the of that ratio. and bring in that negative sign to

624
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:41.590
David Schaich (he): invert the ratio, and it's a. A,

625
00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:57.890
David Schaich (he): 11 B. And since Volume B is a larger volume. The argument of the logarithm is less than one. The what, if it itself is negative and overall? We have

626
00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:59.620
David Schaich (he): negative work.

627
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:03.670
David Schaich (he): which means that to get this positive quantity

628
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:16.940
David Schaich (he): we need to negate it and identify this as a contribution to the work beating done. My, the system contributing to ultimate quality work out

629
00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:20.120
David Schaich (he): so hopefully that alliance with

630
00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:26.400
David Schaich (he): what you expected. based on the the qualitative and homelessness

631
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:28.000
David Schaich (he): and the you

632
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:30.750
David Schaich (he): amount to keep flow in the stage

633
00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:42.940
David Schaich (he): in order to keep the temperature fixed. We already saw that it's is expected to flow into the system. We can confirm this plan. considering the

634
00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:48.650
David Schaich (he): connection between internal energy and for sure.

635
00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:56.110
David Schaich (he): the change in temperature being 0 and change in internal energy being

636
00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:58.380
David Schaich (he): the heat

637
00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.670
David Schaich (he): plus the work from the

638
00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:09.230
David Schaich (he): we just have that the heat flow in this first stage from a to B

639
00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:12.410
David Schaich (he): is negative of the work.

640
00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:14.270
David Schaich (he): and greater than 0,

641
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:17.460
David Schaich (he): so contributing to

642
00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:21.090
David Schaich (he): you can flow in amount of heat you in

643
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:24.890
David Schaich (he): by contributing to the efficiency of the cycle.

644
00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:40.440
David Schaich (he): So that's one stage down in the next stage.

645
00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:41.310
This.

646
00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:45.420
David Schaich (he): to remind ourselves, is idiomatic expansion

647
00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:48.680
David Schaich (he): I need to see which turns out to be

648
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:53.100
David Schaich (he): a bit simpler than the isothermal expansion.

649
00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:56.890
David Schaich (he): simply because the

650
00:56:58.170 --> 00:57:00.260
David Schaich (he): he that is exchanged

651
00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:13.290
David Schaich (he): in this stage is 0 on the definition of the idiotic process. and as a consequence of the change and the energy is simply given by it. You work

652
00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:15.050
David Schaich (he): sure

653
00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:21.590
David Schaich (he): all of these.

654
00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:24.100
David Schaich (he): and that change in the energy

655
00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:28.090
David Schaich (he): is related to a change in the temperature.

656
00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:37.660
David Schaich (he): We has n times the final temperature t little I see initial temperature t high

657
00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:45.180
David Schaich (he): we're we're in a real factor of See how they one of the

658
00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.860
David Schaich (he): temperature ratios that we computed before the break.

659
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:52.350
David Schaich (he): and I can't write.

660
00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:54.370
David Schaich (he): Yes.

661
00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:00.600
David Schaich (he): P. A. V. A. By the ideal gas law

662
00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:06.130
David Schaich (he): and the ratio of temperatures

663
00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:14.040
David Schaich (he): being related to the ratio of the volumes that we can fix

664
00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:17.590
David Schaich (he): experimentally, we that two-thirds power.

665
00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:25.610
David Schaich (he): So we have the over Vc. To the two-thirds. minus one.

666
00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:31.250
David Schaich (he): because the ratio is less than one

667
00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:33.090
David Schaich (he): negative

668
00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:42.990
David Schaich (he): number. So another contribution 2 W. Out of work done by the system on its surroundings, which we can put to use

669
00:58:44.790 --> 00:58:46.520
David Schaich (he): to

670
00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:51.660
David Schaich (he): any other form of work.

671
00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:55.530
David Schaich (he): And at this point we are

672
00:58:57.610 --> 00:59:09.400
David Schaich (he): very nearly done, thanks to symmetry and the Carnot cycle, that the isothermal mediatic expansion is followed by matching isothermal and Adiabatic compression stages with

673
00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:14.220
David Schaich (he): the fixed volume ratios that we derived before.

674
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:16.290
David Schaich (he): So the

675
00:59:16.830 --> 00:59:19.860
David Schaich (he): compression from 1 point, C to D,

676
00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:22.200
David Schaich (he): it just proceeds

677
00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:24.910
David Schaich (he): in much the same way, as

678
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:28.460
David Schaich (he): you know, isothermal expansion from a to B.

679
00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:30.550
David Schaich (he): There you go.

680
00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:36.510
David Schaich (he): that the work is the integral

681
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:45.640
David Schaich (he): from the the final volume out of now and times, the low temperature

682
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:50.430
David Schaich (he): which we can

683
00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:52.670
David Schaich (he): rewrite it as.

684
00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:55.770
David Schaich (he): and times the high temperature.

685
00:59:58.050 --> 01:00:07.020
David Schaich (he): I'm the ratio. I to high temperatures, so I just multiply them, divided by th. and pointed

686
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:09.560
David Schaich (he): in. Here

687
01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:10.800
David Schaich (he): we will have

688
01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:15.910
David Schaich (he): the Board of Pd. Over PC. With the negative sign that I call

689
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.390
David Schaich (he): over Vd.

690
01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:28.480
David Schaich (he): So again we have the temperature ratio that we computed.

691
01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:29.620
David Schaich (he): and the you

692
01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:32.770
David Schaich (he): ratio of those 2 volumes.

693
01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:40.530
David Schaich (he): the C. Over v. D we related to Vb over V. A. So that gives us

694
01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:50.170
David Schaich (he): that's the ratio of the two-thirds times, the logarithm

695
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:57.880
David Schaich (he): Oh. the ratio of different.

696
01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.320
David Schaich (he): So

697
01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:06.200
David Schaich (he): all of those are positive factors.

698
01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:08.440
David Schaich (he): So let me

699
01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:11.260
David Schaich (he): how's the work being done, contribution

700
01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:19.020
David Schaich (he): to work that has to be done on the system by its surroundings rather than useful work. that we are getting out

701
01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:20.140
the system.

702
01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.460
David Schaich (he): and finally, as well for the

703
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:27.930
David Schaich (he): you back compression. Our final stage.

704
01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:34.630
David Schaich (he): There is no and change. The internal energy

705
01:01:37.770 --> 01:01:39.280
David Schaich (he): is just a work

706
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.910
David Schaich (he): which is 3 has

707
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:48.730
David Schaich (he): times 10 times the final temperature, minus the initial temperature

708
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.310
David Schaich (he): exactly

709
01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:54.620
David Schaich (he): what we had about with an overall negative sign.

710
01:01:57.370 --> 01:02:03.310
David Schaich (he): Negative work of the Id of adding expansion phase which we saw is greater than 0.

711
01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:08.900
David Schaich (he): Therefore, another stage where we have to do work on the system rather than

712
01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.660
David Schaich (he): didn't work out of it.

713
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:14.210
David Schaich (he): So we

714
01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.860
David Schaich (he): almost forgot to mention

715
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:30.820
David Schaich (he): in the I. Of the impression Stage, CD. We again have that the work is the negative.

716
01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:33.920
David Schaich (he): So the heat exchange is the negative work.

717
01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:39.980
David Schaich (he): so that's greater than 0. So that's less than 0 that goes into you

718
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:50.820
David Schaich (he): The waste he's expelled to the low Temperature reservoir that we were in contact with along the isothermal compression stage.

719
01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:59.230
David Schaich (he): which means that we can ignore that when computing the

720
01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:01.640
David Schaich (he): overall efficiency of the cycle.

721
01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:12.130
David Schaich (he): that's a shortcut we can take. That's for your confidence in analyzing the overall quality of shape of the cycle to

722
01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:21.810
David Schaich (he): where the different contributions are arising. and we now have all of the to compute

723
01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:25.550
David Schaich (he): the efficiency.

724
01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:27.330
We write it Here

725
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:30.150
David Schaich (he): it's close to hand.

726
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:32.220
David Schaich (he): Hmm.

727
01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:39.280
David Schaich (he): Me for the efficiency. The you know we're in the by the system, minus the work done on the system.

728
01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:47.400
David Schaich (he): Provide the system is the negative work done in the

729
01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:52.960
David Schaich (he): and CD. Because we have to find work to be

730
01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:58.460
David Schaich (he): You'll work that he's on on the system to raise this internal energy by giving that

731
01:03:58.660 --> 01:03:59.580
David Schaich (he): we did

732
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:03.370
David Schaich (he): a positive quality for the workouts.

733
01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:07.480
David Schaich (he): So we are here. Oh, no!

734
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.770
David Schaich (he): Our definitions of we're in the

735
01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.670
David Schaich (he): positive qualities

736
01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.800
David Schaich (he): and make it easy to keep practical signs.

737
01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.780
David Schaich (he): And then we need the

738
01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:28.880
David Schaich (he): that flows into the system which comes entirely from that initial stage

739
01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:33.160
David Schaich (he): from a Tob, because for a little expansion

740
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:37.240
David Schaich (he): that this was

741
01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:42.810
David Schaich (he): that stage again, a positive quantity.

742
01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:46.450
David Schaich (he): So if we plug all of this in work out

743
01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:48.910
David Schaich (he): minus W. A. B

744
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:52.510
David Schaich (he): minus the work in.

745
01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:58.060
David Schaich (he): And this here is.

746
01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:00.870
David Schaich (he): Can you go ahead?

747
01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:10.620
David Schaich (he): So this 2 expansion stages both contribute to the work done by the system. Yeah. Other 2 stages are subtracted.

748
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:13.700
David Schaich (he): You get a minus work, CD.

749
01:05:14.590 --> 01:05:15.860
David Schaich (he): On this work.

750
01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:25.320
David Schaich (he): all of that divided by it. Negative of the work on the is in front of the expansion stage.

751
01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:29.140
David Schaich (he): This simplifies a bit because

752
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:31.600
David Schaich (he): we saw that

753
01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:36.270
David Schaich (he): the work, the a done in the final idiomatic stage was the negative

754
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:43.290
David Schaich (he): initial expansion fees. So

755
01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:49.670
David Schaich (he): those 2 terms cancel all of the negative signs cancel, and we can just

756
01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:51.430
David Schaich (he): you buy it

757
01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:56.860
David Schaich (he): both of the remaining terms by the input he. W. A. To get one.

758
01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.070
David Schaich (he): What the ratio

759
01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:02.450
David Schaich (he): the work in the isothermal

760
01:06:02.810 --> 01:06:06.320
David Schaich (he): compression things over that to be isothermal

761
01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:07.480
David Schaich (he): expansion.

762
01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:10.540
David Schaich (he): So

763
01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:15.040
David Schaich (he): you have computer those quantities work.

764
01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:19.320
David Schaich (he): See the

765
01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:24.190
David Schaich (he): he's here where he was on the previous page.

766
01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:36.450
David Schaich (he): Just plug them in into the overall expression for the efficiency. You have it. Yeah.

767
01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:41.070
David Schaich (he): Times. This ratio of temperatures

768
01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:45.750
David Schaich (he): all right the

769
01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.560
David Schaich (he): over the a

770
01:06:49.210 --> 01:07:03.930
David Schaich (he): impression work back from the first stage. We have a similar now here arguments in the opposite orientation log of Va

771
01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:06.260
David Schaich (he): over Vb.

772
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:19.350
David Schaich (he): Okay. pre-factor cancels. The logs are the same up to an overall negative sign that inverts. The ratio of one of the other of them. So we find

773
01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:24.370
David Schaich (he): ultimately with the the efficiency of the Carnot cycle

774
01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:27.860
David Schaich (he): is one minus the temperature ratio

775
01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:30.390
David Schaich (he): the L. Over T. H.

776
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.140
David Schaich (he): So we can

777
01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:39.730
David Schaich (he): check that this behaves as an efficiency. Should we found that

778
01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:44.760
David Schaich (he): we're engine, we should be a positive quantity, and because

779
01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:51.980
David Schaich (he): t level is. should be less than see how we have

780
01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:57.480
David Schaich (he): the quantity that is always less than one in this ratio.

781
01:07:58.090 --> 01:08:02.060
David Schaich (he): and the efficiency approaches 0 as

782
01:08:04.450 --> 01:08:14.530
David Schaich (he): the temperatures approach each other high in the temperatures of the 2 reservoirs that the cycle that the system is in contact with as it goes around the cycle.

783
01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:27.510
David Schaich (he): No, to be here the same if they go to one. the 2 terms cancel off, and you end up with vanishing efficiency. This is the situation where

784
01:08:28.529 --> 01:08:35.859
David Schaich (he): overall cycle just collapses into a single iso term. with no idiotic expansion spaces.

785
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:39.210
David Schaich (he): You expand as a terminally contract. Iso properly.

786
01:08:40.859 --> 01:08:42.779
David Schaich (he): Don't get anything.

787
01:08:42.970 --> 01:08:44.100
David Schaich (he): How about that?

788
01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:48.660
David Schaich (he): You keep it as being exchanged along those

789
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.189
David Schaich (he): processes. and then the other extreme. We're

790
01:08:59.189 --> 01:09:05.850
David Schaich (he): the ratio. It was 0, but the maximum that we can have is

791
01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:10.220
David Schaich (he): just one on the second term vanishes.

792
01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:11.470
David Schaich (he): And

793
01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.340
David Schaich (he): the reason I have made this a strict inequality rather than

794
01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:18.189
David Schaich (he): hey you

795
01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:23.859
David Schaich (he): less than or equals 2 that we got from the first law of thermodynamics is just because

796
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:29.840
David Schaich (he): really this ratio of temperatures going to 0 is not really physical, but

797
01:09:30.109 --> 01:09:42.229
David Schaich (he): you would need it either, or both of the low temperature heading to absolute 0. What are you? High temperature Reservoir becoming a

798
01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:45.770
David Schaich (he): definitely helped. both of which

799
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:50.550
David Schaich (he): are not going to be realized in any physical material.

800
01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:52.460
David Schaich (he): So

801
01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.010
David Schaich (he): we can just impose that bit of

802
01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:02.880
David Schaich (he): external physical knowledge to identify that

803
01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:17.870
David Schaich (he): the efficiency is going to be less than one. and this, in fact. next to a the general results. even though

804
01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:20.380
David Schaich (he): this is the year

805
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:27.150
David Schaich (he): efficiency computed just for a particular and rather special thermodynamic cycle discovered by Carnot

806
01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:29.370
David Schaich (he): very nearly 200 years ago

807
01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:35.850
David Schaich (he): some of the lessons that we are seeing from our results our

808
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:46.050
David Schaich (he): fully general for any self-consistent from a dynamic cycle that's comes back around the 2 with starting points.

809
01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:48.760
David Schaich (he): So

810
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.160
David Schaich (he): in general, whenever the

811
01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:59.430
David Schaich (he): minimum and maximum temperatures of the cycle

812
01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:02.940
David Schaich (he): approach each other where there's no temperature change.

813
01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:05.940
David Schaich (he): you will always

814
01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:18.150
David Schaich (he): Hello! The vanishing efficiency 0 just because there is in this case. No.

815
01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:23.980
David Schaich (he): we'll repeat to you any of the work that we want the engine to do

816
01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:29.190
David Schaich (he): or 2.

817
01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:32.030
David Schaich (he): Turn this on its head.

818
01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:33.990
David Schaich (he): The

819
01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.590
David Schaich (he): smaller this ratio of so the

820
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:43.340
David Schaich (he): larger the hot reservoir can be made

821
01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:45.450
David Schaich (he): compared to

822
01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.710
David Schaich (he): the cold reservoir that it's the low temperature.

823
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:52.430
David Schaich (he): Yes. a more efficient engine.

824
01:11:53.730 --> 01:11:54.510
which

825
01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.380
David Schaich (he): later in the nineteenth century, this general result

826
01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.480
David Schaich (he): was motivation for a fellow named Rudolf, us

827
01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.420
David Schaich (he): to try to come up with a thermodynamic cycle.

828
01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.410
the physical realization of it

829
01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:22.980
David Schaich (he): that would maximize the efficiency by maximizing Yeah. High temperature compared to the low temperature of a cycle. and the result we known about today as the Diesel Engine

830
01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:25.910
David Schaich (he): tutorial on Thursday.

831
01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:33.000
David Schaich (he): and there's actually there's also something that we can say about the

832
01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:37.640
David Schaich (he): upper bound or the limit on this efficiency.

833
01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:41.280
David Schaich (he): So for you the call

834
01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:46.900
David Schaich (he): from the first of all, that

835
01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:54.980
David Schaich (he): the difference you know the network done by the cycle compared to the on those.

836
01:12:55.990 --> 01:13:01.840
David Schaich (he): Of course it has to be done on the system in order for disabled to run has to be equal

837
01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:07.880
David Schaich (he): to the net amount of heat. Well, in order to consider energy.

838
01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:11.450
David Schaich (he): we can rewrite the efficiency in general as

839
01:13:12.490 --> 01:13:14.140
David Schaich (he): entirely in terms

840
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.820
David Schaich (he): that amount

841
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:24.880
David Schaich (he): on the numerator divided by the total influence he in the denominator.

842
01:13:25.730 --> 01:13:27.110
David Schaich (he): one minus

843
01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:30.030
David Schaich (he): the ratio of waste.

844
01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:42.800
David Schaich (he): It's still to the cold reservoir compared to the input needs coming from the hot reservoir. But we forget this physical illustration of the process

845
01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:48.510
David Schaich (he): one more time, not bothering to zoom out because we're only interested in

846
01:13:48.680 --> 01:14:02.540
David Schaich (he): the key flow here in a particular. observing that the inflowing heat it's coming in from that hot reservoir at the high temperature th the waste he was expelled into the cold reservoir

847
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.980
David Schaich (he): on the left, the temperature to low.

848
01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:12.250
David Schaich (he): which means that we can

849
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:17.090
David Schaich (he): we, in our definition of heat, as that

850
01:14:17.150 --> 01:14:29.340
David Schaich (he): fixed temperature times the chain to the entropy. to rewrite this expression and kind of the looks for sure. I see now just entropy

851
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:30.820
David Schaich (he): that is expelled

852
01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:34.440
David Schaich (he): to the call for some more divided by the

853
01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:39.570
David Schaich (he): high temperature of the hot reservoir.

854
01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:45.290
David Schaich (he): This is coming in

855
01:14:47.370 --> 01:14:48.980
David Schaich (he): hot reservoir.

856
01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:54.950
David Schaich (he): so the inflowing heat is the high temperature

857
01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:58.100
David Schaich (he): times the amount of entropy that what was

858
01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:02.590
David Schaich (he): from the hot reservoir into the system.

859
01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:06.050
David Schaich (he): So after

860
01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.250
David Schaich (he): each iteration of the cycle.

861
01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:14.280
David Schaich (he): we end up back to our starting point

862
01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.690
David Schaich (he): a defined by a

863
01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:22.600
David Schaich (he): which determines the amount of entropy that is.

864
01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:29.800
David Schaich (he): in the system itself. All that essay it's fixed from our calculations previously.

865
01:15:30.690 --> 01:15:35.310
David Schaich (he): and through the process of going around the 4 stages of the cycle, or.

866
01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:39.480
David Schaich (he): in fact, for general cycle. How many stages there are?

867
01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:41.970
David Schaich (he): What are you?

868
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:51.610
David Schaich (he): And to the cool reservoir?

869
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:54.490
David Schaich (he): Wow.

870
01:15:57.650 --> 01:16:00.230
David Schaich (he): it's been removed

871
01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:10.290
David Schaich (he): on the hot reservoir? So if we now apply it. the second law, in addition to

872
01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:13.960
David Schaich (he): the first. you know the

873
01:16:14.210 --> 01:16:18.150
David Schaich (he): whole change in entropy for the system and its surroundings

874
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:21.070
David Schaich (he): as we go around. Each iteration of the cycle

875
01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:30.340
David Schaich (he): is going to be the S. A. Is the same, so that cancels out before and after

876
01:16:33.190 --> 01:16:37.650
David Schaich (he): the increase in that entropy in the cold reservoir.

877
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:41.910
David Schaich (he): with a positive sign to the change. The

878
01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:47.020
David Schaich (he): removal of entropy from the reservoir comes in with a negative sign.

879
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:50.330
David Schaich (he): and the second one tells us that this is

880
01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:57.020
David Schaich (he): always non-negative and generally positive. So if we rearrange this expression, we

881
01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.870
David Schaich (he): I get this ratio

882
01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:02.460
David Schaich (he): oh.

883
01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:05.990
David Schaich (he): changes in entropy in the cold and hot reservoirs

884
01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:10.540
David Schaich (he): always has to be greater than or equal to one.

885
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:19.780
David Schaich (he): Which means that video ratio of

886
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:27.570
David Schaich (he): keep flowing out to the cold reservoir compared to heat flowing in from the hot one. it's not necessarily

887
01:17:27.650 --> 01:17:32.510
David Schaich (he): or equal to the corresponding ratio of the temperatures.

888
01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:36.090
David Schaich (he): So, going back to the efficiency

889
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:40.990
David Schaich (he): which we have in terms of either the heat or this ratio of

890
01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.050
David Schaich (he): entropy flows

891
01:17:44.010 --> 01:17:47.750
David Schaich (he): when, the amount being subtracted, is maximized.

892
01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:48.980
David Schaich (he): have one.

893
01:17:52.410 --> 01:18:01.490
David Schaich (he): then we have. I'm sorry when it's minimized. The email. being subtracted has to be at least one. It's minimum is one. When you subtract the minimum amount

894
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:03.770
David Schaich (he): you get the maximum efficiency.

895
01:18:06.850 --> 01:18:09.970
David Schaich (he): the efficiency can be no more, and

896
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:11.550
David Schaich (he): one minus

897
01:18:12.090 --> 01:18:17.380
David Schaich (he): the ratio of those temperatures which we saw was less than one.

898
01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:29.370
David Schaich (he): My Our condition, that below temperature of the cold reservoir is lower. and that is the top reservoir. So

899
01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:35.890
David Schaich (he): there is a general theoretical maximum on the efficiency

900
01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:37.980
David Schaich (he): of the engine.

901
01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:42.160
David Schaich (he): So this is sometimes phrase is saying

902
01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:51.100
David Schaich (he): that if the first law tells you you can't win, You get out more work from an engine that you put in in the fall of heat.

903
01:18:54.540 --> 01:19:03.470
David Schaich (he): the maximum efficiency. It's less than one from the second law sometimes. Not only can we not win.

904
01:19:04.570 --> 01:19:16.820
David Schaich (he): you can't even break even. There's no such thing as a perpetual motion. That machine that would you represented as a thermodynamic cycle that goes around

905
01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:19.510
David Schaich (he): on day

906
01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.310
David Schaich (he): as it goes around it stages it converts the

907
01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:30.380
David Schaich (he): 100% of the heat flow into useful work. There is always some that has to be lost

908
01:19:31.890 --> 01:19:43.040
David Schaich (he): as a consequence of that second law of thermodynamics. And, moreover. you can recognize this down from the second law. Yes, exactly the

909
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:46.230
David Schaich (he): efficiency we computer for the Carnot cycle itself.

910
01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:52.570
David Schaich (he): So the kind of cycle ends up being.

911
01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.860
David Schaich (he): We're having the maximum possible

912
01:20:00.670 --> 01:20:02.630
David Schaich (he): efficiency data.

913
01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:05.840
David Schaich (he): You guys

914
01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:11.030
David Schaich (he): consistent with the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of energy

915
01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:12.890
David Schaich (he): and the increase of entropy.

916
01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.370
David Schaich (he): And

917
01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.820
David Schaich (he): it may be worth considering why it

918
01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:30.600
David Schaich (he): We don't actually use the Carnot cycle. It's maximum efficiency to do things like drive our cars

919
01:20:31.090 --> 01:20:34.000
David Schaich (he): instead. We use things like Diesel cycles, or the

920
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:38.560
David Schaich (he): so called auto cycle that corresponds to an internal combustion petrol

921
01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:41.520
David Schaich (he): engine. I can look at those on Thursday.

922
01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:44.860
David Schaich (he): but

923
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:51.130
David Schaich (he): the car of the cycle, despite being the most efficient use of energy.

924
01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.280
David Schaich (he): is

925
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:56.450
David Schaich (he): not used for any practical devices.

926
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:57.690
I know

927
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:58.510
David Schaich (he): the goal.

928
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:06.810
David Schaich (he): See if any of you have any suggestions as to why. That is

929
01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:33.130
David Schaich (he): reason is that

930
01:21:33.770 --> 01:21:36.930
David Schaich (he): isothermal

931
01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:51.340
David Schaich (he): expansion and compression stages. I have to go slowly in order for key transfers. We will proceed and keep the temperature fixed so expanding from a to B, and then compressing from C to D.

932
01:21:51.630 --> 01:22:01.370
David Schaich (he): All of those are too slow to be useful in everyday applications. We need want to

933
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:04.620
David Schaich (he): probably all that

934
01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:08.140
David Schaich (he): 20 miles an hour rather than 20 feet a day.

935
01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:14.560
David Schaich (he): It may be useful exercise actually to

936
01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:22.170
David Schaich (he): come up with an estimate of how fast you provide the car based on the Carnot cycle compared to the cycles

937
01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:26.330
David Schaich (he): Cfo. Next homework assigned.

938
01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:36.730
David Schaich (he): If there's one last topic related to thermodynamics. So all these stats

939
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:46.090
David Schaich (he): we will wrap up with today, which is what happens if we

940
01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:54.110
David Schaich (he): cycle or any other cycle in reverse.

941
01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:56.100
David Schaich (he): then

942
01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:58.780
David Schaich (he): what we would be doing so

943
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.240
David Schaich (he): rather than

944
01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:05.540
David Schaich (he): expanding. I said thermally at the high temperature, teh

945
01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:08.010
David Schaich (he): and compressing at the low temperature T. L.

946
01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:11.300
David Schaich (he): If we were to impress at the highest

947
01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:16.320
David Schaich (he): and expand at the low temperature.

948
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:29.410
David Schaich (he): Simply from that all the work that we've already done. We just have to negate all the signs. So we are going to put in. I met animals

949
01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:38.790
David Schaich (he): work into the cycle. We have to do work on it rather than getting more out of it. and instead of having heat flow

950
01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:41.980
David Schaich (he): from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir.

951
01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:47.760
David Schaich (he): As we go around the cycle and reverse, we remove these.

952
01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:51.500
David Schaich (he): probably

953
01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:58.730
David Schaich (he): that cool reservoir. So

954
01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.770
David Schaich (he): this rather than a

955
01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.260
David Schaich (he): and Jim

956
01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:07.800
David Schaich (he): the refrigerator.

957
01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:12.980
David Schaich (he): putting in work to remove heat.

958
01:24:14.910 --> 01:24:16.090
David Schaich (he): and

959
01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:27.670
David Schaich (he): on to you another page, just to

960
01:24:28.450 --> 01:24:33.350
David Schaich (he): we find the analogy, the analogous quantity to efficiency.

961
01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:37.450
David Schaich (he): I'll be able to what it's called. do you?

962
01:24:39.490 --> 01:24:40.830
David Schaich (he): How efficient

963
01:24:43.730 --> 01:24:45.600
David Schaich (he): a performance for

964
01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:50.160
David Schaich (he): this set up The question is.

965
01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:58.620
David Schaich (he): how much he's I mean into the cycle. Can we remove from the cold reservoir

966
01:24:58.830 --> 01:25:03.430
David Schaich (he): for a given net amount of work being done

967
01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:14.250
David Schaich (he): so that that amount of work now is.

968
01:25:19.290 --> 01:25:20.160
David Schaich (he): See it

969
01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:21.310
oops

970
01:25:33.730 --> 01:25:36.020
David Schaich (he): science in this equation.

971
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:50.390
David Schaich (he): Yeah, we're interested in not how much work we can do out of the cycle, but how much work we have to put in. So

972
01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:51.670
that is

973
01:25:51.930 --> 01:25:56.770
David Schaich (he): what is going to be the quality of the denominator. We have to worry about

974
01:25:57.050 --> 01:26:02.680
David Schaich (he): any work that we can get out at some stage in the refrigerator. It's just a win

975
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:05.770
David Schaich (he): we get applying. Indeed.

976
01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:23.370
David Schaich (he): the network is equal to the negative of the that heat. so that the overall energy is conserved. and we can rearrange this into

977
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:29.520
David Schaich (he): one divided by the ratio

978
01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:31.700
David Schaich (he): of keep flowing out

979
01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:39.060
David Schaich (he): now into the hot reservoir. If I could like to keep going in

980
01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:41.580
David Schaich (he): to the cold reservoir. So

981
01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:49.190
David Schaich (he): yeah.

982
01:26:52.680 --> 01:27:00.410
David Schaich (he): incoming heats corresponding to th Times Delta S. Is he's given by

983
01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:05.660
David Schaich (he): the low temperature? Then it flows out

984
01:27:07.050 --> 01:27:08.320
David Schaich (he): 6 bill.

985
01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:16.210
David Schaich (he): The high temperature ensemble. so the overall ratio

986
01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:21.400
David Schaich (he): find the second one again. In the

987
01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:23.120
David Schaich (he): is

988
01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:30.590
David Schaich (he): the upload entropy. It's always greater than the influence. Entropy of the overall amount of entropy

989
01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:32.080
David Schaich (he): never decreases.

990
01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:37.980
David Schaich (he): We use some of our work well, just to jail straight to

991
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:44.030
David Schaich (he): inequality. Now the T out is associated with hot temperature.

992
01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:45.840
David Schaich (he): and then

993
01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:51.000
David Schaich (he): incoming heat is associated with the low temperature.

994
01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:53.550
David Schaich (he): So this is the

995
01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.020
David Schaich (he): minimum

996
01:27:58.270 --> 01:28:08.200
David Schaich (he): value for this refuel of it. He transfers that shows up in the coefficient of performance. So when that denominator is minimized.

997
01:28:08.430 --> 01:28:12.320
David Schaich (he): we end up with a maximum coefficient of performance

998
01:28:12.490 --> 01:28:14.160
David Schaich (he): on that.

999
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:18.420
David Schaich (he): So the maximum that we can have.

1000
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:26.040
David Schaich (he): Yes. one over temperature, ratio. minimum temperature, ratio.

1001
01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:27.950
David Schaich (he): When

1002
01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:34.310
David Schaich (he): the amount of entropy in the universe it's left on change minus one

1003
01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:40.090
David Schaich (he): you right in this way.

1004
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:44.730
David Schaich (he): It is

1005
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:49.710
David Schaich (he): the low temperature divided by the difference

1006
01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:55.480
David Schaich (he): between the high and low temperature temperatures of the

1007
01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:08.450
David Schaich (he): So one thing to note about this red, and the contrast to the efficiency. It is easy for the coefficients to be greater than one and a Dean Wendy.

1008
01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:12.500
David Schaich (he): Temperatures of the I called reservoirs

1009
01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.580
David Schaich (he): approach each other become

1010
01:29:17.230 --> 01:29:18.620
David Schaich (he): and believe it, or they

1011
01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:28.040
David Schaich (he): perhaps, to having that same temperature, we actually did a diversion to coefficient of performance. a low temperature divided by 0,

1012
01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.690
David Schaich (he): and all that is saying is

1013
01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:42.200
David Schaich (he): not very interesting or useful in the case where the cold reservoir is the same temperature as the hot reservoir. we Don't have to do any work to

1014
01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:43.820
David Schaich (he): shit to you between them.

1015
01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:54.510
David Schaich (he): But typical coefficients of performance or so. The commercial refrigerator is that.

1016
01:29:54.650 --> 01:29:57.770
David Schaich (he): or in the kitchen tend to be around

1017
01:29:58.190 --> 01:29:59.500
David Schaich (he): 5 to 6,

1018
01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:04.660
David Schaich (he): I think greater than one is still order one. And

1019
01:30:06.230 --> 01:30:08.850
David Schaich (he): as what's the case for the

1020
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:13.230
David Schaich (he): efficiency, the cardio cycle

1021
01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:16.060
David Schaich (he): realizes this maximum

1022
01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:22.680
David Schaich (he): coefficient to performance. It's used as a refrigerator.

1023
01:30:24.930 --> 01:30:32.910
David Schaich (he): But again, it is too slow to carry out those iso thermal cycles for the size of the processes in the Carnot cycle.

1024
01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:34.510
David Schaich (he): So bad

1025
01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:38.480
David Schaich (he): real refrigerators are significantly less efficient than

1026
01:30:40.610 --> 01:30:44.520
David Schaich (he): the Carnot isothermal Adiabatic expansion would be.

1027
01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:50.160
David Schaich (he): So that is actually

1028
01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:54.020
David Schaich (he): the end of applications of the canonical ensemble.

1029
01:30:54.570 --> 01:31:11.090
David Schaich (he): We started from micro State energies. Use those 2 derive the partition function from there. Yeah. Internal energy, the entropy, ideal gas law and generalized first of all thermodynamics.

1030
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:15.020
David Schaich (he): and then put all of those results to work

1031
01:31:18.930 --> 01:31:20.690
David Schaich (he): in the form of it.

1032
01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:33.460
David Schaich (he): Heat, engines, and refrigerators, focusing on the Carnot cycle as sorry. first and most efficient. I don't know what happened there. First, the most efficient

1033
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:40.520
David Schaich (he): heat engine approaching this 200 fourth day. and on Thursday we will look at

1034
01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:47.420
David Schaich (he): some more practical. It's less efficient. It's thermodynamic cycles corresponding to

1035
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:58.290
David Schaich (he): natural and Diesel engines. But for the remaining few minutes, of today and all of tomorrow you will pop back to

1036
01:31:59.970 --> 01:32:02.350
David Schaich (he): foundational theory. And look at the

1037
01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:12.510
David Schaich (he): statistical ensemble that we focus on in this module. It's called Grand canonical ensemble. I'll introduce you today. Dig into it tomorrow.

1038
01:32:12.650 --> 01:32:15.570
David Schaich (he): Before that. Any questions about

1039
01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:22.810
David Schaich (he): thermodynamic cycles. the Carnot cycle, heat engines, refrigerators, efficiency

1040
01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:29.140
David Schaich (he): or any of those applications before we switch gears back to something a bit more

1041
01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:31.320
David Schaich (he): theoretical and less applied.

1042
01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:59.720
David Schaich (he): So to motivate the grand canonical ensemble.

1043
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:11.340
David Schaich (he): It is useful to think back about where we started with Cisco ensembles in this molecule. Recalling that the

1044
01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:14.350
David Schaich (he): the generic statistical ensemble is

1045
01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:21.950
David Schaich (he): a probability space where the the microstates, the outcome sets that we observe.

1046
01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:27.660
David Schaich (he): we consider to be some collection of particles that are evolving in time.

1047
01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:30.730
David Schaich (he): and each possible outcome is a snapshot

1048
01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:36.120
David Schaich (he): of all of the information about all those particles at a given point in time

1049
01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:37.890
David Schaich (he): for the unsolved and

1050
01:33:39.370 --> 01:33:41.010
David Schaich (he): probabilistically

1051
01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:50.240
David Schaich (he): samples those different possible microstates, as time goes on. subject to certain constraints that are

1052
01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:52.220
motivated by physics.

1053
01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:59.200
David Schaich (he): Do you? Simplest realization of which. in that micro

1054
01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:02.100
David Schaich (he): all right

1055
01:34:05.330 --> 01:34:08.070
David Schaich (he): systems that directly conserve

1056
01:34:09.490 --> 01:34:10.700
David Schaich (he): the energy

1057
01:34:12.170 --> 01:34:13.720
David Schaich (he): and the particle number.

1058
01:34:15.450 --> 01:34:17.280
David Schaich (he): so systems that are

1059
01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:26.030
David Schaich (he): completely isolated from their surroundings. Unable to exchange any heat, unable to do any work.

1060
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:29.940
David Schaich (he): and unable to change the number of particles that they have.

1061
01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:34.010
David Schaich (he): and to get to a more useful

1062
01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:38.380
David Schaich (he): situation that we could.

1063
01:34:38.570 --> 01:34:42.830
David Schaich (he): We're usually imagine experimenting with and manipulating.

1064
01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:45.130
David Schaich (he): We

1065
01:34:46.650 --> 01:34:48.060
David Schaich (he): introduce me

1066
01:34:51.320 --> 01:35:04.350
David Schaich (he): demanding this complete isolation. You were able to allow energy to be exchanged between the system and its surroundings. We fixed temperature

1067
01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:07.420
David Schaich (he): of the

1068
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:11.670
David Schaich (he): through heat exchange with some large

1069
01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:15.050
David Schaich (he): external from the reservoir, and that is the

1070
01:35:18.570 --> 01:35:26.200
David Schaich (he): the starting point of the context in which we've been carrying out all this work on ideal gases and dynamic cycles.

1071
01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:30.640
David Schaich (he): So the next step now is, it's the logical

1072
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:35.480
David Schaich (he): conclusion of these 2 processes

1073
01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:45.740
David Schaich (he): going from the micro canonical case of conservative particle number of energy completely isolated problem.

1074
01:35:47.490 --> 01:35:48.950
David Schaich (he): The surroundings

1075
01:35:54.870 --> 01:36:00.050
David Schaich (he): and the canonical case. Yeah. actually a particle number fixed

1076
01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:04.680
David Schaich (he): energy, or to be exchanged

1077
01:36:05.290 --> 01:36:10.870
David Schaich (he): between the particle in a simple reservoir. And now, in the grand economical case.

1078
01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:15.260
David Schaich (he): you no longer impose conservation of either energy, or.

1079
01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:22.440
David Schaich (he): instead of you fix 2 other quantities through exchange of particles, and he

1080
01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:27.130
David Schaich (he): with a large external

1081
01:36:28.730 --> 01:36:30.260
David Schaich (he): particle reservoir.

1082
01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:46.440
David Schaich (he): So Now, in the

1083
01:36:50.910 --> 01:36:53.050
David Schaich (he): a little while both

1084
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:56.740
David Schaich (he): heat, exchange.

1085
01:36:57.940 --> 01:36:59.790
David Schaich (he): and particle, exchange

1086
01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:09.060
David Schaich (he): and generalize the thermal reservoir that we've been working with for the past few weeks

1087
01:37:13.770 --> 01:37:15.590
David Schaich (he): to a

1088
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:20.070
David Schaich (he): the general particle reservoir.

1089
01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:25.150
David Schaich (he): not real. Ultimately you can serve both

1090
01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:30.870
David Schaich (he): the overall energy of system and the surroundings in line with first law thermodynamics.

1091
01:37:31.090 --> 01:37:34.070
David Schaich (he): and also consider the number of part of this.

1092
01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:40.610
David Schaich (he): and as we that was hinted in the

1093
01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:43.290
David Schaich (he): I Just.

1094
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:47.540
David Schaich (he): and up here to give a qualitative picture.

1095
01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:49.810
David Schaich (he): there will be a corresponding

1096
01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:52.970
David Schaich (he): variable that is going to be fixed

1097
01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:58.820
David Schaich (he): due to this particle change. So, in addition to the temperature.

1098
01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:01.630
David Schaich (he): we will

1099
01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:07.080
David Schaich (he): have a an additional quantity

1100
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:19.030
David Schaich (he): all the way through the derivation of this, just in a couple of minutes that we made.

1101
01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:24.660
David Schaich (he): we call that

1102
01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:38.580
David Schaich (he): allowing key exchange led to a fixed temperature between the and the system. You can recall definition of temperature in the context of

1103
01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:51.090
David Schaich (he): micro- thermodynamic equilibrium related to the response of the entropy to a change in the energy they fixed particle number.

1104
01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:57.950
David Schaich (he): If we swap the rule of energy and particle number.

1105
01:39:00.110 --> 01:39:01.250
David Schaich (he): we get the

1106
01:39:02.630 --> 01:39:03.880
David Schaich (he): definition

1107
01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:06.370
David Schaich (he): of

1108
01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:09.650
David Schaich (he): and quality known as the

1109
01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:13.420
David Schaich (he): chemical potential.

1110
01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:16.190
David Schaich (he): which is this.

1111
01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:19.440
David Schaich (he): into that here.

1112
01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:23.750
David Schaich (he): so that chemical potential

1113
01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:30.500
David Schaich (he): you to be a negative temperature.

1114
01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:43.730
David Schaich (he): How is the response of the entropy? We change in part of the number with the fixed internal entropy. Oh. a micro economical system again in thermodynamic

1115
01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:44.920
David Schaich (he): equilibrium.

1116
01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:53.480
David Schaich (he): And that is it good place to wrap up, or do they define the chemical potential. You

1117
01:39:54.190 --> 01:39:55.760
need to make sense

1118
01:39:55.770 --> 01:39:56.970
David Schaich (he): of what this

1119
01:39:57.130 --> 01:39:59.630
David Schaich (he): equation that means

1120
01:39:59.750 --> 01:40:05.580
David Schaich (he): more conceptual in more physical terms. That's where we will

1121
01:40:05.710 --> 01:40:09.030
David Schaich (he): pick up my after next door. Are there any

1122
01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.250
David Schaich (he): questions before I, that you have often the rest of your day.

1123
01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:26.400
David Schaich (he): not seeing any look forward to seeing you again tomorrow for the Grand Canonical on software

1124
01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:27.890
David Schaich (he): chemical potential.
