1
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.520
David Schaich (he): Well, it's probably time to get underway

2
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.300
David Schaich (he): on Monday morning, the 24th of April.  And the code that just went

3
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:25.320
David Schaich (he): on the board is 6, 6, 3, 2, 8, 6.

4
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.080
David Schaich (he): As a

5
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.790
David Schaich (he): brief logistical remark to get underway, this will be

6
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.740
David Schaich (he): the last Monday morning lecture for a couple of weeks.

7
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.020
David Schaich (he): We have bank holidays next week, the first of May,

8
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.530
David Schaich (he): and then the following week the eighth of May.

9
00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:02.920
David Schaich (he): We have one of those lectures rescheduled to that reading week, the 15th of May.  The other I'll make up

10
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.650
with

11
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.590
David Schaich (he): some recorded pencasts

12
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.320
David Schaich (he): in the time up till then.

13
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.510
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

14
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.190
David Schaich (he): we'll have it somewhat

15
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.220
David Schaich (he): truncated schedule the next couple of weeks. It's based on that.

16
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.700
David Schaich (he): Hopefully, we will not

17
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.170
David Schaich (he): make it more challenging to

18
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.970
David Schaich (he): bye next Wednesday.

19
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.190
David Schaich (he): So

20
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:46.430
David Schaich (he): if there are immediate questions about what we've got up to last week. this is a time to bring them up.

21
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.710
David Schaich (he): and while you think about that? We just

22
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.930
David Schaich (he): the quick recaps remind ourselves where we are and where we are headed.

23
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:11.380
David Schaich (he): We have them looking at ideal quantum gases as a venue for applications. It's the grand canonical ensemble

24
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:25.090
David Schaich (he): that allows both particle, number and energy to fluctuate by exchange with an external particle Reservoir I interact exchanging energy and particles

25
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.700
David Schaich (he): with our system

26
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.970
David Schaich (he): and the quantum gases

27
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.830
David Schaich (he): we're looking at our first of all ideal. They involve non interacting particles for waves that just passed straight through each other and Don't

28
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:53.260
David Schaich (he): interact. and they are based on quantum statistics of 2 different types. The Go design assign a statistics of Bosons which led us to the showtime gas of

29
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.200
David Schaich (he): all the relativistic, massless bosons that we looked at last week driving

30
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.240
David Schaich (he): energy density as a function of frequency. Or

31
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.950
I guess

32
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:18.060
David Schaich (he): let me see. like spectrum. We so provided a good description of photons ranging from

33
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.300
David Schaich (he): high temperature stars to the cool temperature, cosmic, microwave background, despite neglecting

34
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.910
David Schaich (he): all of the interactions that actually give rise to the photons. And then there was systems

35
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.660
David Schaich (he): we found, with the equation stage for leading

36
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.270
David Schaich (he): the large scale quantities of the system, pressure, rolling, temperature and number density.

37
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.890
David Schaich (he): and the familiar form. the same functional form as the ideal gas law

38
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.340
David Schaich (he): back from before the break.

39
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.670
David Schaich (he): just with

40
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.590
David Schaich (he): some

41
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.200
David Schaich (he): a slightly different constant factor.

42
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.040
David Schaich (he): We can boiled down to me a ratio of the functions

43
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.880
David Schaich (he): involving and the purely irrational.

44
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.700
David Schaich (he): We said, Why is this problem

45
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:33.340
David Schaich (he): the effects of relativity as well as the on the nature of that gas, and we wrapped up last Tuesday, and just by beginning

46
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.550
David Schaich (he): a similar look at

47
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.970
David Schaich (he): for me on gas is now with and non-relativistic

48
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.870
David Schaich (he): definition of the energy momentum squared over twice the masses from the ons

49
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.340
David Schaich (he): and we got up to

50
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:50.900
David Schaich (he): was

51
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.120
David Schaich (he): an expression for the grand canonical potential

52
00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.340
David Schaich (he): which

53
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.390
David Schaich (he): now it involves. The mass of these particles, and

54
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.050
David Schaich (he): as well as

55
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.210
David Schaich (he): different combinations of the same

56
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.810
David Schaich (he): sorts of factors.

57
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:20.040
David Schaich (he): The volume and temperature of the system that we saw for the over the energy of the particles.

58
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.180
David Schaich (he): It's strictly positive. Okay.

59
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.280
David Schaich (he): logarithmic factor.

60
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.860
David Schaich (he): Actually, the square root of the energy you

61
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.360
David Schaich (he): and the

62
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.460
David Schaich (he): chemical potential in here that

63
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:50.810
David Schaich (he): we were able to justify setting to 0 for a photon gas. It's based on yeah

64
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:59.120
David Schaich (he): number of to be easy to change that much change in the energy that's no longer the case for these non-relativistic for me, on which

65
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:10.400
David Schaich (he): makes the analysis more complicated. Our economical potential is now a function of the 2 variables t inverse to use Beta as well as that chemical potential.

66
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.580
David Schaich (he): So we're going to want some other simplification to

67
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.240
David Schaich (he): really good. To grip on this in a similar way.

68
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.050
David Schaich (he): plan for today is to

69
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.230
David Schaich (he): push through a similar computation of the equation of state

70
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.990
David Schaich (he): for the normal, optimistic for me on the Us. Considering specifically

71
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.740
David Schaich (he): the regime of low temperatures.

72
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.530
David Schaich (he): we will see how that helps simplify this analysis

73
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:48.640
David Schaich (he): equation of state. I'll just pride to Eos. and then that will probably not take us the full time.

74
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.610
David Schaich (he): and if we have some space in the end.

75
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.310
David Schaich (he): no jump straight into

76
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.330
David Schaich (he): interacting systems. the you

77
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.100
David Schaich (he): last main topic of the module.

78
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.770
David Schaich (he): So a quick check to see if that recap inspired any questions, or they came to mind while I was going through it.

79
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.820
David Schaich (he): and the

80
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.960
David Schaich (he): let's move on to that promised

81
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.460
David Schaich (he): simplification from working

82
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:34.670
David Schaich (he): your temperature Minutes of these non-ultivistic for me on gases which is easiest to see by

83
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:41.680
David Schaich (he): considering one of those thermodynamic quantities that go into the equation of state.

84
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:52.870
David Schaich (he): Look specifically at the number density of the For me. It's pretty good to volume.

85
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.460
David Schaich (he): which, coming from our usual

86
00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:10.730
David Schaich (he): very economical identities, is the derivative of great economical potential. With respect to the chemical potential it's actually. the systems volume just comes along, for the ride

87
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.740
David Schaich (he): cancels out the overall factor of B. Negative signs also cancel.

88
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.230
David Schaich (he): We have the constant factor out front

89
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:29.370
David Schaich (he): integral over energies of the derivative of the log. It's an argument, one

90
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:36.440
David Schaich (he): plus the exponential factor. down into the denominator.

91
00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:39.390
David Schaich (he): And then we change all that.

92
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.360
David Schaich (he): taking the derivative of

93
00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:50.880
David Schaich (he): that arguing with respect to you. we have the exponential factor. Now, with a How's your assignment?

94
00:08:53.150 --> 00:09:03.250
David Schaich (he): And then the new derivative of theta times, e minus mu. thanks as long. Another positive factor of Beta yes.

95
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.600
David Schaich (he): cancels out the temperature.

96
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:11.270
David Schaich (he): I forgot to right now. at the very start of that equation.

97
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:22.000
David Schaich (he): So in the usual way, like we did for the photon. Yes, we can rearrange this by cancelling out, and you know, or dividing through an overall factor of

98
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.960
David Schaich (he): you to the plus data. I'm. C. Minus you.

99
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.660
David Schaich (he): That just gives us

100
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.860
David Schaich (he): it one over that exponential factor.

101
00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.750
David Schaich (he): plus one

102
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.320
David Schaich (he): that should be working down

103
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.460
David Schaich (he): the square root of the de at the end of this.

104
00:09:53.560 --> 00:10:01.270
David Schaich (he): which we can define to be the same way, or a similar way that we did for the

105
00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:06.030
David Schaich (he): like spectrum. When we work with the energy density of the photon gas.

106
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:15.140
David Schaich (he): some function of the times, that square root, he to E.

107
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:21.640
David Schaich (he): And this function it is known as the

108
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:26.110
David Schaich (he): Jeremy direct, or what i'll just call the jeremy function derivative

109
00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.370
David Schaich (he): alliteration.

110
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:35.060
David Schaich (he): It differs from the planck spectrum for the photon energy density by omitting that

111
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.150
David Schaich (he): constant pre-factor that involves.

112
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.490
David Schaich (he): And the reason that is admitted is just to Nick

113
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.340
David Schaich (he): function that we can just read off from those 2 lines.

114
00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.510
David Schaich (he): look

115
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.130
David Schaich (he): more like the

116
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:56.720
David Schaich (he): the

117
00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:03.180
David Schaich (he): average number of fermions. correct

118
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.300
David Schaich (he): energy levels of the average occupation number

119
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.240
David Schaich (he): one of those energy levels.

120
00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.380
David Schaich (he): so

121
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:25.960
David Schaich (he): Mike. the energy levels that we've seen, or the occupation numbers that we've seen for for me, on the energy levels. This is going to range between 0 and one

122
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:37.000
David Schaich (he): 0 away. Yeah. energy level is always unoccupied on average, one that is always occupied in the For you

123
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:44.160
David Schaich (he): make the assumption that the chemical potential is greater than 0,

124
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.620
David Schaich (he): like the energy.

125
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:55.380
David Schaich (he): Then we can see something interesting happening when the energy is equal to the chemical potential. E equals Mu.

126
00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:01.740
David Schaich (he): The argument to the exponential cancels out. We just get e to the 0 is one one over one.

127
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.730
This one

128
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.550
David Schaich (he): is it half all right.

129
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:13.960
David Schaich (he): halfway in between those 2 limits of 0 and one so at

130
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.400
David Schaich (he): very function is simply a half.

131
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:34.910
David Schaich (he): We all been on use of the temperature. I'm calling this threshold because we will have different behavior where he

132
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:40.830
David Schaich (he): is greater than you versus

133
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:54.140
David Schaich (he): in those 2 cases the sign of the argument to the exponential will change. So when he is greater than we. We have the exponential of hey positive number.

134
00:12:54.530 --> 00:13:04.290
David Schaich (he): and as that difference, e minus U gets larger, exponential, becomes larger and larger in the denominator function overall is exponentially

135
00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:13.110
David Schaich (he): excellent. Eventually suppressed. heading toward

136
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.080
David Schaich (he): that

137
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:23.050
David Schaich (he): 0 limit. and when e is less than mu correspondingly we have a negative number.

138
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.330
David Schaich (he): It's similar

139
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.870
David Schaich (he): exponential approach

140
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.570
David Schaich (he): to the opposite limit.

141
00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.410
David Schaich (he): Every function, heading towards maximum value of.

142
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:55.150
David Schaich (he): and the other roofing piece or moving parts. In the pyramid function is Beta, the inverse temperature

143
00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:01.650
David Schaich (he): which has the effect of controlling how quickly these 2 limits

144
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.130
David Schaich (he): are reached

145
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.140
David Schaich (he): as

146
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:23.110
David Schaich (he): the energy and temperature vary. So what we can do to see this more clearly is rearrange the family function to be expressed in terms of

147
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:30.300
David Schaich (he): dimensionless ratios. So if we pull out in the exponential factor

148
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.200
David Schaich (he): at overall. mu divided by.

149
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:44.760
David Schaich (he): we need to cancel out that, mute in the interview terms, we have the ratio of energy

150
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.840
David Schaich (he): over mute minus one

151
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.340
David Schaich (he): plus. One comes along with the ride.

152
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.040
David Schaich (he): and we can use

153
00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:58.660
David Schaich (he): the usual

154
00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.520
David Schaich (he): exponential identities to

155
00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:12.200
David Schaich (he): right the exponential of the product is one of those exponentials raised to the power of the other.

156
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:16.760
David Schaich (he): So this

157
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:26.790
David Schaich (he): they make it easier to see, have those limits of exponential suppression and exponentially approaching the maximum value are realised.

158
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:28.690
David Schaich (he): And also.

159
00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.770
David Schaich (he): should it smaller values of it

160
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:43.080
David Schaich (he): T. Over Mu, the temperature and units of chemical potential will lead to a larger power. Multiplying this exponential factor that is either

161
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.920
David Schaich (he): exactly one at that threshold

162
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:49.880
David Schaich (he): greater than one

163
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.180
David Schaich (he): above the threshold, less than one below the threshold

164
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:58.990
David Schaich (he): where your power is then going to enhance values that you're greater than one

165
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.560
David Schaich (he): extra approach to these that some topic limits

166
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.440
David Schaich (he): just to

167
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.740
David Schaich (he): make it easier to

168
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.480
David Schaich (he): remember. It's a picture we can put up

169
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:29.470
David Schaich (he): that fits in the screen with no need to zoom at this point.

170
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.080
David Schaich (he): So I've taken that fermi function that we derive. We just plug it

171
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:42.440
David Schaich (he): as a function of that ratio energy over chemical potential. I'm: just to mention this in our units 4 4 different values of

172
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.900
David Schaich (he): the ratio of temperature

173
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.590
David Schaich (he): to chemical potential. So

174
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.490
David Schaich (he): you over mute.

175
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.160
David Schaich (he): equal to

176
00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:01.300
David Schaich (he): one for the solid red line that's sort of the

177
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.329
David Schaich (he): slightest, and

178
00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:06.619
David Schaich (he): giving the you

179
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.270
David Schaich (he): taking the longest to go between 0 and one.

180
00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:12.089
Thank you.

181
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:17.720
David Schaich (he): Ultimate minutes that we looked at, as well as to 10,

182
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.800
100 is the

183
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.660
David Schaich (he): to green blue

184
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.990
David Schaich (he): it eventually lacks. So it's. The temperature decreases in terms of the chemical potential.

185
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:33.640
David Schaich (he): like her of skit steeper and steeper around that threshold

186
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:39.470
David Schaich (he): where energy is equal to you. and the function is always equal to

187
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.210
David Schaich (he): precisely one half.

188
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:43.970
David Schaich (he): and

189
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.070
David Schaich (he): in this low temperature limit.

190
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:56.590
David Schaich (he): We can see you from this. Not only this is verify it. The conclusions we were drawing just based on

191
00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:01.660
David Schaich (he): looking at the equation and thinking about it's limits, and how it approaches over limits.

192
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:11.770
David Schaich (he): we can see that we have approximately the formation of the step function in that low temperature limits as t goes to 0,

193
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:20.350
David Schaich (he): you will always have a function of one half by that e equals new at any point to public that reach up immediately

194
00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:22.640
David Schaich (he): down to

195
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.850
David Schaich (he): 0 from the friendly function below it

196
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:31.560
David Schaich (he): we jump up to one. So we're low temperature approximation that

197
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.630
David Schaich (he): is going to

198
00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.760
David Schaich (he): simplify

199
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.180
David Schaich (he): our calculations in this low temperature regime

200
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.660
David Schaich (he): is just to

201
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.840
David Schaich (he): replace the fiery function

202
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.650
David Schaich (he): in our calculations.

203
00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.900
David Schaich (he): And yes, your step function.

204
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.470
David Schaich (he): which is to say.

205
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:13.030
David Schaich (he): set F of the approximately equal to Why not

206
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.470
David Schaich (he): whenever he is less than you.

207
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:27.190
David Schaich (he): Otherwise it is 0. So now, if we look back to the expression we had for the number density.

208
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.210
David Schaich (he): are you writing.

209
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.980
David Schaich (he): If you roll over energy with the fermi function in the square root. LED.

210
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:50.300
David Schaich (he): If we put in this approximation.

211
00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:56.880
David Schaich (he): and the f of the is 0 and kills off all this in tool of E equals to mu

212
00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:01.860
David Schaich (he): what is what he is below you if he is just one and

213
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.650
David Schaich (he): the rest of the control.

214
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.280
David Schaich (he): So we can just

215
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:16.150
David Schaich (he): replace the upper limit of integration from infinity to the chemical potential view.

216
00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:21.970
David Schaich (he): The integral itself is something we know how to do a square root of E.

217
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.110
David Schaich (he): So let's go ahead and do that

218
00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.920
David Schaich (he): the square root

219
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.890
David Schaich (he): when integrated, kicks up to a three-halves power.

220
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:40.960
David Schaich (he): and

221
00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:49.690
David Schaich (he): to remain consistent with the derivative we have the universe of that hour

222
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:56.880
David Schaich (he): coming along as a constant factor. It's evaluated from 0 to M. So we get.

223
00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.470
David Schaich (he): We have factors of 2

224
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:06.880
David Schaich (he): square root of 2 cubed. You also have an Mq.

225
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.680
David Schaich (he): And now I mute the 3 halves.

226
00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:15.550
David Schaich (he): So all of those actors I raised the 3 halves

227
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.140
David Schaich (he): with the denominator just being 3.

228
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.340
David Schaich (he): I square H Bar queued.

229
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:33.640
David Schaich (he): So there is. There are a few interesting things about this result. Be obviously

230
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.910
David Schaich (he): fact of the simplification that we've been able to get

231
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.610
David Schaich (he): from approximately the every function as a step into Google.

232
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.940
David Schaich (he): Sorry a step function in the integral.

233
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:51.710
David Schaich (he): Maybe the most obvious is that there is no longer any temperature unlike what we saw, for

234
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.850
David Schaich (he): it's folks on the

235
00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:00.990
David Schaich (he): where this same number density was proportional to T Qued.

236
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:11.460
David Schaich (he): We should caution that that's not general resolve is what

237
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.280
David Schaich (he): we get just in this low temperature limit.

238
00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:15.910
More generally

239
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:23.230
David Schaich (he): this results. and all the results that we will be getting from our step function, approximation or just

240
00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.610
David Schaich (he): yeah meeting order.

241
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:38.370
David Schaich (he): The full result that would have retain this exponential factor in the integration which we can

242
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.050
David Schaich (he): expand

243
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.900
David Schaich (he): powers of the

244
00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.070
David Schaich (he): small CD. Over mute.

245
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.360
That

246
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.650
David Schaich (he): may well be

247
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.560
David Schaich (he): one of those supplemental Andcasts that

248
00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:59.310
David Schaich (he): we'll be coming out instead of one of the lectures

249
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.170
David Schaich (he): in the next couple of weeks that makes use of

250
00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.550
David Schaich (he): expansion

251
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.000
David Schaich (he): as a way to

252
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.040
David Schaich (he): evaluate those integrals with less extreme approximations.

253
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.800
David Schaich (he): and the place in the and the ocean by the step function.

254
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:35.970
David Schaich (he): Another interesting aspect of this is just the functional dependence on the various quantities we have that Mq. To H. Are huge are coming along on the Grand Canonical potential.

255
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.470
David Schaich (he): the new

256
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:43.300
David Schaich (he): a piece of play. In this result the number density is

257
00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.080
David Schaich (he): the 3 halves power

258
00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:49.560
David Schaich (he): of the chemical potential which we can justify by

259
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.370
David Schaich (he): physical arguments.

260
00:23:52.570 --> 00:24:04.920
David Schaich (he): a mathematical one. So the physical sure that would lead us to this overall functional form

261
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.960
from the

262
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.930
David Schaich (he): housing factors. So we have computed

263
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.780
David Schaich (he): is that in this low temperature limits

264
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:19.280
David Schaich (he): we can recall what we saw. Oh, year 4

265
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:28.930
David Schaich (he): economical spin systems. We talk about the ground state and excited states and the low temperature limit. It was an exponential.

266
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:33.840
David Schaich (he): a strong preference for particles to hang out in the ground states with

267
00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:40.450
David Schaich (he): the occupation of higher energy states exponentially suppressed by Boltzmann factor.

268
00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.250
David Schaich (he): In this case it's fermions.

269
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:53.210
David Schaich (he): The most energy levels can only hold a single fermion. and any additional fermions beyond that have to

270
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:56.620
David Schaich (he): go in and fill up higher energy levels.

271
00:24:58.090 --> 00:24:59.650
David Schaich (he): all of which will

272
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:11.060
David Schaich (he): be occupied up until that threshold we saw in the fermi function. So all energy levels with the energy less than you.

273
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.350
David Schaich (he): You have the

274
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.700
David Schaich (he): maximum occupation number for fermions

275
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.940
David Schaich (he): and all of the energy levels

276
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:27.120
David Schaich (he): with you about me, and this low temperature minutes will be empty or unoccupied.

277
00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:34.030
David Schaich (he): So we can call

278
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.710
David Schaich (he): that the energies we have for these energy levels

279
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:44.060
David Schaich (he): are proportional to a square, the inner product of that integer 3. Vector

280
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:50.440
David Schaich (he): So when we I to count the overall number of particles per unit volume.

281
00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.710
David Schaich (he): that number is really filling

282
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.090
the

283
00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.720
David Schaich (he): positive options.

284
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.270
David Schaich (he): So part of the here.

285
00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:14.480
David Schaich (he): If the reading is given by. so the the energy is less than Mu and K squared

286
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:19.710
David Schaich (he): it's related to the square root of view. So

287
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:33.250
David Schaich (he): the overall number is given by something. so it's proportional to our queue, which is

288
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.650
David Schaich (he): this is

289
00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:38.600
David Schaich (he): again a picture of

290
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:47.070
David Schaich (he): what's going on graphically rather than absolutely in terms of integrals.

291
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:52.110
David Schaich (he): The textbook I took this from through this introduction to thermal physics uses.

292
00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:59.340
David Schaich (he): and rather than our K or yeah integer vector

293
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.490
David Schaich (he): all of the

294
00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:08.860
David Schaich (he): energy levels themselves are given by these dots. So integer values of

295
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:17.030
David Schaich (he): Yeah. hey? On one to infinity, in just the positive options

296
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:22.320
David Schaich (he): of this 3 here. So we see that this queue, but then all those energy levels fall into.

297
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:31.630
David Schaich (he): He is founded by the X Y. And Z, and so only positive numbers are contributing and

298
00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.070
David Schaich (he): based on the approximation that we have

299
00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:41.570
David Schaich (he): an extremely large number of these energy levels extremely close to space, we can approximate it

300
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.910
David Schaich (he): all those discrete points. our purposes of easy integration. I. This

301
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:52.070
David Schaich (he): it to the here in the sphere of the coordinates

302
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.440
David Schaich (he): which has just led to us.

303
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:58.090
David Schaich (he): adding in some of this

304
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:59.910
David Schaich (he): extra

305
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:10.060
David Schaich (he): space between this year and the energy levels themselves.

306
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.990
David Schaich (he): It looks like a poor approximation in this plot, just because

307
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:26.110
David Schaich (he): this is considering so few statements. When we get up to things like avagado's, number our usual domain or statistical physics. The error of this approximation gets down to

308
00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:30.950
David Schaich (he): the usual sorts of things like one part intend to be power 20

309
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.250
the previous of this year

310
00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:35.910
David Schaich (he): is

311
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.870
David Schaich (he): you can buy this. hey, Max

312
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.940
David Schaich (he): proportional to

313
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.700
David Schaich (he): square root of the energy

314
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.520
David Schaich (he): square root of new. and that is

315
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.150
David Schaich (he): where we are getting the volume.

316
00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.340
David Schaich (he): The free powers of that

317
00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:12.600
David Schaich (he): you in

318
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.620
David Schaich (he): all right approximate.

319
00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:18.650
David Schaich (he): I calculated results.

320
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.310
David Schaich (he): And

321
00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.100
David Schaich (he): this energy.

322
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:33.870
David Schaich (he): the threshold that is being set by the chemical potential. Here you see, it corresponds to the

323
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:38.780
David Schaich (he): the maximum energy. That's the for me as an individual. For me it has

324
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:45.890
David Schaich (he): in this non-relativistic no temperature gas in particular the 0. Temperature with it

325
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.730
David Schaich (he): this maximum energy

326
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.590
David Schaich (he): of an individual particle

327
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:02.360
David Schaich (he): is defined to be something called Germany energy.

328
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.990
So

329
00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.800
David Schaich (he): an E. With a capital F subscript

330
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:14.830
David Schaich (he): which in the 0 temperature limits is equal to the chemical potential that we can

331
00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:20.460
David Schaich (he): relate to the number density by inverting it. Just the quality. Thank you.

332
00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:27.780
David Schaich (he): Each bar and 3 pi square that

333
00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:36.590
David Schaich (he): go into the numerator. When we take the two-thirds power and h bar queue converts to

334
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:43.150
David Schaich (he): and H. Bar squared i'll keep the perhaps power explicit.

335
00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:54.140
David Schaich (he): The 3 pi squared and then 2 new Sorry to M.

336
00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.140
David Schaich (he): Comes to the wall for the ride.

337
00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:05.620
David Schaich (he): so we have the maximum energy.

338
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:13.190
David Schaich (he): I'll be you for me on in the 0 temperature limit given by the two-thirds power of the number of decades

339
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.940
David Schaich (he): of those. And this relation with

340
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:23.970
David Schaich (he): the chemical potential this quality is again something that only holds in that 0 temperature limit

341
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:29.040
David Schaich (he): and the Z over the expansion of the full integral

342
00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.140
David Schaich (he): involved in. Do you

343
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:38.170
David Schaich (he): exponential factor in the fairly function. gives us corrections to that that breaks this equality.

344
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:39.720
David Schaich (he): and leads to

345
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.010
David Schaich (he): corrections to.

346
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.170
David Schaich (he): or differences between, that chemical potential and

347
00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:52.940
David Schaich (he): every energy which we roll get to a bit later on. Or now

348
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.400
David Schaich (he): also to see if there are questions about the

349
00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:03.020
David Schaich (he): calculate, the approximation, the calculation, or physical interpretation

350
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:04.840
David Schaich (he): that we've called through

351
00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.900
David Schaich (he): it's keeping involved.

352
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:27.960
David Schaich (he): keeping in mind or goal of given to the equation of state. Yeah. A few more pieces to relates to

353
00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:30.650
David Schaich (he): just the number

354
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:35.410
David Schaich (he): up for me on the screen canonical calculation.

355
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:37.920
David Schaich (he): and

356
00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:46.220
David Schaich (he): the next on the we can look at is actually the one we started off with for the photon gas.

357
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.390
David Schaich (he): That is the

358
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:57.340
David Schaich (he): internal energy

359
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:00.580
David Schaich (he): which

360
00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:10.140
David Schaich (he): you look at from very similar calculation as the number density. So I remember pointing out last week

361
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:16.020
David Schaich (he): that in the case of the photon gas

362
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:30.180
David Schaich (he): computations that we did first to produce the planning spectrum, and then to derive the equation of state. The you number of photons involved the integral

363
00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:38.940
David Schaich (he): over something that looked almost like the like spectrum, but different from it by a factor of H. Bar Omega.

364
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:43.750
David Schaich (he): which was just the energy of individual photon.

365
00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.000
David Schaich (he): which is a

366
00:33:50.170 --> 00:34:01.820
David Schaich (he): natural wait for things to be organized if we reflect on that. So, rather than charging through and taking the derivative of the or economical potential

367
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:04.520
David Schaich (he): with respect to temperature that would

368
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.020
David Schaich (he): reduce the

369
00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:14.000
David Schaich (he): internal energy expectation value for us. We can reflect this, and we argue

370
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:22.100
David Schaich (he): more conceptually that the energy density should just be given by the number of particles

371
00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:27.929
David Schaich (he): with a given energy. So. in addition to counting the number of particles over

372
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:32.040
David Schaich (he): any range in energy integrating over that.

373
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:37.960
David Schaich (he): we should wait that number by a factor of the energy in our integrals

374
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:44.989
David Schaich (he): which then just picks up an extra factor right

375
00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.719
David Schaich (he): of the energy there.

376
00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:52.400
David Schaich (he): Again, prior to

377
00:34:53.860 --> 00:35:03.300
David Schaich (he): integrating. which is to say that. compared to the number, density, the internal energy, density per unit volume.

378
00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.160
David Schaich (he): as everything the

379
00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:16.850
David Schaich (he): seen, as we found about before integrating just with that extra EU in front of the very functioning

380
00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.100
David Schaich (he): which.

381
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:26.180
David Schaich (he): if we now I can apply our step function, approximation to the primary function

382
00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:28.430
David Schaich (he): that will kill off

383
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.670
David Schaich (he): everything in this

384
00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:44.040
David Schaich (he): integral, larger for energy is larger than the chemical potential new. and what will be left is 3 half hours of the energy to integrate.

385
00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:50.100
David Schaich (he): which, instead of bringing in a two-thirds, now brings in

386
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:51.690
David Schaich (he): 2 fits.

387
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:58.330
David Schaich (he): So that same factor of 2 that gives us a

388
00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.700
David Schaich (he): 2 times mass times chemical potential to the 3 house power.

389
00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:12.790
David Schaich (he): We have either the 5 hands evaluated at view as an extra factor of you to get a total of 5 halves. There

390
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.130
David Schaich (he): you can have a 5 rather than 3.

391
00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:20.340
David Schaich (he): Multiplying the I squared H bar cubed.

392
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.110
David Schaich (he): and that's

393
00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:29.300
David Schaich (he): that is the result which. written in this way is clearly

394
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:32.040
David Schaich (he): proportional to the number, density

395
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.380
David Schaich (he): and the proportionality factor just being

396
00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:40.480
David Schaich (he): 8 3 2,

397
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:47.050
David Schaich (he): it's 5 to replace it. the overall factor of chemical essential.

398
00:36:48.050 --> 00:37:02.430
David Schaich (he): and then everything else is a result for the number density so canceling it the density we have it. As for the photon gas, a relation between

399
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.560
David Schaich (he): the internal energy. And

400
00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.020
David Schaich (he): now i'm relativistic for me on number.

401
00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:11.160
David Schaich (he): and in particular. If we

402
00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.260
David Schaich (he): divide

403
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:19.100
David Schaich (he): through that for me on number. we can

404
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:22.640
David Schaich (he): find the

405
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:28.440
David Schaich (he): average energy per particle in the 0 temperature limits.

406
00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:35.990
David Schaich (he): So energy

407
00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.960
David Schaich (he): average over the

408
00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:51.130
David Schaich (he): number of particles is just the meaning factor. Three-fifths times the chemical potential view which in the 0 temperature is

409
00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:52.990
David Schaich (he): that fairly function.

410
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.410
David Schaich (he): So

411
00:37:56.010 --> 00:38:03.190
David Schaich (he): we have seen not only that the maximum value of the energy in this low temperature for me on gas

412
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:06.040
David Schaich (he): is given by the fermi energy

413
00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:11.400
David Schaich (he): related to the two-thirds power of the particle number density.

414
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:22.830
David Schaich (he): average energy from all of those formulas that are steadily filling up every single energy level. Up to that the energy is

415
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:26.860
David Schaich (he): just a little over one half of the value of the maximum.

416
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.320
David Schaich (he): So that's

417
00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.470
David Schaich (he): telling us for basically extracting the problem

418
00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:44.950
David Schaich (he): information about how the energy laws are very for the

419
00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:49.570
David Schaich (he): definition of the energy proportional to K. Squared. It's not

420
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:53.040
David Schaich (he): just a uniform function of K squared that would give

421
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:57.260
David Schaich (he): and energy of exactly half the maximum. On average.

422
00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:02.360
David Schaich (he): there's a good You' to it for more generally curvature.

423
00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:07.040
David Schaich (he): so that we end up with an average a little over half

424
00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.370
David Schaich (he): of the maximum.

425
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:19.940
David Schaich (he): So there's

426
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:25.140
David Schaich (he): just a couple more steps to the equation of States

427
00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.840
David Schaich (he): may well be able to

428
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:41.120
David Schaich (he): before taking a brief break. Are there questions about the internal energy or the computation? The average energy we have gone through for this low temperature

429
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:42.920
David Schaich (he): simplifies limit

430
00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.390
David Schaich (he): to keeping those results in mind.

431
00:39:54.410 --> 00:40:00.160
David Schaich (he): There is a little more that we can say about that physical picture of

432
00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:02.550
David Schaich (he): for me on this

433
00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:05.480
David Schaich (he): building up every energy level

434
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:08.910
David Schaich (he): due to the quality, exclusion principle.

435
00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.930
David Schaich (he): Perhaps the

436
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.770
David Schaich (he): most obvious consequence of this, which

437
00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:35.960
David Schaich (he): I should point out explicitly, is the fact that the energy

438
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.990
David Schaich (he): of this gas remains

439
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:41.630
David Schaich (he): non-zero, or even as

440
00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:46.610
David Schaich (he): temperature goes to 0. So that's very different both from the classical

441
00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:50.520
David Schaich (he): canonical, no more optimistic ideal gas that we looked at

442
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:53.860
David Schaich (he): earlier in the term

443
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.440
David Schaich (he): energy, which is 3 halves times the glum of particles times the temperature

444
00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:07.060
David Schaich (he): vanishes as the temperature vanishes with the proton gas. It was even more dramatic. The particle number itself vanished

445
00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.340
David Schaich (he): like the temperature tube.

446
00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:20.900
David Schaich (he): the energy advantage like temperature to the fourth power very highly suppressed. Hello, temperatures here, thanks to poly exclusion that is forcing fermions to fill energy levels

447
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:30.020
David Schaich (he): with non-zero energies up to that maximum of the fermi energy, and on average. 60 of the fermi energy. We keep

448
00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:35.500
David Schaich (he): a non-zero value of the energy and the limit of absolute 0 temperature.

449
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.540
David Schaich (he): But there's also

450
00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:43.660
David Schaich (he): gives us a justification

451
00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:47.690
David Schaich (he): or a assumption that I made that

452
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:56.170
David Schaich (he): you didn't feel like challenging me on in the

453
00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:10.050
David Schaich (he): look at the Jeremy function that we did to justify its approximation by a step function. I started at all by it, saying that. Yeah.

454
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.060
David Schaich (he): we were assuming a positive chemical potential

455
00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:19.280
David Schaich (he): that I did not emphasize there. I would not remind you there that this is

456
00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:22.850
David Schaich (he): not what we might have expected, coming out of our work on the

457
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:38.120
David Schaich (he): those on to general. when we saw that in order for the Geometric series to converge and give us the those I've assigned. Grand Canonical partition function and the potential for which everything else was

458
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:44.670
David Schaich (he): determine we needed to have. Do you look being less than

459
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:50.100
David Schaich (he): any energy? And in general you is less than 0

460
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:59.540
David Schaich (he): just coming from his definition in the Grand Canonical potential as the

461
00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:06.400
David Schaich (he): variation and the energy that's required to be able to add or remove particles while keeping the

462
00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:07.960
David Schaich (he): interview fixed.

463
00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:13.520
David Schaich (he): But with this picture of poly exclusion leading to

464
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:17.760
David Schaich (he): all of the energy levels being filled up to the

465
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:21.070
David Schaich (he): you can

466
00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:26.550
David Schaich (he): justify after the fact. power.

467
00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:29.110
David Schaich (he): Earlier assumption that

468
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:33.720
David Schaich (he): view is the chemical potential is

469
00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.600
David Schaich (he): positive, at least 4

470
00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.820
David Schaich (he): for me on gases below temperature limits.

471
00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:51.700
David Schaich (he): So we have. That new is the response of the energy to a change in the particle number.

472
00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:55.110
David Schaich (he): While keeping an entropy and voting fixed.

473
00:43:56.770 --> 00:44:01.610
David Schaich (he): And in this low temperature you going to 0, where we have

474
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:05.550
David Schaich (he): every energy level filled up to the fermi energy.

475
00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:09.420
David Schaich (he): every energy level with a higher energy unoccupied.

476
00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:17.860
David Schaich (he): We just well, that is the one and only

477
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.300
David Schaich (he): microstates that the system can have

478
00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:27.060
David Schaich (he): everyone.

479
00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.430
David Schaich (he): no other

480
00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.580
David Schaich (he): options.

481
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:38.860
David Schaich (he): and with a single energy

482
00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.970
David Schaich (he): that has 100% probability.

483
00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:49.830
David Schaich (he): We call our general expression for the entropy to some

484
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:53.060
David Schaich (he): over all of those microstates

485
00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.250
David Schaich (he): walk of those probabilities.

486
00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:01.750
David Schaich (he): and that just equals

487
00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.620
David Schaich (he): 0. When

488
00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:09.310
David Schaich (he): there's a single microstate with 100% probability

489
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:10.950
David Schaich (he): in particular.

490
00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.100
David Schaich (he): that's

491
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.960
David Schaich (he): entropy remains. Cost is

492
00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.730
David Schaich (he): even if we add

493
00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.630
David Schaich (he): particles

494
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:31.390
David Schaich (he): to the system. We always have a single micro stage.

495
00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:32.420
David Schaich (he): really

496
00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:34.950
David Schaich (he): a number of particles

497
00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:42.000
David Schaich (he): changing the energy level and the fermi energy shifts to a higher energy level as any additional particles

498
00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.920
David Schaich (he): are added to

499
00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:50.960
David Schaich (he): more of those energy levels. their maximum occupation number. So for you

500
00:45:55.260 --> 00:46:07.650
David Schaich (he): have some positive increase in the number of particles. The only place they can go is to the energy level is immediately above. If you any energy. the initial fermi energy they fill those

501
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.140
David Schaich (he): and shit

502
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:13.070
David Schaich (he): the grabbing energy to

503
00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:18.990
David Schaich (he): the next higher level.

504
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:25.750
David Schaich (he): seeing that the energy is equal to M for

505
00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:28.890
David Schaich (he): the 0 temperature limit.

506
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.880
David Schaich (he): and if we add some number of particles.

507
00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:45.620
David Schaich (he): the energies around this changing the energy is just going to be. You got her. She calls each of those new particles times the number of particles that we have

508
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:49.520
David Schaich (he): also greater than 0. See that

509
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:54.670
David Schaich (he): that response and 0 temperatures, for here is just equal to view

510
00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:56.700
David Schaich (he): It's giving us new equals new.

511
00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:03.660
David Schaich (he): but in general a positive increase in response to a positive change to particle number.

512
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:09.180
David Schaich (he): So it you greater than 0, as we assumed earlier.

513
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:13.900
David Schaich (he): and we know that and higher temperatures.

514
00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:20.820
David Schaich (he): Eventually

515
00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:23.950
David Schaich (he): we will

516
00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:28.080
David Schaich (he): you back to the high temperature classical limit

517
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:29.650
David Schaich (he): of this low temperature.

518
00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:44.270
David Schaich (he): Very direct distribution Conversions with the Bose-einstein Distribution of the Maxwell. Ultimate distribution coming from classical calculations. Yeah. Requires the chemical potential

519
00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:48.360
David Schaich (he): running off to very large negative numbers.

520
00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:50.230
David Schaich (he): And

521
00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.560
David Schaich (he): this is

522
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:03.420
David Schaich (he): something that we can see happening

523
00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:07.850
David Schaich (he): through the same sorts of expansions.

524
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:11.540
David Schaich (he): Some of the overall expansions mentioned earlier.

525
00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:23.910
David Schaich (he): and that is going to the I'm. Not discussed today, like in the last few months supplemental

526
00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:37.540
David Schaich (he): recording will be able to confirm. But this is the case. The kind of a potential changes positive to negative as the temperature increases and move away from

527
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:41.210
David Schaich (he): the step function approximation for it

528
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:47.020
David Schaich (he): very function.

529
00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:51.860
David Schaich (he): So

530
00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:06.950
David Schaich (he): we still have one last step to get the equation of States. But

531
00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:14.900
David Schaich (he): even the time it gets worthwhile to take a bit of a break before going through that it'll take just a few more minutes.

532
00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:22.700
David Schaich (he): Are there any questions about this low temperature

533
00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.080
David Schaich (he): system, and it's

534
00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:34.570
David Schaich (he): essentially unusual behavior with a single microstate. Before I pause the recording and take the 10 min break

535
00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:38.150
David Schaich (he): until 100'clock.

536
00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:43.420
David Schaich (he): Not seeing any. I will

537
00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.070
David Schaich (he): pause things and reconvene in 10 min.

538
00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:01.290
David Schaich (he): All right.

539
00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.220
David Schaich (he): I didn't you get back in your way?

540
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:08.220
David Schaich (he): I can make

541
00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:15.220
David Schaich (he): going away any questions occur during that.

542
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:19.650
David Schaich (he): It's not. We can

543
00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:25.070
David Schaich (he): turn to the last piece of the

544
00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:30.840
David Schaich (he): and our usual Pv. Equals. and t so he

545
00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:33.960
David Schaich (he): you see you

546
00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:41.560
David Schaich (he): for sure i'm just for you on gas that we want to determine from that usual relation between

547
00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:46.300
David Schaich (he): the pressure and the response.

548
00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:58.010
David Schaich (he): the internal energy to a change in the volume. while keeping the number of particles. The entropy you of that for me, I guess, fixed.

549
00:50:59.260 --> 00:50:59.910
David Schaich (he): and

550
00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:09.710
David Schaich (he): the energy is just needed to

551
00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:18.870
David Schaich (he): particle number itself with that. A real factor of 3 fifths times the chemical potential

552
00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.610
David Schaich (he): here and is fixed.

553
00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:31.280
David Schaich (he): And if we again consider the we'll take a few minutes. we will have an easy way to

554
00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:33.690
David Schaich (he): fix the entropy as

555
00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:34.380
David Schaich (he): you.

556
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:40.830
David Schaich (he): So, as in our considerations above

557
00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:45.040
David Schaich (he): justifying the positive chemical potential

558
00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:48.610
David Schaich (he): low temperatures.

559
00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.690
David Schaich (he): it's your temperature limits.

560
00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:57.250
David Schaich (he): You've set single microstates you described

561
00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.310
David Schaich (he): with all energy levels up to the fermi energy field

562
00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:06.900
David Schaich (he): on under she levels above the fermi energy empty.

563
00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:12.950
David Schaich (he): therefore, with single microstate, with a 100%

564
00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:18.800
David Schaich (he): it's the constant entropy of 0.

565
00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:23.250
David Schaich (he): No matter what we do to the volume, I think, fixed

566
00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:24.840
David Schaich (he): for me on number.

567
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.600
David Schaich (he): The non-trivial aspect of this relation is how

568
00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:35.070
David Schaich (he): that chemical potential depends on the volume.

569
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:36.780
David Schaich (he): So

570
00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:42.390
David Schaich (he): the first half of today I computed

571
00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:48.790
David Schaich (he): very energy that's equal to the chemical potential in this low temperature

572
00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:55.220
David Schaich (he): in terms out of the year.

573
00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.400
David Schaich (he): average number density so i'm building

574
00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:00.680
David Schaich (he): the potential

575
00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:07.610
David Schaich (he): that we are taking the derivative of that it's all we used to be a two-thirds power.

576
00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:09.840
David Schaich (he): So

577
00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:20.140
David Schaich (he): the pressure that results from what we've already computed in slow temperature limits

578
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:24.110
David Schaich (he): has

579
00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.260
David Schaich (he): all of these factors together. The 3 fifths

580
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:37.260
David Schaich (he): h bar squared, over 2 m.

581
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:40.830
David Schaich (he): 3 pi squared to the two-thirds

582
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:48.450
David Schaich (he): article number raised to two-thirds, plus one

583
00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:49.210
is

584
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:54.720
David Schaich (he): 5 thirds power. Finally, the one over the

585
00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:05.350
David Schaich (he): it should be two-thirds dependence on the volume. It's a simple derivative that brings down negative

586
00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:08.670
David Schaich (he): two-thirds times one over V.

587
00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:10.510
David Schaich (he): Reduce the power.

588
00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:15.080
David Schaich (he): Okay by one is

589
00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:23.850
David Schaich (he): the negative cancel out. We have 2 of the 3, the times all of those other factors which we

590
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.610
David Schaich (he): just got from the energy itself.

591
00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:29.550
So.

592
00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:39.080
David Schaich (he): not bothering to rewrite all of that, but just identifying it with the energy we started off with it. You you have 3

593
00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:44.850
David Schaich (he): relations for pressure in terms of either

594
00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:50.950
David Schaich (he): internal energy particle number or particle density.

595
00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:55.950
David Schaich (he): So

596
00:54:58.250 --> 00:55:08.460
David Schaich (he): the first one that we have here it's just that the pressure is two-thirds the average internal energy density.

597
00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:10.850
David Schaich (he): If we

598
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:17.780
David Schaich (he): plug in the relation we started off with between yeah energy and

599
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:19.560
David Schaich (he): number

600
00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:22.290
David Schaich (he): at two-thirds times 3 halves will

601
00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:31.190
David Schaich (he): actually they can't solely the two-fifths you know role factor in the potential. And then do you article number yesterday?

602
00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:36.460
David Schaich (he): And if we insert our mew and evolves a

603
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:39.320
David Schaich (he): two-thirds power of that number density.

604
00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.810
David Schaich (he): pick up

605
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:51.990
David Schaich (he): well 2 fifths over 2. It's one, fifth times that H. Bar squared over the M. H. 4 squared over 5 and

606
00:55:53.260 --> 00:56:00.190
David Schaich (he): 3 pi squared, and the 2 first power. and then again 5 through its powers of

607
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:03.170
David Schaich (he): at number, density and average over

608
00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:08.600
David Schaich (he): all right as a new

609
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:11.650
David Schaich (he): variable row with the density.

610
00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.200
David Schaich (he): This is the 5 through its power.

611
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:16.920
Hopefully, I

612
00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:22.170
David Schaich (he): right roads and P. Sufficiently distinctly

613
00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:25.830
David Schaich (he): to make it clear which is which.

614
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:31.640
David Schaich (he): This density row is just the average particle number

615
00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:34.880
David Schaich (he): 3. The following that gets raised in 5 through is power.

616
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.030
David Schaich (he): and the results for the pressure. So

617
00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:45.830
David Schaich (he): we have several ways of expressing the pressure.

618
00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:49.480
David Schaich (he): none of which depend on the temperature in this limit.

619
00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:58.630
David Schaich (he): so there he is. nothing resembling it. The ideal gas and functional form, unlike the photographs.

620
00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:05.000
David Schaich (he): and not surprisingly, Given the direct relation between pressure and average internal energy.

621
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:07.000
David Schaich (he): they will have

622
00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:10.210
David Schaich (he): the same

623
00:57:14.310 --> 00:57:17.220
David Schaich (he): non-zero limits

624
00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:20.670
David Schaich (he): 4 0 temperatures

625
00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:26.390
David Schaich (he): which we Don't have for

626
00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:37.600
David Schaich (he): ev equals. and t from the ideal gas law. What do you variance of that? What we derived for the

627
00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:45.990
David Schaich (he): this non-zero pressure is Oh, perhaps confusingly

628
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.700
David Schaich (he): generous and pressure?

629
00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:54.530
David Schaich (he): We're

630
00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:57.880
David Schaich (he): this term degeneracy.

631
00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.890
David Schaich (he): It's confusing because it doesn't actually have to do with

632
00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:16.580
David Schaich (he): multiple energy levels with the same value of the energy. What we need defined to be to general energy levels last week. This is some more. some of the obscure historical

633
00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:23.330
David Schaich (he): convention calling the non-zero pressure with the low temperature, family gas.

634
00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:27.640
David Schaich (he): the degeneracy pressure of the

635
00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:33.420
David Schaich (he): your degeneracy is referring to all of those energy levels being filled, even though they have

636
00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:36.270
David Schaich (he): for energies to the same border with

637
00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:37.810
David Schaich (he): 2 different meetings

638
00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:41.190
David Schaich (he): just from the historical development.

639
00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:44.890
David Schaich (he): and it's worth emphasizing that this pressure

640
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:49.840
David Schaich (he): is not actually coming from direct interactions or forces

641
00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:56.070
David Schaich (he): between those fermions, but from again the poly exclusion principle that

642
00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:59.000
David Schaich (he): forces

643
00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:01.660
David Schaich (he): it requires rather than

644
00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:04.180
being a force. It requires

645
00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:09.120
David Schaich (he): the the electrons or the fermions in

646
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:15.800
David Schaich (he): this gas to occupy different energy levels. It's not coming from

647
00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:21.220
David Schaich (he): the force between

648
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:24.470
David Schaich (he): those fermions.

649
00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:38.170
David Schaich (he): And if you get that. consider this result just as a limit of more complicated temperature dependence, we can jump back to the classical limit

650
00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:43.750
David Schaich (he): we are. We should expect to recover the classical. Id. You will get a small

651
00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:45.080
David Schaich (he): that we

652
00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:49.000
David Schaich (he): previously derived in that limit.

653
00:59:57.330 --> 01:00:02.850
David Schaich (he): So as the temperature increases away from the regime that we've been analyzing here.

654
01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:17.420
David Schaich (he): you would expect the pressure to eventually take the Forum of Mt or V, which we can repackage, is it has the row times to you.

655
01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.290
David Schaich (he): and a numerical evaluation of

656
01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:36.510
David Schaich (he): the full pressure of a non-relativistic for me on gas and great economic. This curve which, by the I thought code for it is

657
01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:40.330
David Schaich (he): in the repository for this module.

658
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:44.220
David Schaich (he): where we can see the smooth

659
01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:47.690
David Schaich (he): interpolation between these 2 limits that

660
01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:58.400
David Schaich (he): you've been considering. Foresee low temperature limits. Going to t. Going to 0 is pressure in arbitrary units

661
01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:01.800
David Schaich (he): does not go to 0, but flatten out into

662
01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:06.880
David Schaich (he): it's constant degeneracy pressure that so

663
01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.680
David Schaich (he): we just derived. It depends

664
01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:17.520
David Schaich (he): on the 5 through it. These new variable factors that

665
01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.330
David Schaich (he): convert through a place costed from a number density to

666
01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.820
David Schaich (he): the pressure of force per unit area.

667
01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:32.090
David Schaich (he): The other limit of high temperatures. Where we recover

668
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:40.670
David Schaich (he): classical statistics from the underlying.

669
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:42.680
David Schaich (he): Also

670
01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.500
David Schaich (he): we have the I of us now.

671
01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:49.220
David Schaich (he): P. Is

672
01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:57.100
David Schaich (he): proportionally to the temperature, so it turns from the constant to a straight line. some curvature in between.

673
01:01:57.450 --> 01:01:59.510
David Schaich (he): and the slope

674
01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.350
David Schaich (he): of. That

675
01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:08.740
David Schaich (he): is just the density of the number density of the

676
01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.700
Let me

677
01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.820
David Schaich (he): precise computation of how

678
01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:33.960
David Schaich (he): the pressure turns over from that cost it's degeneracy. Pressure to the high temperature. Ideal gas now is another thing that can be computed systematically in

679
01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.880
David Schaich (he): extensions. In that low temperature

680
01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:49.950
David Schaich (he): you relative to the chemical potential for you. We will not do so here and now. It's gonna be both. Look at a consequence of this mole. Is your pressure

681
01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:51.780
David Schaich (he): at low temperatures

682
01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:01.290
David Schaich (he): connected to. and some interesting

683
01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:03.530
David Schaich (he): physics related to.

684
01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.920
David Schaich (he): the evolution of the universe.

685
01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:10.290
David Schaich (he): should have plenty of time to get through that. Are there questions about

686
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:18.520
David Schaich (he): low temperature. Turn me on. Yes, pressure before we talk about super yours.

687
01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:37.020
David Schaich (he): feel free to jump into questions do occur. I will move on if I,

688
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:42.940
David Schaich (he): emphasizing that the calculations we've been doing

689
01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:47.490
David Schaich (he): things like this Degeneracy pressure

690
01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.170
David Schaich (he): don't require in general exactly

691
01:03:54.380 --> 01:04:00.940
David Schaich (he): 0 temperature. That's the limit where we've been working, but that limit remains a good approximation.

692
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.720
David Schaich (he): so more as the temperature is relatively small

693
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:14.980
David Schaich (he): in question, relatively small, relative to what. as it's in that, things like this

694
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:23.410
David Schaich (he): degeneracy pressure. the color significant

695
01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:33.120
David Schaich (he): when the temperature is small relative to yeah, fairly energy.

696
01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.400
David Schaich (he): Even if

697
01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:40.340
David Schaich (he): that temperature is non-zero, it might look

698
01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:44.370
David Schaich (he): relatively large by our everyday standards.

699
01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:50.570
David Schaich (he): We can recall that that Germany energy is equal to the chemical potential in the limit of 0 temperature.

700
01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.450
David Schaich (he): but that

701
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:57.740
David Schaich (he): equality is broken at higher temperatures where it is the

702
01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:09.220
David Schaich (he): every energy itself that matters, and that sets the average energy of the fermions and the it has to. They fill the energy levels up to every surface.

703
01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.470
David Schaich (he): and we saw

704
01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:15.230
David Schaich (he): earlier on this result

705
01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.300
David Schaich (he): that this fairly energy is proportionate.

706
01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:24.960
David Schaich (he): 2 particle number des to be to the 2 thirds

707
01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:29.130
David Schaich (he): power. So we're going to be 2 thirds. So

708
01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:32.800
David Schaich (he): we have one of your densities

709
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:40.690
David Schaich (he): larger. The energy is not surprisingly. There are more

710
01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:46.070
David Schaich (he): to, you know, more energy levels up to higher values of the energy

711
01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.540
David Schaich (he): set by that 2 through its power

712
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:52.300
David Schaich (he): which will allow our calculations to be

713
01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.800
David Schaich (he): valid and good approximations.

714
01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:57.230
David Schaich (he): 4 larger temperatures

715
01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.550
David Schaich (he): so too orient ourselves with

716
01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:03.420
David Schaich (he): concrete physical applications

717
01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:08.720
David Schaich (he): of these calculations. If we look first at

718
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:13.800
David Schaich (he): every the materials and specifically

719
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.560
David Schaich (he): metals that

720
01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:19.720
David Schaich (he): allow electrical current to

721
01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.510
David Schaich (he): I conduct

722
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:28.610
David Schaich (he): That current is carried by. What are we conducting electrons that behave like a gas?

723
01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:33.650
David Schaich (he): They are not tied to individual atoms in this metal, but they are free to

724
01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:36.010
David Schaich (he): move around

725
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:40.320
David Schaich (he): the the metal and carry that flow of electric currents

726
01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:45.640
David Schaich (he): and typical metals have in round numbers

727
01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:49.860
David Schaich (he): how we got those number worth of conducting electrons.

728
01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.050
David Schaich (he): cubic centimeter.

729
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:56.040
David Schaich (he): So for you

730
01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:03.340
David Schaich (he): plug in those numbers. How they got those numbers up 10 to the 23

731
01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:09.260
David Schaich (he): for cubic centimeter, and we can convert

732
01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.470
David Schaich (he): centimeters, 2 meters

733
01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:16.860
David Schaich (he): by a factor of a 100 cube. That gives us 10 to the 6,

734
01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:23.170
David Schaich (he): multiplying 10 to the 3 is overall about 10 to the how we're 20 million.

735
01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:30.490
David Schaich (he): Nothing electron on this per cubic meter I mean typical metal and

736
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:35.510
David Schaich (he): plugging in the constants and the relation between

737
01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.600
David Schaich (he): and density to

738
01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:53.500
David Schaich (he): get a value for the fairy energy. I just tell you. is at the order of magnitude, corresponding to 10 to 29 electrons per cubic meter.

739
01:07:54.080 --> 01:08:06.250
David Schaich (he): It's fairly energy roughly into the fourth kilo. You're working in units where energy and temperature having the same dimensions, so it's fine to express an energy

740
01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:10.870
David Schaich (he): in terms of Kelvin. You can also plug in with the conversion factors to

741
01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:23.490
David Schaich (he): we that to a single electron volt for a relatively small number of joules. 10 to the minus 19 joules, where tools per kelvin

742
01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.439
David Schaich (he): is

743
01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:29.029
David Schaich (he): that conversion factors called the Boltzmann Constant, which is.

744
01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:33.050
David Schaich (he): relates these different choices of units over the energy.

745
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:44.710
David Schaich (he): and since we mostly work with everyday temperatures less than 10,000 kelvin. So right now we're about all right.

746
01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.859
David Schaich (he): 200 by the

747
01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:51.520
David Schaich (he): Helen 20 degrees centigrade.

748
01:08:52.540 --> 01:09:00.050
David Schaich (he): That is much less than 10 to 4. So in everyday metals

749
01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:05.920
David Schaich (he): we can

750
01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:13.490
David Schaich (he): have easily temperatures that are low.

751
01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:15.340
David Schaich (he): With respect to

752
01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:18.229
David Schaich (he): yeah fairly energy well described by

753
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.470
David Schaich (he): it's so cold. He generates

754
01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:25.130
David Schaich (he): electron gas

755
01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:30.430
David Schaich (he): again in the sense of having a single micro stage approximately

756
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:33.080
David Schaich (he): rather than all energy levels being equal.

757
01:09:34.819 --> 01:09:39.490
David Schaich (he): And this connects to some of the huge capacities that

758
01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:50.979
David Schaich (he): we're looking at the tutorials for sounds like. or a computation or an analysis of those heat capacities as coming from

759
01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:58.440
David Schaich (he): that degenerate electron. Yes, and the low temperature limit actually gives us some information that turns out to be

760
01:09:58.490 --> 01:10:00.710
David Schaich (he): a good description of how

761
01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:02.400
David Schaich (he): those metals actually.

762
01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:03.070
it is

763
01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:09.990
David Schaich (he): coming up on this Thursday. We didn't get to it last week, focusing on the

764
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:15.560
David Schaich (he): higher temperature dynamics of the atoms in addition to the electrons in those solids.

765
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:19.320
David Schaich (he): So that's

766
01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:31.010
David Schaich (he): initial orientation for the connection between density and F me, energy for everyday materials. a little iron.

767
01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:35.970
David Schaich (he): If we start thinking about

768
01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:39.740
David Schaich (he): scholars and supernovas, and, for example.

769
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:43.910
David Schaich (he): Star, you know best. is our son.

770
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:48.930
David Schaich (he): What surprised me to point out

771
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:53.630
David Schaich (he): first check this might be counterintuitive. Is that the

772
01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:58.560
David Schaich (he): so actually has? It's similar

773
01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:04.430
David Schaich (he): density to everyday metals sitting around

774
01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:06.280
David Schaich (he): up here

775
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:10.220
David Schaich (he): all the desks and the

776
01:11:11.610 --> 01:11:19.400
David Schaich (he): what comes through cubic meter rather than 10 to 29. I should say that is.

777
01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:25.750
David Schaich (he): on average, Throughout the song there are some variations like orders that we go from

778
01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:29.100
David Schaich (he): the core to the

779
01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:43.740
David Schaich (he): but people responding. I mean energy, for the selling is also similar to that for electrons we work with on a daily basis. So.

780
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:49.460
David Schaich (he): in order of magnitude to the two-thirds powers, about a factor of 5, which gets us up from

781
01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:52.810
David Schaich (he): 10,000 Kelvin to about 100,000 Kelvin.

782
01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:58.350
David Schaich (he): The big difference in the sum compared to

783
01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:02.420
David Schaich (he): what we experience here on Earth

784
01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.270
David Schaich (he): is the higher temperature.

785
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:07.650
exactly

786
01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:10.680
David Schaich (he): much higher temperature, especially in

787
01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:16.650
David Schaich (he): that core region that is getting up to

788
01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:22.300
David Schaich (he): of order of 10 million kelvin, which now.

789
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:25.860
David Schaich (he): rather than being much smaller than that, for the energy

790
01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:29.350
David Schaich (he): is at least a couple of

791
01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:35.240
David Schaich (he): You're at least in the

792
01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.520
David Schaich (he): density is maximized.

793
01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:39.760
David Schaich (he): The

794
01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:43.310
David Schaich (he): reason for this is

795
01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.840
David Schaich (he): both of these acts, the

796
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:48.680
David Schaich (he): relatively low density

797
01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:58.350
David Schaich (he): that's not too different from the and the much higher temperature. I do, too. all the nuclear fusion

798
01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:05.790
David Schaich (he): that is occurring in the core of the sun. that nuclear fusion is

799
01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:11.370
David Schaich (he): releasing vast amounts of heat and light which we are grateful for.

800
01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:18.560
David Schaich (he): as it is the ultimate source of essentially all of the energy that we have access to all her.

801
01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:25.000
David Schaich (he): Yeah. it's coming from

802
01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.320
David Schaich (he): nuclear fusion.

803
01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:40.130
David Schaich (he): A single proton can be a nucleus being 2 protons, one or 2 neutrons.

804
01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:42.090
David Schaich (he): and this

805
01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:45.120
David Schaich (he): fusion has both of these effects.

806
01:13:45.210 --> 01:13:47.220
David Schaich (he): It's a huge amount of heat

807
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:51.770
David Schaich (he): into the that he itself is a

808
01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:54.090
David Schaich (he): form of

809
01:13:56.530 --> 01:14:09.570
David Schaich (he): Yes, this electronic radiation predominantly. So both the heat and the white are. and that huge radiation pressure is.

810
01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:12.270
David Schaich (he): after balancing to

811
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:16.580
David Schaich (he): a large extent to the

812
01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:20.200
David Schaich (he): large gravitational forces

813
01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:22.450
David Schaich (he): that are generated by it.

814
01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:26.710
David Schaich (he): Enormous amount to it. Matter that is, in this.

815
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:31.310
David Schaich (he): This is a precise balance. The sun is in equilibrium with

816
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:40.790
David Schaich (he): balanced precisely by this out of the face we're pushing radiation pressure.

817
01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:45.390
David Schaich (he): and that pressure is pushing out

818
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:50.730
David Schaich (he): all of the material in the sun. spreading it out over here

819
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:53.450
David Schaich (he): larger volume and

820
01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.180
David Schaich (he): and reducing it.

821
01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:00.550
David Schaich (he): It's to be my. It's down to

822
01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:05.110
David Schaich (he): an average just the not much more than we have

823
01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:08.910
David Schaich (he): here on Earth our everyday materials.

824
01:15:12.230 --> 01:15:18.320
David Schaich (he): something interesting happens in the course of stellar evolution for sons that

825
01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:23.600
David Schaich (he): burn all of the hydrogen and the nuclei that they have available.

826
01:15:23.610 --> 01:15:27.930
David Schaich (he): fusing them into a larger. You the I like

827
01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:29.300
of oxygen.

828
01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.770
David Schaich (he): So after

829
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:35.120
David Schaich (he): yeah, basic

830
01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:37.150
David Schaich (he): fuel for

831
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:38.960
David Schaich (he): silver fusion.

832
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:42.430
David Schaich (he): it's exhausted.

833
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:52.990
David Schaich (he): It will be a steep drop in the radiation pressure. No more fusion to.

834
01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:57.860
David Schaich (he): and you can expect

835
01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:04.570
David Schaich (he): in this case finish burning a hydrogen helium that they have available.

836
01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:05.820
David Schaich (he): We'll exhibit it

837
01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:11.260
David Schaich (he): significantly higher density from the gravitational traction

838
01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.790
David Schaich (he): of their maps.

839
01:16:15.150 --> 01:16:18.470
David Schaich (he): The details of how that higher density

840
01:16:18.850 --> 01:16:23.310
David Schaich (he): develops, and it's. In the course of the source. Lifetime depends.

841
01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:33.490
David Schaich (he): The mass of the star starts off with. and if we consider stars that have roughly the mass of our son.

842
01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.590
David Schaich (he): they will generally turn into what it calls

843
01:16:38.210 --> 01:16:40.280
David Schaich (he): white dwarf stars.

844
01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.220
David Schaich (he): which pack

845
01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:51.530
David Schaich (he): some overall mass into a volume

846
01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.760
David Schaich (he): with the radius roughly

847
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:59.690
David Schaich (he): of the earth. so still fairly large, fine

848
01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:07.010
David Schaich (he): our standards with that the earth's a 100 times

849
01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:10.380
David Schaich (he): smaller than that of the sun.

850
01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:21.040
David Schaich (he): which means that the density of the way toward is a 100 times cube. So after 10 to the 6

851
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:30.370
David Schaich (he): you're talking something like tend to be 36

852
01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:36.700
David Schaich (he): electrons. They're focusing on the electrons, because those are

853
01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:39.150
David Schaich (he): for me. On some like certainly

854
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:54.390
David Schaich (he): to put 10 to the 36 electrons for cubic meter in Hey, you different set of units. That's maybe more suggestive of just how.

855
01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:58.440
David Schaich (he): in terms of the mass density of this material

856
01:17:59.010 --> 01:18:07.000
David Schaich (he): that is about a telling. So a 1,000 kg per cubic centimeter of white torque material. So

857
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:09.600
David Schaich (he): indeed.

858
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:12.160
David Schaich (he): and they could do

859
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:15.470
David Schaich (he): the same calculation for the ferry energy.

860
01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:21.330
David Schaich (he): 10 to the sixth increase in you can see this raised to the two-thirds power.

861
01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:34.390
David Schaich (he): So the and the the 5 Kelvin, very energy of the it's raised to an orders of magnitude a building

862
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:38.830
David Schaich (he): which is much larger even than

863
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:42.290
David Schaich (he): the high temperatures of 10 million kelvin.

864
01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:46.310
David Schaich (he): In the course of stars like our son, as they

865
01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:52.990
David Schaich (he): exhaust the last few of them immediately after those nuclear fusion processes seeks.

866
01:18:58.150 --> 01:18:58.720
David Schaich (he): And

867
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:08.380
David Schaich (he): this 10 million Kelvin temperature is actually the worst case for your white dwarf. As time goes on

868
01:19:12.250 --> 01:19:14.360
David Schaich (he): slowly, continue emitting

869
01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:17.880
David Schaich (he): radiation and using that heat so cooling down.

870
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:24.970
David Schaich (he): Ultimately, after several trillion years, it will reach the

871
01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:32.100
David Schaich (he): temperature of the cosmic microwave background, probably 2.7 kelvin. So second orders of magnitude smaller

872
01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:39.260
David Schaich (he): after the 14 million years that the universe has been around. and

873
01:19:39.330 --> 01:19:46.720
David Schaich (he): a similar amount of time. The oldest white force has been sitting out there slowly cooling.

874
01:19:46.770 --> 01:19:50.420
David Schaich (he): It's gotten down to a few 1,000 kelvin.

875
01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.080
David Schaich (he): and that

876
01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:58.150
David Schaich (he): it's what team

877
01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:02.690
David Schaich (he): and well.

878
01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:09.640
David Schaich (he): it's actually the reason that white dwarfs are able to exist survive and hang around to

879
01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.910
David Schaich (he): cool over such long amounts of time

880
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:25.350
David Schaich (he): is. thanks to the degeneracy pressure of the low temperature electron gas. Yeah. they have. thanks to their low temperature relative to

881
01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:29.090
David Schaich (he): you for me. And

882
01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:37.260
David Schaich (he): so remember that without the radiation pressure will be in

883
01:20:37.570 --> 01:20:42.020
David Schaich (he): renewed nuclear fusion of hydro and helium

884
01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.780
David Schaich (he): that is no longer available to counteract

885
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:48.280
David Schaich (he): gravitational collapse.

886
01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:51.560
David Schaich (he): But that gravitational collapse does. and

887
01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:54.640
David Schaich (he): precisely thanks to

888
01:20:56.510 --> 01:21:01.160
David Schaich (he): the degeneracy pressure that we computed just after the great today.

889
01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:07.880
David Schaich (he): At these high densities the the degeneracy pressure of fixing

890
01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:10.820
David Schaich (he): it matters. If it comes not right, you will.

891
01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.120
David Schaich (he): It prevents

892
01:21:13.330 --> 01:21:20.100
David Schaich (he): further gravitational collapse to even denser objects like neutral stars.

893
01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:21.330
particular

894
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:23.240
cool.

895
01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:27.210
David Schaich (he): which

896
01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:31.180
David Schaich (he): is yeah.

897
01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:34.120
David Schaich (he): fascinating

898
01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:38.250
David Schaich (he): manifestation of the

899
01:21:38.850 --> 01:21:40.600
David Schaich (he): the pressure of you know.

900
01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:47.300
David Schaich (he): temperature fermi on gases, their thermodynamics in general rising from the quantum statistics in

901
01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:57.440
David Schaich (he): part of these massive natural physical objects. Something even more interesting can happen, thanks to that degeneracy pressure. If this went to what

902
01:21:57.810 --> 01:22:04.810
David Schaich (he): has a companion star, it exists in what's called yeah binary star system.

903
01:22:06.090 --> 01:22:09.930
David Schaich (he): So this is 2 solid sets. We'll be around each other

904
01:22:11.190 --> 01:22:19.160
David Schaich (he): if one of them becomes a white dwarf. After exhausting it's hydrogen and healing supply

905
01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:31.870
David Schaich (he): it's high. Density. It leads to very strong gravitational fields. That's that. With 2 actually captioning matter from his companion.

906
01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:38.490
David Schaich (he): another star.

907
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:43.130
David Schaich (he): typically a star that is still burning.

908
01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.940
David Schaich (he): And as the light to worth.

909
01:22:47.470 --> 01:23:01.090
David Schaich (he): Slowly, with Sally these pieces of its neighboring star. Over hundreds or thousands or millions of years. it's mass increases. and it's larger density

910
01:23:05.610 --> 01:23:08.050
David Schaich (he): will eventually reach a

911
01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:14.340
David Schaich (he): very special

912
01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:27.540
David Schaich (he): mass. So it's the overall mass that matters which can be converted to a density of the usual way of printing. This is about 40% larger

913
01:23:41.050 --> 01:23:42.510
David Schaich (he): at that point.

914
01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:47.790
David Schaich (he): The density is large enough for

915
01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:52.760
David Schaich (he): different fusion processes to occurred

916
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:58.380
David Schaich (he): in particular, carbon and oxygen, which

917
01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:07.870
David Schaich (he): left over after the hydrogen and helium. all fuse together

918
01:24:10.190 --> 01:24:15.600
David Schaich (he): are able to fuse at those high densities. So this is

919
01:24:18.610 --> 01:24:23.600
David Schaich (he): an artist's illustration of this sort of binary system. and the

920
01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:26.870
David Schaich (he): process of

921
01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:28.700
like to work

922
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:30.280
David Schaich (he): what we have there

923
01:24:31.290 --> 01:24:45.880
David Schaich (he): sucking in matter. and from this larger higher. what? Your companion that has a larger radiation pressure pushing one of its cash to order distances with less gravitational binding.

924
01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:49.070
David Schaich (he): There's this steady accretion

925
01:24:50.550 --> 01:25:01.470
David Schaich (he): matter into the wet dwarf, which we can observe next to the characteristic behavior of what's called the secretion disk is the comes in that's gravitational

926
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:08.240
David Schaich (he): sucked into the white from itself, increasing its energy. I'm sorry, increasing this mass.

927
01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:09.940
David Schaich (he): increasing its density.

928
01:25:11.010 --> 01:25:13.880
David Schaich (he): and at this Chandra seek our limit.

929
01:25:13.950 --> 01:25:18.780
David Schaich (he): enabling carbon and oxygen fusion

930
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:20.530
David Schaich (he): To begin

931
01:25:20.970 --> 01:25:22.360
David Schaich (he): at that point.

932
01:25:23.610 --> 01:25:27.180
David Schaich (he): that first bit of cognitive oxygen fusion helps a bit of

933
01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:32.370
David Schaich (he): energy into

934
01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:37.000
David Schaich (he): the star before that can have an effect in the form of

935
01:25:37.150 --> 01:25:40.660
David Schaich (he): radiation pressure. Expanding the size of the star.

936
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:45.780
David Schaich (he): it actually well heats up the particles right around it.

937
01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:49.310
David Schaich (he): needing to. You see reaction

938
01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:53.060
David Schaich (he): doing more carbon and oxygen fusion.

939
01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:54.880
David Schaich (he): So

940
01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:00.820
David Schaich (he): it's called a thermal nuclear explosion. From that chain reaction.

941
01:26:01.170 --> 01:26:03.620
David Schaich (he): the have the true of the star

942
01:26:04.650 --> 01:26:17.890
David Schaich (he): increase this problem. What might have going down the tens of thousands of Calvin over millions or billions of years within the space of a few seconds. It's explodes up to

943
01:26:18.010 --> 01:26:19.380
David Schaich (he): a 1 billionin California.

944
01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.140
David Schaich (he): I use the

945
01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:32.120
David Schaich (he): term, explodes deliberately. So back in there.

946
01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:36.700
David Schaich (he): This is precisely what you

947
01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:41.340
David Schaich (he): supernova explosion particular what's called

948
01:26:42.450 --> 01:26:45.850
David Schaich (he): a supernova of type. one a

949
01:26:45.870 --> 01:26:47.420
historical reasons.

950
01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:58.650
David Schaich (he): and within those few seconds this wait to more of passing the Sh under sick. Our limits emits amount of energy. That's

951
01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:03.540
David Schaich (he): something like 5 billiontimes right.

952
01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:10.320
David Schaich (he): The energy released by our some in that same time scale.

953
01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:16.750
David Schaich (he): So this particular type of a supernova is not the only one.

954
01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:23.040
David Schaich (he): Why is on the degeneracy pressure? I'll be low temperature.

955
01:27:23.250 --> 01:27:26.770
David Schaich (he): You have some fermionic electrons to occur.

956
01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:28.600
David Schaich (he): and

957
01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:34.570
David Schaich (he): it has to you

958
01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:44.040
David Schaich (he): well. in fact, that it's based on state accretion of mass

959
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:49.580
David Schaich (he): counteracting balanced volume that degeneracy pressure

960
01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:53.920
David Schaich (he): leads to

961
01:27:57.170 --> 01:27:59.360
David Schaich (he): a very large amount of

962
01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:02.800
David Schaich (he): regularity among all of these

963
01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:09.640
David Schaich (he): type one a supernovae, all these binary systems that is very useful for

964
01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:20.300
David Schaich (he): astrophysical and cosmological analysis. It provides something that's called stand your candle

965
01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:23.980
David Schaich (he): Supernova proceeds in roughly the same way

966
01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:31.440
David Schaich (he): in all these different cases. even for stars that are

967
01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:34.740
David Schaich (he): many times older than others.

968
01:28:35.190 --> 01:28:41.360
David Schaich (he): So if we look out at these type one a supernovas and

969
01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:45.400
David Schaich (he): measure their brightness.

970
01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:52.300
David Schaich (he): We can know that they all started roughly with the same like this when they went off, and what we see

971
01:28:53.030 --> 01:29:04.410
David Schaich (he): the modern age is you signed in on it. How far away they are for that brightness you have reduced to the amount that reaches the earth. how far away they are

972
01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:08.230
David Schaich (he): after the light from

973
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:13.370
David Schaich (he): their supernova explosion reaches us. If we feed that into the

974
01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:17.190
David Schaich (he): speed of light, we can tell how long ago they exploded.

975
01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:28.350
David Schaich (he): So what these standard candles Hello! Able to

976
01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:34.740
David Schaich (he): provide cosmologists? Once a map of

977
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:44.250
David Schaich (he): how far away these stars were at various points in time, going back

978
01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:46.390
David Schaich (he): billions of years.

979
01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:57.810
David Schaich (he): some measures of distance as a function of time

980
01:29:57.910 --> 01:30:00.000
David Schaich (he): which actually much to

981
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:03.430
David Schaich (he): most businesses, surprise. sure that

982
01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:06.080
David Schaich (he): the expansion

983
01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:12.980
David Schaich (he): of the universe is actually getting faster.

984
01:30:16.190 --> 01:30:28.690
David Schaich (he): Universes expansion is accelerating. probably over the past hundreds of millions or millions of years. This was discovered by looking at these type one a super node in

985
01:30:31.650 --> 01:30:45.240
David Schaich (he): Cv. No, no prize in physics little over a decade ago. but it was very much contrary to what most scientists were expecting

986
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:51.330
David Schaich (he): at the time the observations were carried out, they assume that the universe was expanding, either with the

987
01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:56.990
David Schaich (he): a constant speed, and for more likely they thought it was being pulled

988
01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:58.970
David Schaich (he): back together to

989
01:30:59.050 --> 01:31:03.270
David Schaich (he): smaller sizes, thanks to the amount of mass that it contains

990
01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:05.580
David Schaich (he): which produces gravitation traction.

991
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.160
David Schaich (he): this result from type, one a supernova.

992
01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:16.290
David Schaich (he): The degeneracy pressure we've computed actually showed that there is

993
01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.940
David Schaich (he): some phenomenon that is

994
01:31:21.230 --> 01:31:24.120
David Schaich (he): using the gravitational repulsion.

995
01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:27.610
David Schaich (he): This is commonly called dark energy, though

996
01:31:28.090 --> 01:31:33.180
David Schaich (he): that is a term for it, because energy actually causes gravitational fraction

997
01:31:33.310 --> 01:31:46.790
David Schaich (he): rather than repulsion. The ultimate cause of this one of the chief mystery is that several folks here in theoretical physics department are

998
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:48.050
David Schaich (he): researching.

999
01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:50.300
David Schaich (he): but that is.

1000
01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:52.100
you know.

1001
01:31:52.130 --> 01:31:59.190
David Schaich (he): to you set about fight for supernovas and dark energy. Are there any questions about

1002
01:31:59.490 --> 01:32:02.600
David Schaich (he): that or any other aspects of

1003
01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:12.180
David Schaich (he): you low temperature for me on gas before you turn to something completely different.

1004
01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:27.790
David Schaich (he): Yes. so at this point there is a

1005
01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:34.800
David Schaich (he): some value in an exercise that rings together the to

1006
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:40.040
David Schaich (he): autumn gaps as we've looked at so far all through relativistic photons and

1007
01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:41.930
David Schaich (he): download this stick.

1008
01:32:42.150 --> 01:32:45.590
David Schaich (he): Those

1009
01:32:46.690 --> 01:32:50.040
David Schaich (he): consider the case of it.

1010
01:32:52.050 --> 01:32:53.940
David Schaich (he): optimistic for me on this

1011
01:32:57.650 --> 01:33:11.940
David Schaich (he): particular ideal gas. Of those. an example of all the basic fermions are particles known as neutrinos. This will exhibit some features of the normalistic premium gas

1012
01:33:12.370 --> 01:33:16.340
David Schaich (he): on in particular, with the occupation numbers of these

1013
01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:20.900
David Schaich (he): ultimately for the ons, as well as some features of

1014
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:25.730
David Schaich (he): realistic pose up gas and photons.

1015
01:33:30.330 --> 01:33:36.690
David Schaich (he): That is any natural next topic to consider it

1016
01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:40.340
David Schaich (he): as is

1017
01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:47.540
David Schaich (he): something that has been sort of advertised several times throughout the day. I'm sure

1018
01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:57.370
David Schaich (he): corrections to that low temperature limits some more systematic expansions and powers

1019
01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:11.710
David Schaich (he): of the low temperature compared to the fermi energy or chemical potential. both of those not going to go through live.

1020
01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:15.930
David Schaich (he): That will be the

1021
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:20.020
David Schaich (he): I, because the Pencasts I have planned.

1022
01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.170
David Schaich (he): and instead.

1023
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:36.660
David Schaich (he): I want to make sure that the lectures themselves give you wonderful opportunity to. I consider, ask questions about.

1024
01:34:38.730 --> 01:34:40.230
David Schaich (he): not ideal.

1025
01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:47.130
David Schaich (he): some of the dynamic systems that involved direct interactions

1026
01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:51.970
David Schaich (he): between the degrees of freedom.

1027
01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:56.010
David Schaich (he): So we only have time today to

1028
01:34:57.410 --> 01:35:00.540
David Schaich (he): motivate this. and

1029
01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:07.090
David Schaich (he): there are a few parts to that motivation. First, the question of why

1030
01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:13.110
David Schaich (he): we have not talked about this up until now. with the end of the term.

1031
01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:17.670
David Schaich (he): and also the question of why we are talking about it now. So we

1032
01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:19.640
David Schaich (he): so far

1033
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:26.620
David Schaich (he): very good physical predictions.

1034
01:35:29.850 --> 01:35:31.120
David Schaich (he): How many do you know?

1035
01:35:32.130 --> 01:35:35.110
David Schaich (he): Not interacting ideal systems?

1036
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:42.170
David Schaich (he): So that was I just like to like spectrum the

1037
01:35:43.890 --> 01:35:47.130
David Schaich (he): what we'll look at on this tutorial on Thursday?

1038
01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:50.270
David Schaich (he): It's the heat capacity, for

1039
01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:54.230
David Schaich (he): it was everyday medals that just came up.

1040
01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:57.410
David Schaich (he): But

1041
01:35:59.870 --> 01:36:06.220
David Schaich (he): it's not the tracking systems. All are insufficient to describe everything

1042
01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:13.310
David Schaich (he): of interest in one particular set of No, no.

1043
01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:23.390
David Schaich (he): that they generally fail to describe very well or at all. I know it has

1044
01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:27.030
David Schaich (he): these transitions.

1045
01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:31.290
David Schaich (he): which are. it's familiar from

1046
01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:41.490
David Schaich (he): every day experience things like the liquid gas phase transition that we can induce by more than you can with water. The point that

1047
01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:44.110
David Schaich (he): I never go to a

1048
01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:47.410
David Schaich (he): transition co existence of liquid gas.

1049
01:36:47.690 --> 01:36:49.090
David Schaich (he): wireless team

1050
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:52.650
David Schaich (he): and many other examples of this that

1051
01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:55.800
David Schaich (he): well begin to get into tomorrow.

1052
01:36:57.220 --> 01:37:09.500
David Schaich (he): And the reason we yeah. not going into these interacting systems so far I talked about uses and these transitions. It's just that.

1053
01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:16.490
David Schaich (he): Once we introduce interactions you will see that

1054
01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:25.200
David Schaich (he): the systems become very quickly, very much harder. Analyze mathematically.

1055
01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:30.900
David Schaich (he): In general

1056
01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:46.730
David Schaich (he): there will not be any close form solution of this with that we central module Oops bye. just for me.

1057
01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:51.750
David Schaich (he): You spend their module arriving things like the I

1058
01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:52.900
small

1059
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:58.250
David Schaich (he): the heat capacity for curious

1060
01:37:58.790 --> 01:38:01.170
David Schaich (he): dynamic systems.

1061
01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:12.700
David Schaich (he): Once the interactions are turned on. we won't be able to get. but it's sort of the close for predictions, or even

1062
01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:16.200
David Schaich (he): very good approximations

1063
01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:20.190
David Schaich (he): based on

1064
01:38:22.290 --> 01:38:26.390
David Schaich (he): You know the computations by hand. much

1065
01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:31.230
David Schaich (he): ongoing research, and all these statistical physics. For this reason why

1066
01:38:31.390 --> 01:38:39.160
David Schaich (he): numerical computer calculations. in order to analyze these sorts of interacting systems

1067
01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:42.620
David Schaich (he): have a bit of a taste of that from looking at

1068
01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:45.360
David Schaich (he): the random walks that come from

1069
01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:54.350
David Schaich (he): the country. Lorentz distribution, for which the me and the standard deviation are not defined. Interactions take us into a

1070
01:38:54.430 --> 01:38:56.650
David Schaich (he): similar situation.

1071
01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:57.340
Okay.

1072
01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:01.470
David Schaich (he): no. actually broader landscape, all of the possible phenomena

1073
01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:03.960
David Schaich (he): and possible systems to consider.

1074
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:14.040
David Schaich (he): We are out of time to again those considerations today. Motivation looking forward. Oh. wrap it up there.

1075
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:16.990
David Schaich (he): Let you go off to the rest of your day.

1076
01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:25.290
