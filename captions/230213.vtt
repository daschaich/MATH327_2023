1
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:13.990
David Schaich (he): All right. I think even the clock on the wall is saying it's 9. So welcome back to Monday morning. I hope your weekend was more fun than mine.  Are there

2
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.770
David Schaich (he): any immediate questions before we get back into statistical physics?

3
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.810
David Schaich (he): I can, while you consider that, put up the six-digit code for today: 3 3 3

4
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.810
David Schaich (he): 7 8 7.

5
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.770
David Schaich (he): And, well,

6
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.000
David Schaich (he): it's been a while --- a full week --- since our last

7
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.140
David Schaich (he): lecture together. So it's worth

8
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:48.360
David Schaich (he): doing a somewhat detailed recap of what we went through last time, which focused on

9
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.400
David Schaich (he): random walks

10
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.220
David Schaich (he): as a

11
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.910
David Schaich (he): surprisingly generic and useful tool for modeling stochastic processes.

12
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.080
David Schaich (he): So, in addition to the simple example of a random walk

13
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.560
David Schaich (he): that we went through in the lecture, just

14
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:33.980
David Schaich (he): stepping left to right on the line with the pick step length. You've seen that the computer project involves more interesting random walk still in one dimension on the line, but with varying set lengths drawn from some distribution.

15
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.320
David Schaich (he): Either

16
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.660
you will behave distribution with a

17
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.620
David Schaich (he): finite, mean, and standard deviation.

18
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.640
David Schaich (he): or, as we will look at a bit more tomorrow. A

19
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.580
David Schaich (he): so, a pathological distribution of the

20
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.510
David Schaich (he): I mean the standard deviation not so well behaved.

21
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.680
David Schaich (he): and the resulting behavior of the random walk is

22
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.620
David Schaich (he): a bit more unusual

23
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.080
David Schaich (he): in the sense that we

24
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:11.580
David Schaich (he): one thing we did was recast. The random walks in terms of a drift, velocity and diffusion coefficients.

25
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.220
David Schaich (he): one of which

26
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:31.240
David Schaich (he): which is describing how the expected or expectation value. The final length of the walk is gradually drifting, as more and more steps are taken over

27
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.140
David Schaich (he): a longer period of time. T.

28
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.880
David Schaich (he): With the fixed step length. where this

29
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.600
time of the life T, divided by the number of steps, is

30
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:54.180
David Schaich (he): some. and the drip velocity is just related to the mean of the single step process. So we get behavior of the overall walk.

31
00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:06.420
David Schaich (he): Probably the characteristics of a single step. And similarly. that diffusion constant is totally into the standard deviation on the single step

32
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.300
David Schaich (he): Sigma squared.

33
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.330
David Schaich (he): Okay, the interval of the section being taken which is.

34
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.300
David Schaich (he): and

35
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:31.030
David Schaich (he): appears in the very generic law of diffusion. setting that the uncertainty of the scale of fluctuations in an overall

36
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.530
David Schaich (he): property of the walk to the uncertainties

37
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.210
David Schaich (he): in this final position

38
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:45.750
David Schaich (he): are proportional to the square root of the amount of time that the walk lasts, that that comes into proportionality just being given by this diffusion, coefficient

39
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.700
David Schaich (he): related to the standard deviation of the single step process.

40
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.360
David Schaich (he): And this is

41
00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:02.010
David Schaich (he): a very generic relation, in part because it is related to the central.

42
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.820
David Schaich (he): so this more diffusion will hold in any situation where the central theater of itself holds

43
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:20.760
David Schaich (he): it's just. We saw just re what we' on the assumption of the finite mean and the standard deviation for the single step process.

44
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.910
David Schaich (he): and we can recast the probability, distribution

45
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.380
David Schaich (he): from the central limit, theorem in terms of the diffusion, constant

46
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.570
David Schaich (he): Andrew philosophy that were introduced in the context of

47
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.830
David Schaich (he): some walker moving left to right on the line.

48
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.190
David Schaich (he): generalize to higher dimensions and abstract spaces.

49
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.800
David Schaich (he): So that is

50
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.160
David Schaich (he): something. Again, we're seeing in the computer project, and we will see again either today or next week. And the lecture is a

51
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.780
David Schaich (he): cool to model the stochastic process.

52
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:06.360
David Schaich (he): and we wrapped up last week just by introducing spin systems so another

53
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.360
useful

54
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.630
David Schaich (he): framework to model a wide variety of stochastic systems.

55
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.550
David Schaich (he): and this was our gateway to

56
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.530
David Schaich (he): introducing the concept of

57
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.700
David Schaich (he): statistical ensembles which we will wrap up today

58
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.390
David Schaich (he): as a preliminary first step last week

59
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:38.690
David Schaich (he): began considering conserved quantities. and in particular this so called for a small of thermodynamics

60
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.390
David Schaich (he): which is now into his friends.

61
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.470
David Schaich (he): Yes, conservation of energy.

62
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.290
David Schaich (he): a familiar concept that

63
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.860
David Schaich (he): for Scott some

64
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.700
David Schaich (he): formulation back in the days before. Here is 0

65
00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:02.920
David Schaich (he): as the empirical observation about the behavior of large scale stochastic systems. Are there any

66
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.070
David Schaich (he): questions about any of these topics before we

67
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.430
David Schaich (he): move on to on that for today.

68
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.440
David Schaich (he): Hope you, too.

69
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.270
David Schaich (he): First

70
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.240
David Schaich (he): realization. You know it's the micro canonical ensemble.

71
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.160
David Schaich (he): You will find that and start looking at properties of it, including Oops

72
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.790
David Schaich (he): equilibrium.

73
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:50.840
David Schaich (he): You can repeat it. and related to the entropy what it's called the second law

74
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.500
David Schaich (he): of thermodynamics. It's called beyond

75
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.500
David Schaich (he): at the bottom of the screen there.

76
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.220
David Schaich (he): and not seeing that maybe the questions

77
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.100
David Schaich (he): i'll pick up essentially where you left off.

78
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.880
David Schaich (he): We have.

79
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.190
You spin systems to consider.

80
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:24.700
David Schaich (he): We want to combine this with the the first law and conservation of energy.

81
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:26.680
David Schaich (he): So.

82
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:35.380
David Schaich (he): looking at the spin system, we can introduce energy as

83
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.550
David Schaich (he): the interaction between the spin

84
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:50.880
David Schaich (he): and some external field. I'm. Trying to work all in magnetic field.

85
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.170
David Schaich (he): just based on some of the historical

86
00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:01.810
David Schaich (he): context in which these spins were initially modeled as magnetic dipole in external fields. To

87
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.110
David Schaich (he): I'll provide a mathematical description of things like

88
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.460
molecular materials

89
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.750
David Schaich (he): and spontaneous for a magnificent. So

90
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.250
we can recall that

91
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:24.110
David Schaich (he): in spin degrees of freedom take only 2 values. They can. My up will point down. and i'll use it

92
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.240
color for just the constant external magnetic field.

93
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.660
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

94
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.360
David Schaich (he): the strength in and say that

95
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.559
David Schaich (he): in is positive when the

96
00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:47.410
David Schaich (he): up in the same direction as the spin pointing out

97
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.340
David Schaich (he): and the energy. So

98
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:58.230
David Schaich (he): I draw the field off to the side. You can think of it permeating this whole space that these spins are sitting in.

99
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.430
David Schaich (he): and the energy

100
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.560
based in pointing up in the same direction.

101
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.710
David Schaich (he): That's the magnetic field. It's just a

102
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.600
David Schaich (he): factor minus H, which is less than 0,

103
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.100
David Schaich (he): the full page in view.

104
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:26.230
David Schaich (he): So that's a negative energy. If the spin is aligned. it's a field so

105
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:31.700
David Schaich (he): sorry that it's been pointing up has a negative energy where it's been pointing down.

106
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.690
David Schaich (he): has positive energy. H.

107
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.270
David Schaich (he): It's been anti align with the field, have a higher energy, so we can

108
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:53.820
David Schaich (he): think of this as the spin wanted to align with the external field that is in that lowers and center. She makes it happier. and in a generic system, with

109
00:09:54.340 --> 00:10:05.470
David Schaich (he): a total number of end spins. you can say that. and most of those spins are pointing up negative energy. So sorry.

110
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.370
David Schaich (he): Use the subscripts plus for negative energy. This will be useful later on, I promise.

111
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.270
David Schaich (he): and then the remaining spins, that capital and

112
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.080
David Schaich (he): minus n plus

113
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:23.990
David Schaich (he): part of this, pointing down and minus that, each contribute a positive energy.

114
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.250
David Schaich (he): So, putting this together the

115
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.090
David Schaich (he): total energy

116
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.710
David Schaich (he): or and spins.

117
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.010
David Schaich (he): It is going to be a contribution of

118
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.760
David Schaich (he): minus, aged from each of those n plus upward joining spins.

119
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.980
David Schaich (he): and

120
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:50.910
David Schaich (he): to the contribution of plus H from each of the N minus camera pointing spins.

121
00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.910
David Schaich (he): because the end line is is capital and minus n plus. We have

122
00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.550
David Schaich (he): a positive factor of capital n 2 negative factors

123
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:14.650
David Schaich (he): and plus. So we can pull out the overall pack of minus H. And you get a 2 n plus minus N, which is not so different from

124
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.810
David Schaich (he): the probability for a random walk that they fixed length

125
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:27.760
David Schaich (he): with the big step size that we looked at last week, and that is not a coincidence. Actually, the energy can be

126
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:34.950
David Schaich (he): considered. A random walk and spin space where each of the up or down recording spins can be interpreted as a step

127
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.070
David Schaich (he): of a fixed length, and the energy will come back to that.

128
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.920
David Schaich (he): So, just to make sure this is all clear, I

129
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.760
David Schaich (he): can ask you what is the energy of

130
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.360
David Schaich (he): a given configuration with, say.

131
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.620
David Schaich (he): 8 spins.

132
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.950
David Schaich (he): I think so.

133
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.400
David Schaich (he): Hmm.

134
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.980
David Schaich (he): Not quite.

135
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:40.010
David Schaich (he): We do have the minus h upfront.

136
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.280
David Schaich (he): and then you want to plug in

137
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:53.350
David Schaich (he): 2 times the number of upper pointing spins. So count 6, pointing out

138
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.610
out of the

139
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.140
David Schaich (he): total.

140
00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:02.530
David Schaich (he): And then what you did was subtract the number of downloading spins. But it's actually the capital in

141
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.480
David Schaich (he): that gets attracted. Some of the

142
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.620
2, minus 6, minus 2. It's 2 minus 6

143
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:20.850
David Schaich (he): find the State the total number of 8 spins. and that is for one states use for left over What's the overall negative value that reflects the fact that most of the spins are pointing.

144
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:30.310
David Schaich (he): and that same direction as the upper pointing magnetic field with the positive h greater than 0.

145
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.510
David Schaich (he): So

146
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:39.340
David Schaich (he): another thing we can check here is. So

147
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.890
David Schaich (he): you've talked about energy conservation.

148
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:56.210
David Schaich (he): If we demand that this energy E to the minus e equals minus 4 H. It's conserved.

149
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.320
David Schaich (he): and an interesting question is.

150
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.810
David Schaich (he): what fraction

151
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.720
David Schaich (he): all of the whole number of states or spin configurations of the system.

152
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.710
David Schaich (he): all right. allowed by energy conservation.

153
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:27.750
David Schaich (he): So we can break this up into 2 steps. You want to

154
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:46.260
David Schaich (he): compute both the number of configurations that are allowed, and divide that by the number of total spin configurations for 8 spins, which we figured out last week

155
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:53.920
David Schaich (he): was 2 to the in here, and is 8 to the ages. 256,

156
00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:06.120
David Schaich (he): and the total number that are allowed is the number of spin configurations with

157
00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:16.930
David Schaich (he): the same energy. E to the minus 4. H. Anyone have the idea as to what that number would be.

158
00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:26.460
David Schaich (he): Yeah. yes. it's up again the same

159
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:32.610
David Schaich (he): mathematics that we did for a random walk where we don't care about what order

160
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:40.490
David Schaich (he): the steps come in, or in this case, what order the upper downward pointing expense come in. We just want all possible ways of having

161
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:48.570
David Schaich (he): 6 0f the spins out of the 8 total the Oh.

162
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.700
David Schaich (he): which is the

163
00:15:51.550 --> 00:16:00.410
David Schaich (he): I know your coefficients 8 t0 6, which you calling it by the co-official is he

164
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.700
David Schaich (he): i'm 7 0ver 2, s0 56 0r

165
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.810
David Schaich (he): cancel out the 2 from the 8 7 times 4 is 28,

166
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:20.560
David Schaich (he): s0 28 0ver 2 56. We can take out another factor of 4 from the 2 56. Get that down to 64, and just back to the 7,

167
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:26.960
David Schaich (he): which is roughly 11% of the total number of spin configurations

168
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:29.730
David Schaich (he): are allowed, given conservation

169
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:30.890
David Schaich (he): of energy.

170
00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:41.890
David Schaich (he): and one other system that I will just mentioned in passing is

171
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:47.910
David Schaich (he): sort of getting back to the initial consideration that was up, that you were coming in today.

172
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.710
David Schaich (he): thinking about the air in this room as

173
00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.900
David Schaich (he): 10 to the power 25 molecules

174
00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:56.710
each of those

175
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.050
David Schaich (he): molecules. If we

176
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.030
David Schaich (he): ignore any of the weak interactions between them

177
00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:13.470
David Schaich (he): and that they are non-relativistic, just classical particles with

178
00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:20.210
David Schaich (he): no internal structure or spin. So various simplifying assumptions.

179
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:28.760
David Schaich (he): What we call point particles. We don't know any information about internal dynamics or orientation.

180
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:34.650
David Schaich (he): The only oops it should be energy. Oh.

181
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:41.900
David Schaich (he): only contribution. The energy comes from the classical kinetic energy one half.

182
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.290
David Schaich (he): you know, again assume that all these molecules have

183
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:53.310
David Schaich (he): the same mass, which is not quite true of the air in the room, but good enough for a first approximation.

184
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:54.690
David Schaich (he): We have

185
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.390
David Schaich (he): some over all 10 to the 25 0f those particles.

186
00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:00.560
David Schaich (he): 50

187
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.320
David Schaich (he): free velocity squared for

188
00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:09.330
David Schaich (he): each of them, which we can also we cast in terms of their momentum.

189
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.700
David Schaich (he): also a free, vector

190
00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.030
David Schaich (he): the momentum of each particle

191
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:25.890
David Schaich (he): it's just the mass times this velocity. I'm sure you seen that before, but possibly not for a while.

192
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:40.970
David Schaich (he): And so we're getting back to the big picture of this module that in theory you could just set up all of those 10 t0 25 initial conditions

193
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:54.070
David Schaich (he): solve the differential equations that describe the interplay of position and momentum of all those particles just Hamilton's equations coming from Newton's laws.

194
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.220
David Schaich (he): but in practice it's impossible to.

195
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.780
David Schaich (he): So that Number

196
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.010
David Schaich (he): I evolution

197
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:12.890
David Schaich (he): equations, or even to quick down

198
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:21.810
David Schaich (he): the initial conditions for all of those and 25

199
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.990
David Schaich (he): particles.

200
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:36.460
David Schaich (he): We saw the candy start in the very first lecture that that would require something on the order of

201
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:48.860
David Schaich (he): 10 trillion terabytes of data, just to to be floating point number to each component of velocity or momentum. hey? And

202
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.970
David Schaich (he): the basics of the basis

203
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.140
David Schaich (he): instead

204
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:57.660
David Schaich (he): to treat the time, evolution

205
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:06.400
David Schaich (he): of all of these particles. As you stochastic process.

206
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.900
David Schaich (he): we have our system of a large number of particles

207
00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.640
David Schaich (he): that at

208
00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.330
David Schaich (he): say, time t one

209
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:21.310
David Schaich (he): using some state, i'll make a one the carry out the experiments I'm. Observing.

210
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.550
David Schaich (he): at least as a thought experiment. Do you

211
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:34.440
David Schaich (he): microscopic details and all the particles in the room, all of that state omega One. as time passes to a different time t 2.

212
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:41.300
David Schaich (he): We repeat that experiments get another. a state of all those particles. and s0 0n.

213
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.260
or each step in time

214
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:49.100
David Schaich (he): all right. filling out the

215
00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:57.940
David Schaich (he): whole behavior of the time, evolution of all of these large numbers of degrees of freedom. And because

216
00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:05.840
David Schaich (he): each of these States Omega is describing all of the microscopic details of the microscopic particles

217
00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:09.220
David Schaich (he): in the system. I'm. Going to start referring

218
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.540
David Schaich (he): to these States in particular

219
00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.560
David Schaich (he): as

220
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:27.610
David Schaich (he): micro-states. which will help distinguish them from Macro States or thermodynamic states and in later work. It's just a bit of terminology for now

221
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:33.020
David Schaich (he): it gives us the formal definition of

222
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.960
David Schaich (he): Hey Statistical. on

223
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.400
David Schaich (he): which is the set

224
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.380
David Schaich (he): of all the microstates

225
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:54.430
David Schaich (he): we can call again capital. Omega should see

226
00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.180
David Schaich (he): set out of. So it's overcase on me. Go.

227
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.090
David Schaich (he): They are accessible

228
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.090
David Schaich (he): through time evolution.

229
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:20.460
David Schaich (he): So we are connecting

230
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.270
Yeah, a picture of

231
00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:28.710
David Schaich (he): the error in this room or any other collection of a large number of degrees of freedom

232
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.630
David Schaich (he): as a set of all states, instead of all microstates. and

233
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:40.540
David Schaich (he): also it's part of this definition. I know that each microstate

234
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.760
David Schaich (he): call it or make a I has a corresponding

235
00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.110
David Schaich (he): probability. Oops

236
00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:07.270
David Schaich (he): we can call pi of being adopted by our system. so the probability of being the outcome of our experiments.

237
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:20.890
David Schaich (he): of observing the state of all these degrees of freedom. and we can recognize a set of states which we can extract this set of events. each with a corresponding probability.

238
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:25.150
David Schaich (he): As an example of realization. I'll be here

239
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:28.620
David Schaich (he): outgoing spaces

240
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:35.110
David Schaich (he): that we have defined earlier. So a statistical ensemble is a particular realization

241
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:45.630
David Schaich (he): of the probability space that we get from the experiment of just taking a collection of a large number of particles. letting them move all the time. And the

242
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:58.420
David Schaich (he): we're telling you that we can observe all of the microscopic information about that system. so that is connecting us to the probability foundation and

243
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.910
David Schaich (he): will be the tool that we use

244
00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.130
David Schaich (he): to now begin analyzing it.

245
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.930
David Schaich (he): These systems using stochastic and probabilistic tools.

246
00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:10.900
David Schaich (he): one

247
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.310
David Schaich (he): quick enough, hopefully obvious comments to

248
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.720
the on the way to that

249
00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:21.660
David Schaich (he): is that, as always. if we have a collection of probabilities.

250
00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:23.990
David Schaich (he): they need to

251
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.440
David Schaich (he): add up to a 100%.

252
00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:30.110
David Schaich (he): If we sum over all of the

253
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.200
David Schaich (he): microstates that we have assuming

254
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.270
David Schaich (he): those accountable just for simplicity, so that the sum is what we find

255
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:44.850
David Schaich (he): and what this just means in the context of the statistical ensemble is that our

256
00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.910
David Schaich (he): system of many ways of freedom

257
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.800
David Schaich (he): has to be in some accessible microstates

258
00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.550
David Schaich (he): at any point in time.

259
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:14.770
David Schaich (he): So there's that sure. simple physical interpretation of for basic

260
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:19.860
David Schaich (he): definition, the basic requirement for a well-defined probability.

261
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.960
David Schaich (he): So any questions about that contacts are set up so far

262
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:38.090
David Schaich (he): and not seeing any. The next step is to to come a bit more specific. and actually

263
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:44.240
David Schaich (he): go back to something you might have worried about as I

264
00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.210
David Schaich (he): wrote it down. What does it mean?

265
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.240
David Schaich (he): For

266
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.710
David Schaich (he): in microstate to be accessible or inaccessible?

267
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:59.140
David Schaich (he): And what that means in broad terms is that

268
00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:04.820
David Schaich (he): the microstates that are accessible have to satisfy certain physical conditions

269
00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:09.230
David Schaich (he): which are given by those conserved quantities that

270
00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:13.390
David Schaich (he): we introduced last time. So

271
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:25.630
David Schaich (he): the time of ownership that defines a statistical on software is characterized or constrained by the set of the quantities

272
00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.330
David Schaich (he): that are conserved to say that

273
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:34.530
David Schaich (he): let's see another way. You conserved

274
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:37.780
David Schaich (he): one of these

275
00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.610
David Schaich (he): that are unchanged

276
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.960
David Schaich (he): under time evolution

277
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:59.870
David Schaich (he): because they are unchanged in their time evolution. They are actually characteristics of the statistical ensemble.

278
00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:13.640
David Schaich (he): and taking just the simplest possible set of conservative quantities.

279
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.870
David Schaich (he): You exhaust a particular statistical ensemble.

280
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:25.120
David Schaich (he): which is known as micro canonical ensemble.

281
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:28.320
David Schaich (he): which is.

282
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.300
David Schaich (he): you find that by

283
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.270
David Schaich (he): conservation of energy

284
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.740
David Schaich (he): in line with the first law of thermodynamics.

285
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.900
David Schaich (he): keep repeating: this is the

286
00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:54.770
David Schaich (he): internal energy of that system since we discussed last week, and

287
00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:08.380
David Schaich (he): we also demand that the number of degrees of freedom he is conserved, and to avoid having to right degree of freedom

288
00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:13.520
David Schaich (he): over and over, I will call that particle number, and refer to it by that capital N.

289
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:17.840
David Schaich (he): And the particle here may well be

290
00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:20.650
David Schaich (he): a molecule or an atom bouncing around.

291
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:28.340
David Schaich (he): but it could just as well be a spin in the system, or a more abstract concept, just the number of degrees of freedom.

292
00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:35.400
David Schaich (he): One thing to note about the microcontroller, which we will come back to probably next week

293
00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.550
David Schaich (he): is that

294
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.160
David Schaich (he): conservation of energy which

295
00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:51.780
David Schaich (he): only holds in closed systems implies that any statistical system

296
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:56.640
David Schaich (he): described as a micro canonical ensemble has to be completely isolated

297
00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.360
David Schaich (he): from this environment.

298
00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:10.450
David Schaich (he): unable to exchange any energy or any particles with anything around it, so it's in a sealed off container, floating in the void of space.

299
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:19.010
David Schaich (he): and no energy can be exchange with the outside, which makes it in practice on

300
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:26.130
David Schaich (he): essentially impossible to look inside and and see the behavior of the system.

301
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:35.290
David Schaich (he): but as a rough approximation to the behavior of physical systems, it can be

302
00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:41.060
David Schaich (he): a place to start, and we can use this to think about the behavior of the

303
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:49.990
David Schaich (he): say that the energy that's coming in from the sunlight outside, or just from heat, being able to pass through the windows and the walls

304
00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:52.540
David Schaich (he): and the forest and the ceiling, are

305
00:29:52.580 --> 00:30:01.820
David Schaich (he): small corrections for small violations of the condition of conserved energy and particle number. We can

306
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:08.620
David Schaich (he): hop back to. Yes. those questions that

307
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.910
David Schaich (he): you may have considered just before we got started today.

308
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.200
David Schaich (he): and

309
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.720
David Schaich (he): think about the a physical intuition

310
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.230
David Schaich (he): it's behaving.

311
00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:34.540
David Schaich (he): And hopefully you will agree with me when I say that. based on our everyday experience, we should expect

312
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:41.560
David Schaich (he): things like the air in this room, or a micro canonical on the more generally

313
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:43.840
David Schaich (he): to exhibit

314
00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:51.470
David Schaich (he): study, smooth. stable behavior as time passes.

315
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:56.600
David Schaich (he): So.

316
00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:04.940
David Schaich (he): just to make this more concrete thinking about the air in this room. we expect it to be fairly, uniformly distributed.

317
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.600
David Schaich (he): and not

318
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.560
all clustering together

319
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:14.730
David Schaich (he): in the upper right hand corner. 1 0ne half of the room.

320
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:23.910
David Schaich (he): What we expect of the air to spontaneously shift from one half of the room to the other. It feels like.

321
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.000
David Schaich (he): Hey, Barry. all stable and

322
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:41.030
David Schaich (he): steady state or same system. This sort of behavior is formalized in the concept of equilibrium

323
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.660
David Schaich (he): which for our purposes, we can.

324
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.280
David Schaich (he): we will mathematically the phone in, but should keep in mind this

325
00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.980
David Schaich (he): qualitative, conceptual and physically motivated

326
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:58.070
David Schaich (he): definition that's equilibrium. Behavior is

327
00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:02.960
David Schaich (he): stay and smooth and stable as time passes with no

328
00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:12.110
David Schaich (he): dramatic changes. and also no sort of unusual behavior, even though it's possible for

329
00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:17.100
with the air in this room to have a microstate with all the molecules

330
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.790
David Schaich (he): on the right hand side. that would be

331
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:29.520
David Schaich (he): contrary t0 0ur physical intuition, and not something that we would expect so

332
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:34.890
David Schaich (he): to formalize this

333
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:40.460
David Schaich (he): concept of equilibrium and specifically thermodynamic equilibrium.

334
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:48.630
David Schaich (he): You will specifically consider hey micro canonical system

335
00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:55.510
David Schaich (he): that I will refer to as the capital Omega.

336
00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:59.290
David Schaich (he): It's like the use of notation. This is

337
00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:05.100
David Schaich (he): a set of all accessible states, but it also brings along the corresponding probabilities.

338
00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:18.050
David Schaich (he): So this is the probability space defining our system that obeys energy, conservation and conservation particle number to be a well-defined micro canonical system

339
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:24.040
David Schaich (he): and stay that the system has. and

340
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:28.410
David Schaich (he): microstates.

341
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:31.030
David Schaich (he): then

342
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:36.720
David Schaich (he): thermodynamic equilibrium

343
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:42.180
David Schaich (he): for the micro canonical

344
00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:51.630
David Schaich (he): is defined to be the situation that we have. if and only if

345
00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:01.230
David Schaich (he): all of the probabilities for these end microstates are equal.

346
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:10.820
David Schaich (he): So this is

347
00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:18.350
David Schaich (he): I. It's good to keep in mind the physical picture, because it's not immediately obvious, at least to me, how we get from

348
00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:22.460
David Schaich (he): all probabilities equal to the sort of smooth behavior that

349
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:35.000
David Schaich (he): you would expect. We say that the probability for having all of the air on the right half of the room is equal to the probability for having all the molecules distributed more smoothly at.

350
00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:38.060
David Schaich (he): if we think about it. In that way it seems counterintuitive.

351
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.570
David Schaich (he): and we will see

352
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:42.139
how

353
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:49.310
David Schaich (he): this definition matches on to the physical expectation that

354
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:52.520
David Schaich (he): we can bring in from our experience

355
00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.030
David Schaich (he): in particular.

356
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:58.200
David Schaich (he): Assuming that the number of microstates is finite.

357
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:05.080
David Schaich (he): then we know that each of these probabilities

358
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:12.200
David Schaich (he): is equal to one over the total number of microstates. Just so that

359
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:21.510
David Schaich (he): so over all pis is M. Factors of cost of probability

360
00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:27.210
David Schaich (he): that are all equal t0 0ne over M. And satisfies the condition to be

361
00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.270
David Schaich (he): it well behaved. Probability.

362
00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:36.190
David Schaich (he): And one thing to no before going on is that

363
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:39.170
David Schaich (he): even in equilibrium

364
00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:46.230
David Schaich (he): the system is dynamic and the

365
00:35:46.470 --> 00:36:00.530
David Schaich (he): it is not some static state. it continues. it's time evolution adopting now different microstates. one after the next, as time goes by

366
00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:12.490
David Schaich (he): adopting each given microstate with the same probability. So this is

367
00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:25.030
David Schaich (he): another way of phrasing. It is that the steady system is not a static one.

368
00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:30.130
David Schaich (he): We still have this

369
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.050
David Schaich (he): through microstates, and as time passes

370
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:44.020
David Schaich (he): in the equilibrium that we are talking about is. hey? Dynamic way of being

371
00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:53.820
David Schaich (he): something that we can say interesting things about using probability theory. the emergence.

372
00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:00.630
David Schaich (he): oh. study large scale behavior from this

373
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:03.730
David Schaich (he): equilibrium

374
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:14.460
David Schaich (he): is related to hey? Derive quality? Yes. no, as the entropy which

375
00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.410
I suspect you have heard of it.

376
00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:32.080
David Schaich (he): and we will now we all, in that hey mathematical footing. to be able to bring it to bear in analyses of micro canonical ensemble, and other other statistical ensembles

377
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:34.590
David Schaich (he): more generally

378
00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:41.870
David Schaich (he): so

379
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:48.430
David Schaich (he): sure. If there are any questions about the micro canonical ensemble before we.

380
00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:52.100
David Schaich (he): You want to define that the entropy.

381
00:37:55.610 --> 00:38:00.990
David Schaich (he): And here we can actually be a bit more general. and

382
00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:10.710
David Schaich (he): step away from the micro canonical ensemble specifically. and consider a more generic

383
00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.150
David Schaich (he): statistical ensemble

384
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:19.610
David Schaich (he): getting, call it Omega.

385
00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:24.940
David Schaich (he): And for simplicity.

386
00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:30.210
David Schaich (he): You will again assume that it has accountable number

387
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.050
David Schaich (he): of microstates.

388
00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.920
David Schaich (he): and again call that number

389
00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:41.560
David Schaich (he): a capital M.

390
00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.330
David Schaich (he): And the entropy of this statistical

391
00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:48.920
David Schaich (he): ensemble

392
00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:52.640
David Schaich (he): is defined to be

393
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:58.390
David Schaich (he): be some over all of those microstates

394
00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:12.710
David Schaich (he): the corresponding probability that the system realizes the microstates times. the model of that same probability. the overall negative sign. So I use

395
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:23.660
David Schaich (he): capital. S is the symbol for entropy. and it remind you that. and I write log I mean the the natural one with base e sometimes written Ln.

396
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.900
David Schaich (he): And it's a convention to

397
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.100
David Schaich (he): use E as the default base

398
00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.060
David Schaich (he): for the more with them, unless

399
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.190
David Schaich (he): unless otherwise stated.

400
00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.380
David Schaich (he): Now for you specialize

401
00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:51.310
David Schaich (he): from a generic statistical ensemble to that micro canonical ensemble.

402
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.630
David Schaich (he): and further specialize

403
00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.660
David Schaich (he): my

404
00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:03.760
David Schaich (he): demanding that

405
00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.530
David Schaich (he): ensemble is in equilibrium.

406
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.750
David Schaich (he): And then this expression simplifies

407
00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:15.080
significantly the probabilities pi

408
00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:24.760
David Schaich (he): all constant. so every term in the some is identical with some itself. just becomes an overall back to him.

409
00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:26.900
David Schaich (he): So we have

410
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:31.210
David Schaich (he): like overall them from something over him Terms.

411
00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:43.540
David Schaich (he): Yeah. P. I. Out fronts one over n that. We have the log of one over m. So those factors cancel.

412
00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:48.650
David Schaich (he): The entropy is just negative one over N, which

413
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:56.120
David Schaich (he): see the properties of logarithms is just the walker of them of the number of microstates that we have, and I should say

414
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.350
David Schaich (he): here before we g0 0n any further comment I

415
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:05.940
David Schaich (he): meant to make early on is that in this

416
00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:07.220
David Schaich (he): module one

417
00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:14.860
David Schaich (he): and we'll be focusing almost exclusively on equilibrium. Statistical physics. Things become much smaller

418
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:17.250
in non equilibrium settings.

419
00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.200
David Schaich (he): and that's

420
00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:21.860
David Schaich (he): a good topic for a second module in Cisco physics.

421
00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:22.960
David Schaich (he): But

422
00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:34.810
David Schaich (he): in this module equilibrium behavior it is going to be essentially our still focus.

423
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:44.320
David Schaich (he): So it is possible that some of you may recognize

424
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:49.540
David Schaich (he): this expression at S. Equals a logarithm of a number of microstates.

425
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:53.410
David Schaich (he): as what it's called Boltzmann's equation.

426
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:04.250
David Schaich (he): It is actually carved into Boltzmann's tombstone

427
00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.010
in Berlin, using different

428
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:18.360
David Schaich (he): terminology one of the famous foundations of statistical physics that was with recording it. Yes.

429
00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:25.780
David Schaich (he): among men about Boltzmann's many contributions to physics. This is the one that got carved into his gravestone.

430
00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:29.720
David Schaich (he): and

431
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:33.070
David Schaich (he): if we recall that

432
00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.440
David Schaich (he): in the micro canonical setting

433
00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:43.110
David Schaich (he): you have

434
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:51.170
David Schaich (he): the energy and critical number, and

435
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:53.940
David Schaich (he): and we consider that

436
00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.910
David Schaich (he): you getting back t0 0ur

437
00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.380
David Schaich (he): oh conceptual

438
00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:00.870
David Schaich (he): idea of

439
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.430
David Schaich (he): we expect.

440
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.530
David Schaich (he): drive quantities like

441
00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.970
David Schaich (he): the entropy and the temperature that is

442
00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.100
David Schaich (he): coming up soon.

443
00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:32.940
David Schaich (he): These are just the properties of the system that we expect to be steady and stable as time goes on, and the equilibrium system continues

444
00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:39.210
David Schaich (he): switching from microstate to microstates. So they're sitting in stable, even though

445
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.580
David Schaich (he): the

446
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:51.170
David Schaich (he): system is dynamic dynamically adopted

447
00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:55.250
David Schaich (he): different micro states.

448
00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.170
David Schaich (he): And what we can

449
00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:04.230
David Schaich (he): conclude I.

450
00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.890
David Schaich (he): This consideration

451
00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.280
David Schaich (he): is that

452
00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:13.460
David Schaich (he): the entropy, rather than depending strongly on

453
00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:16.190
one microstate to the next

454
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.600
David Schaich (he): instead, is a function I would be

455
00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:32.950
David Schaich (he): part of that, we know are steady and stable, and, in fact conserved the micro canonical context.

456
00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.520
David Schaich (he): When you leave the you

457
00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:45.340
David Schaich (he): energy and the particle number. So we can write the entropy as

458
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:51.000
David Schaich (he): a function of energy and particle number, and from Boltzmann's equation

459
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:52.930
David Schaich (he): include that

460
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:57.280
David Schaich (he): all of the energy, particle, number, and

461
00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.190
David Schaich (he): number of microstates that determines the entropy.

462
00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:07.100
David Schaich (he): Oh. I went to the related in such a way that

463
00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:16.250
David Schaich (he): it's derived quantity. The entropy is just a function of it could serve quantities to your energy and particle number.

464
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:25.340
David Schaich (he): So, to illustrate

465
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.940
David Schaich (he): this conclusion. we can turn back to

466
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.310
David Schaich (he): our spin system. Use that to

467
00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:40.950
David Schaich (he): work through a.

468
00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:50.100
David Schaich (he): Do you want simple examples. the entropy, and how it it's connected to energy and particle number?

469
00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.160
David Schaich (he): So

470
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:57.630
David Schaich (he): again, considering and spins. if we

471
00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:06.380
David Schaich (he): sent that external magnetic field t0 0. In other words, we turn off the external field.

472
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:14.080
David Schaich (he): so that all of the configurations of these and spins.

473
00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.930
so all of the

474
00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:21.380
David Schaich (he): 2 to the end possible. Microstates

475
00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:28.840
David Schaich (he): have the same energy, namely.

476
00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:39.290
David Schaich (he): equals 0, and we can recognize that our M is just 2 to the end and your enterprise.

477
00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:42.290
David Schaich (he): This one of them

478
00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:50.960
David Schaich (he): is that logarithm of 2 in the end, or again, using properties of logarithms and times the log of 2,

479
00:46:57.490 --> 00:46:58.740
David Schaich (he): and

480
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:07.110
David Schaich (he): we can next. So that is sort of trivial case where

481
00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.730
David Schaich (he): every single microstate in the system

482
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:14.490
David Schaich (he): that's the same energy, it is accessible in the micro economic.

483
00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.450
David Schaich (he): But if we for that.

484
00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:33.080
David Schaich (he): give it a day positive magnitude corresponding to orientation, pointing upward. and

485
00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:39.230
David Schaich (he): consider that the

486
00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:44.550
David Schaich (he): it is still possible to have

487
00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:50.310
David Schaich (he): the energy vanish with a non-zero magnetic field.

488
00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:56.030
David Schaich (he): But this is only the

489
00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:10.570
David Schaich (he): this energy only vanishes. If the number of upper pointing spins with a negative contribution to the energy is equal to the number of down recording spins with the positive contribution to the energy.

490
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:23.190
David Schaich (he): and you will have now a different value for the entropy

491
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:26.940
David Schaich (he): in this situation

492
00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:30.770
David Schaich (he): compared to when we had the magnetic field for Doll.

493
00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:35.000
David Schaich (he): so that all spins, regardless of n plus and and minus.

494
00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.840
David Schaich (he): have that same vanishing energy.

495
00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:42.220
David Schaich (he): I'm taking a look at the time. I

496
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:48.450
David Schaich (he): thank you. I can leave this question with you. Think. hey?

497
00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.560
David Schaich (he): Brief break and

498
00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:54.930
David Schaich (he): come back at the 10 answer this question.

499
00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:59.400
David Schaich (he): and then move on into the second law of thermodynamics.

500
00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.360
David Schaich (he): which is.

501
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:03.950
David Schaich (he): you might know, intimately connected to the entropy

502
00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:07.270
David Schaich (he): any questions Before I pause the recording

503
00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:22.270
David Schaich (he): right well reconvene that at 10, and that for zoom recording.

504
00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:29.080
David Schaich (he): And I believe this was a straightforward question. Given the

505
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:37.830
David Schaich (he): simpler example we had already going through looking at the traction of microstates.

506
00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:52.340
David Schaich (he): the entropy it's the logarithm of the number of microstates. and

507
00:49:54.190 --> 00:50:02.440
David Schaich (he): demanding that an energy of 0 is the conservative value it's required by the microcontroller.

508
00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:03.760
David Schaich (he): We know that

509
00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:11.810
David Schaich (he): there are and choose and plus spin configurations

510
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:17.900
David Schaich (he): with the given value of energy. We are now in the total number of spins.

511
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:27.680
David Schaich (he): You see it number up reporting plus the number gallon porting. Since those numbers are equal with the energy equal t0 0.

512
00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:30.240
David Schaich (he): We know that

513
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:34.410
David Schaich (he): 0 energy is the same as saying that

514
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:40.710
David Schaich (he): n plus is exactly one half of the total number of space

515
00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:45.720
David Schaich (he): which has to be even in order for the energy to be 0 in the first place, so.

516
00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:49.050
David Schaich (he): and it's 2 and plus

517
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:56.050
David Schaich (he): choose n plus. which is the rati0 0f

518
00:50:57.730 --> 00:50:59.780
2 and plus factorial

519
00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:00.970
David Schaich (he): over

520
00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:05.940
David Schaich (he): 2 powers of n plus factorial. So that plus factorial square.

521
00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.300
David Schaich (he): And then

522
00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:13.700
David Schaich (he): there's not really much we can do to simplify that we can just plug it in

523
00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:24.770
David Schaich (he): 2. Boltzmann's equation for the entropy. We have to log 2 and plus back to

524
00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:33.670
David Schaich (he): over and plus factorial squared. and help yourself the logarithm and

525
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:48.910
David Schaich (he): make this slightly more elegant. but still bit of a mouthful of I. Yes, you, too. shouting out, we get the log of 2 n factorial minus twice the log

526
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:50.940
David Schaich (he): up and plus factorial.

527
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:56.620
David Schaich (he): Later on we will bring Sterling's formula to there to

528
00:51:57.610 --> 00:52:03.530
David Schaich (he): make more. You have expressions like this. They will come up again just based on.

529
00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:16.000
David Schaich (he): In fact, that's statistical. Physics derives from the behavior of a large number of molecules. But for now we can leave that as it is perhaps get back to

530
00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.360
David Schaich (he): the

531
00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:32.120
David Schaich (he): N. Equals 8 that we were looking at earlier. At first consideration of the fraction so. and plus and and minus are both, for in order for the energy to be 0,

532
00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:33.390
and

533
00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:34.860
David Schaich (he): the entropy

534
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:40.120
David Schaich (he): is just the one of

535
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.390
David Schaich (he): 2, and plus so

536
00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.590
David Schaich (he): page

537
00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:45.090
pictorial

538
00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:46.880
David Schaich (he): it's divided by

539
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:52.520
David Schaich (he): 2 powers of in plus factorial 4 factorial

540
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.740
David Schaich (he): times the 4 factorial.

541
00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:00.430
David Schaich (he): So. as we were seeing with the fraction earlier, we have

542
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:07.530
David Schaich (he): 8 7 6 5 from the vectorial. Everything else cancels off one of those 4 factorials.

543
00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:22.550
David Schaich (he): hey? The other 4 factorial is left 4 times 2 chances of the aids. 3 takes off, though half of the 6. So that's a factor of 2 times

544
00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:35.680
David Schaich (he): 5 times 7, s0 35 times 2 is the 170. So the number of Microsoft's and the 70. The entropy is a small and S. We can note that

545
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:45.540
David Schaich (he): 70 is no more than double the number of microstates that we had in the earlier example, when we had a negative energy from

546
00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:57.870
David Schaich (he): 6 spins pointing up, and only 2 down. and there will be a tutorial activity that explorers that behavior in more detail. It connected to

547
00:53:57.990 --> 00:54:00.410
David Schaich (he): the second law of thermodynamics.

548
00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:05.460
David Schaich (he): But for now you but all

549
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:10.120
David Schaich (he): well, actually, you have to introduce that second law before, say much about us.

550
00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:14.170
David Schaich (he): S0 0ne thing. 2,

551
00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:18.220
David Schaich (he): no, about the

552
00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.140
David Schaich (he): entropy and the number of

553
00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:24.610
microstates, and

554
00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:26.050
David Schaich (he): is that

555
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:31.730
David Schaich (he): if we we've been considering a finite and for

556
00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:39.030
David Schaich (he): simplicity. If you were to consider the limits that M. Goes to infinity

557
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:52.110
David Schaich (he): which is not really physical, because we always have a finite number of physical degrees of freedom that can only take a finite number of configurations. But mathematically we can

558
00:54:52.850 --> 00:54:55.490
David Schaich (he): no to that. Yes.

559
00:54:56.890 --> 00:55:04.630
David Schaich (he): just a lot of, and also grows with outbound in the limit that we have an infinite number of microstates.

560
00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.970
David Schaich (he): and this is a infection of

561
00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:14.210
David Schaich (he): a of the entropy that is called

562
00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:21.300
David Schaich (he): so. We can save. The entropy is. and extensive

563
00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:31.130
David Schaich (he): quantity. and the formal definition of what it means to be extensive comes from

564
00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:37.340
David Schaich (he): the behavior of the entropy. If we consider to

565
00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:41.000
David Schaich (he): isolated micro

566
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:44.260
David Schaich (he): systems.

567
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:47.530
David Schaich (he): So i'll say we have

568
00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:55.500
David Schaich (he): so spin system off on the left as

569
00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:07.780
David Schaich (he): some background, and then, like, Feel H. That gives you the conserved energy. e. One conservative particle number and one in this case 6 spins.

570
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:14.270
David Schaich (he): and I will a box around that to

571
00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:21.660
David Schaich (he): note that it is isolated from so a second spin system. you know. You can hang it up

572
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:36.560
David Schaich (he): up to the right. We have a different energy into a different number of particles into this for simplicity. I suppose that both of these systems have

573
00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.820
David Schaich (he): the same magnetic field

574
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:52.460
David Schaich (he): in the background to define their energies on the call that one that can be System Omega 2.

575
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:54.650
David Schaich (he): And

576
00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.560
David Schaich (he): the entropy of

577
00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:04.510
David Schaich (he): each of these systems is coming from the corresponding number of microstates.

578
00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:06.860
David Schaich (he): each of which

579
00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:11.490
David Schaich (he): he was

580
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:15.300
David Schaich (he): corresponding probabilities.

581
00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:21.800
David Schaich (he): And to be general, I actually don't need to specify that, or Don't need to

582
00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:33.000
David Schaich (he): assume These are micro canonical or in equilibrium. You can write down the general expression for the entropy.

583
00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:43.420
David Schaich (he): It's the sum over all these and one microstates of the probabilities. P. I. Similarly for

584
00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.360
David Schaich (he): system 2

585
00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:50.040
David Schaich (he): just to

586
00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:54.950
David Schaich (he): distinguished 2 systems. I will say that the

587
00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:01.800
David Schaich (he): probabilities of system 2 are Q. K. For each of the M. 2 micro states

588
00:58:02.330 --> 00:58:05.620
David Schaich (he): and the entropy of System 2.

589
00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:16.680
David Schaich (he): It's the same. Okay. Equals one up to m 2. Oh, now Q. K. Log, Uk.

590
00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:31.290
David Schaich (he): And what we are going to do now is. take these 2 systems keep them isolated, so not actually change anything. but think about them or analyze them.

591
00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:35.860
David Schaich (he): And a single combined system.

592
00:58:41.790 --> 00:58:49.270
David Schaich (he): you know, Mega one plus 2. So the idea is, we take these 2 systems and just draw.

593
00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:55.530
David Schaich (he): hey? Yes, box around them.

594
00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:02.590
David Schaich (he): Illustrate that. We what to think of them as

595
00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:14.090
David Schaich (he): he combined system made up of now 2 subsystems. I'll make a one and Don't make it to. And

596
00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:18.800
David Schaich (he): the question to consider is, what is the entropy

597
00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:21.430
David Schaich (he): of the system, or as the first step.

598
00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:25.300
David Schaich (he): How many

599
00:59:26.550 --> 00:59:33.670
David Schaich (he): microstates to the combined system panel? If we could call that s0 0ne plus 2,

600
00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:37.140
David Schaich (he): See? Yeah.

601
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:49.490
David Schaich (he): And hello.

602
00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:55.730
David Schaich (he): The answer to this question is easier than it might look at first glance.

603
00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:05.150
David Schaich (he): Yes. thanks to the fact that the 2 subsystems are kept isolated.

604
01:00:09.090 --> 01:00:14.190
David Schaich (he): and therefore have the property of statistical independence.

605
01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:29.130
David Schaich (he): and spell out this property in words. If we

606
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:34.200
David Schaich (he): system one in one of its micro States.

607
01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:42.010
David Schaich (he): Omega, I then system 2 could be in any one of its m 2

608
01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.630
David Schaich (he): microstates.

609
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:46.850
David Schaich (he): So

610
01:00:49.850 --> 01:01:00.410
David Schaich (he): for each oh, bigger I of system one. There are M. 2 microstates. The system 2 could be in and repeating that for each of the

611
01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.230
David Schaich (he): and one microstates will make a I,

612
01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:12.040
David Schaich (he): and quickly concluded that the total number of microstates is the product

613
01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:23.700
David Schaich (he): of am few microstates for each of the M. One microstates of the 2 subsystems independently. Is that clear?

614
01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:26.910
David Schaich (he): N0 0bjections?

615
01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:35.780
David Schaich (he): I can also go further, and note that again, because the systems are isolated, specifically independent.

616
01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:41.570
David Schaich (he): The probability of each of these M. One times M. 2 microstates.

617
01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:44.620
David Schaich (he): It's just the

618
01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:55.390
David Schaich (he): correct the probability. P: oh, yeah. The first system is in microstate Omega I. I. The probability. Q. K.

619
01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:02.090
David Schaich (he): The second system being in the corresponding microstate.

620
01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:07.160
David Schaich (he): the overall probabilities of the

621
01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:13.310
David Schaich (he): I find system, Omega one plus 2 00ps, the

622
01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.320
David Schaich (he): following the screen there. that is again just the product.

623
01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:21.270
David Schaich (he): P. I. At times. Qk.

624
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:33.530
David Schaich (he): So say, if there's a 10% chance of just a one being in one system. a percent chance of system to being in another state. The chances of both of those things happening at once

625
01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:35.570
is the product and the possibilities

626
01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:40.090
David Schaich (he): 10%. So

627
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:44.560
David Schaich (he): nothing here that you haven't seen in other contexts.

628
01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.700
David Schaich (he): But

629
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.800
David Schaich (he): just to check that

630
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:55.930
David Schaich (he): everything we've done so far is staying. you can

631
01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:59.060
David Schaich (he): consider the sum over all

632
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.390
David Schaich (he): those

633
01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:12.390
David Schaich (he): and one plus 2 states of the 2 systems being analyzed together. the probability of each of the States is P. I.

634
01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:21.600
David Schaich (he): Okay. Instead of breaking up this song into sum over M. One index by I.

635
01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:25.080
David Schaich (he): S0 0ver and 2

636
01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:27.330
David Schaich (he): indexed by K.

637
01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:40.650
David Schaich (he): Well, T: Audience: Independence. Okay. It can be pulled out into you. Separate some.

638
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:54.470
David Schaich (he): and then some over K. And the involves Qk. We've said. Both of these are well defined probabilities so separately that you had up t0 0ne.

639
01:03:55.990 --> 01:04:05.890
David Schaich (he): So we have the P. Some over. The combined system of this probabilities is adding up t0 0ne times one equals one as it should.

640
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:12.410
David Schaich (he): The entropy is slightly less trivial. so

641
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:17.260
David Schaich (he): calling that

642
01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:20.520
David Schaich (he): has s0 0ne plus 2,

643
01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:24.750
David Schaich (he): we have to again, not assuming

644
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:34.310
David Schaich (he): equilibrium or micro economical ensemble, we use the general formula again, something over all of the microstates. I and K.

645
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:46.360
David Schaich (he): And M. One plus 2. The probability of each of those is P. IQ. K. Then we have the log. P. I. Q. K.

646
01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:50.350
David Schaich (he): And Yeah.

647
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:55.190
David Schaich (he): Property of the one that the one of the product is the sum of logs.

648
01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:59.690
David Schaich (he): This lets us rewrite this immediately, as

649
01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:04.150
David Schaich (he): P. I. Q. K. I'm.

650
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.740
David Schaich (he): A law api plus along the Uk.

651
01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:18.420
David Schaich (he): And just as we did when checking the probabilities. we can group together the

652
01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:23.700
David Schaich (he): terms that depend on I and K. Separately. So this first term

653
01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:37.270
David Schaich (he): we have a Yeah. I am one P. I. And there's only a Q. That depends on K. In the second term you only have.

654
01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:44.710
David Schaich (he): Api. That depends on. Are you everything else? The Uk.

655
01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:48.100
David Schaich (he): Log. Q. K.

656
01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:50.930
These sums are again

657
01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:53.490
David Schaich (he): going to

658
01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:55.680
David Schaich (he): well.

659
01:05:56.980 --> 01:06:08.480
David Schaich (he): so we can recognize that we have 2 terms in the entropy. What is the minus? Some of I, which was

660
01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:12.590
David Schaich (he): just at the top of the screen. There the entropy.

661
01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.150
David Schaich (he): this one.

662
01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:22.190
David Schaich (he): and then the second term it's also the top of the screen, and it's sum over K. Q. K.

663
01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:26.590
David Schaich (he): So this

664
01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:33.570
David Schaich (he): you saying that the entropy of the combined system is just the sum of the entropies

665
01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:46.600
David Schaich (he): of its independent subsystems. And this is, in fact, the formal definition. all that an extensive quality. so the extensive entropy

666
01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:51.920
David Schaich (he): is characterized by

667
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.760
David Schaich (he): the

668
01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.530
David Schaich (he): overall entropy, and adding up

669
01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:02.620
David Schaich (he): across independent subsystems.

670
01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:13.230
David Schaich (he): and I think you'll leave me if I just tell you that the

671
01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:19.290
David Schaich (he): energy and particle number behave the same way. If you want to look at the

672
01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:27.940
David Schaich (he): energy of the combined system. It's just to be some of the energy. and similarly for

673
01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:30.040
David Schaich (he): a portable number.

674
01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:44.850
David Schaich (he): just as an aside. Not everything behaves this way. There are also intensive qualities

675
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:50.460
David Schaich (he): bottom of the page here.

676
01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:59.280
David Schaich (he): and rather than adding up the cost. Independent subsystems, intensive qualities are defined to be

677
01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:00.690
David Schaich (he): independence

678
01:08:03.930 --> 01:08:06.660
David Schaich (he): of the system, size, or the extent

679
01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:09.890
David Schaich (he): of the system.

680
01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:19.930
David Schaich (he): Once we get to temperature, that will be one example. it will be i'm, buying

681
01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:25.689
David Schaich (he): 2 glasses of water we don't end up with a temperature of a combined class of water that is twice

682
01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:33.500
David Schaich (he): just have to yourself those system subsystem to start off with the density. is another

683
01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:39.180
example of an intensive quality that is independent of

684
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:46.540
David Schaich (he): the size of the subsystem, and it's also possible to be neither intensive nor extensive If we saw that the

685
01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:57.050
David Schaich (he): number of micro states on that combined system. What's the product? Oh, yeah. The microstates of the 2 subsystems independently.

686
01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:02.080
David Schaich (he): and that is

687
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:08.240
David Schaich (he): neither independent of the extent of the system, so it's not intensive.

688
01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:13.330
David Schaich (he): nor is it adding up the way that the energy in the entropy to

689
01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.200
David Schaich (he): so it's not the case that

690
01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:27.300
David Schaich (he): all properties fall into those 2 categories. There are got her behaviors that are

691
01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:30.790
possible.

692
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:42.510
David Schaich (he): I will say, just as a maybe a quick wrap up of

693
01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:48.290
David Schaich (he): this thought experiments of taking 2 subsystems and analyzing them as a

694
01:09:48.529 --> 01:09:49.750
David Schaich (he): a single

695
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:52.540
David Schaich (he): combined system.

696
01:09:53.029 --> 01:09:54.189
David Schaich (he): that

697
01:09:57.550 --> 01:10:00.580
David Schaich (he): if we were to suppose

698
01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.090
David Schaich (he): that

699
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:05.910
David Schaich (he): you do require

700
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:16.230
David Schaich (he): that you should be subsystems is independently.

701
01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:29.330
David Schaich (he): You call the deal.

702
01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:32.830
David Schaich (he): Then we know that

703
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:38.940
David Schaich (he): the probabilities beyond I just one over and one all equal.

704
01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:44.340
David Schaich (he): I will use Qk also, all in one over and 2

705
01:10:45.370 --> 01:10:46.810
David Schaich (he): so s one

706
01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:51.640
David Schaich (he): as to as the

707
01:10:55.900 --> 01:11:08.940
David Schaich (he): assuming it's a dynamic equilibrium. and the combined probability I Uk, then. is just the product of one over M one

708
01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:17.510
David Schaich (he): times one over m 2 which we can recognize as what, over the total number of microstates of that combined system

709
01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:26.290
David Schaich (he): which how about that? Maybe not surprisingly. The combined system is also.

710
01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:38.370
if it's

711
01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:47.140
David Schaich (he): independence. Subsystems are already in equilibrium, and the conversation only combined entropy

712
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:52.850
David Schaich (he): simpler in this setting.

713
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:55.300
and one plus 2.

714
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:59.170
David Schaich (he): It's just the product. and one times them to

715
01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:13.160
David Schaich (he): so properly for the long immediately related to the individual entropies of those 2 subsystems. So that's all working out as expected in

716
01:12:13.450 --> 01:12:20.650
David Schaich (he): the more specific. Somebody simplified it. Situation that we do. Well

717
01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:24.270
David Schaich (he): demand thermodynamic equilibrium.

718
01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:30.180
David Schaich (he): There's one other interesting thing we can do

719
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:37.000
David Schaich (he): with these 2 systems. and that is.

720
01:12:41.410 --> 01:12:51.710
David Schaich (he): put them together in a more intimate sense. and allow them to exchange energy. Let me analyze it together. I'll refer to this as

721
01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.940
David Schaich (he): putting the systems into no contact.

722
01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:04.290
David Schaich (he): so we will keep those

723
01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.350
David Schaich (he): same 2 subsystems

724
01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.040
David Schaich (he): and the them

725
01:13:12.230 --> 01:13:14.710
David Schaich (he): to exchange energy back and forth.

726
01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:22.930
David Schaich (he): but for simplicity.

727
01:13:24.190 --> 01:13:30.100
David Schaich (he): demand that particle number in each subsystem save the same.

728
01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:33.120
David Schaich (he): And you'll also

729
01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.040
demand that the

730
01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.910
David Schaich (he): overall system that

731
01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:44.460
this

732
01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:54.020
David Schaich (he): procedure produces does reach equilibrium which may require. You know we wait for some time

733
01:13:55.490 --> 01:14:04.720
David Schaich (he): after introducing. s0 0n the contract. So if I redraw 2 systems now right next to each other.

734
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:09.120
David Schaich (he): but still with a wall in between, that is.

735
01:14:09.170 --> 01:14:18.720
David Schaich (he): keeping the particles in one from hopping over into the other.

736
01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:30.250
David Schaich (he): We still have n one particles and system, one and 2, and the other system. You'll have that same

737
01:14:32.690 --> 01:14:37.570
David Schaich (he): constant external background. Feel. But now

738
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:44.860
David Schaich (he): we allow energy to flow back and forth between these 2 systems, much like

739
01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:50.450
David Schaich (he): say energy, but not particles can flow through the windows in this room. So this is

740
01:14:51.630 --> 01:14:53.920
David Schaich (he): nothing out of the ordinary.

741
01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:59.490
David Schaich (he): And we call this overall system

742
01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:03.560
David Schaich (he): with thrill of contact. Omega. And this note that

743
01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:06.360
David Schaich (he): this system, Omega.

744
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:16.820
David Schaich (he): is not the same. has that combined system on it. I'll make it one plus 2 that we analyzed after the break.

745
01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:28.820
David Schaich (he): What we do have is that the total energy? Just recently

746
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:37.820
David Schaich (he): some of the original e one plus e 2. I was initially in each of the subsystems before they were brought together and allowed to exchange energy.

747
01:15:38.170 --> 01:15:39.610
David Schaich (he): The total area

748
01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:42.810
David Schaich (he): is still conserved.

749
01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.580
David Schaich (he): So the overall

750
01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:50.400
David Schaich (he): a micro canonical system

751
01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:56.310
David Schaich (he): described by the micro canonical ensemble.

752
01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:59.350
But the individual subsystems

753
01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.530
David Schaich (he): no longer are

754
01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:09.030
David Schaich (he): because their energy and change.

755
01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.790
David Schaich (he): and they correlated with the total sum of their energies.

756
01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.530
David Schaich (he): always adds up to

757
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:18.260
David Schaich (he): the conserved.

758
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:22.110
David Schaich (he): So again.

759
01:16:22.650 --> 01:16:26.400
we're talking about the entropy, and so it comes as no surprise, and we want to

760
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:29.050
David Schaich (he): think about the entropy for

761
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:32.450
David Schaich (he): this now overall system. That is not the same.

762
01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:37.700
David Schaich (he): It's the combination of 2 independent subsystems. So the energy is no longer going to be

763
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:46.680
David Schaich (he): just to some, or at least we can't make that assumption we got to. We do the computation of the total number of microstates.

764
01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:52.090
David Schaich (he): the log of which they'll give us

765
01:16:53.190 --> 01:16:54.400
David Schaich (he): you can for P.

766
01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:13.360
David Schaich (he): So the total number of microstates for the overall system, Omega with thermal contact is

767
01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:21.780
David Schaich (he): easier to compute because the substant, those 2 size are no longer independent, no longer isolated subsystems.

768
01:17:22.330 --> 01:17:27.090
David Schaich (he): and what we have to do is make use of energy conservation.

769
01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:44.600
David Schaich (he): And what this tells us is that if see the N. One spins on the left. make some contribution. We'll call lowercase e to the total energy.

770
01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:49.610
David Schaich (he): Then the remaining and 2 spins on the right

771
01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:54.810
David Schaich (he): must provide the remainder at capital E. Minus this

772
01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:56.780
David Schaich (he): lower ace i.

773
01:18:03.090 --> 01:18:04.160
David Schaich (he): So the

774
01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:14.370
David Schaich (he): whole number of microstates that we would have in this situation. If we fix the contribution lowercase e one. then

775
01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:16.390
David Schaich (he): we get

776
01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:20.170
David Schaich (he): the product of

777
01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:27.750
David Schaich (he): the number of microstates, the number of ways there are for those n one spins to have energy in one call that

778
01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:32.020
David Schaich (he): M. So E. One. and that it's multiplying

779
01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:45.690
David Schaich (he): by a total number of ways 4, the and 2 spins to provide the remaining energy. So the capital, the minus you want.

780
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:53.990
David Schaich (he): so that so far we've not said anything to

781
01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:57.250
David Schaich (he): shocking or really too helpful, because we don't

782
01:18:57.930 --> 01:19:08.940
David Schaich (he): necessarily know all of the values of this lower case. E. One that those n one students could take what we what we do know is that

783
01:19:10.190 --> 01:19:13.090
David Schaich (he): it is possible for

784
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:21.020
David Schaich (he): this lower case, e. One

785
01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.140
David Schaich (he): to be the capital, a one.

786
01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.020
David Schaich (he): The energy of

787
01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:39.580
David Schaich (he): the set of N. One spins all the while they were still independent and isolated from the other subsystem before, from the contact goes to that one. So this is one possibility.

788
01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.230
not necessarily the only one.

789
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:44.810
David Schaich (he): But when

790
01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:49.680
David Schaich (he): that possibility is realized. all right

791
01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:54.730
David Schaich (he): consideration of the total number of microstates accounts

792
01:19:57.330 --> 01:19:58.230
David Schaich (he): the world

793
01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.760
David Schaich (he): Oh.

794
01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.480
David Schaich (he): on the M one plus 2, which was just m one

795
01:20:07.690 --> 01:20:18.880
David Schaich (he): times m 2 and one. Now is the number of ways the n one spins and have energy e one

796
01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.480
David Schaich (he): and again.

797
01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:24.250
David Schaich (he): and 2 spins

798
01:20:25.930 --> 01:20:31.240
David Schaich (he): are the number of ways. Sorry, m. 2 is the number of ways to, and 2 spins can have energy.

799
01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:35.020
David Schaich (he): E minus e, one, which is capital E. 2

800
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:37.860
David Schaich (he): so

801
01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:47.430
David Schaich (he): overall. This allows us to say that total number of microstates and I, for we'll make it itself.

802
01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:52.790
David Schaich (he): This is the some of all possible values, that

803
01:20:53.190 --> 01:20:57.810
David Schaich (he): all possible ways we can distribute the total energy between 2 sets of spins.

804
01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:04.500
David Schaich (he): So all possible can I use that the and one spins are contributing, which fixes and 2 contribution.

805
01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.360
David Schaich (he): So I've seen that.

806
01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:12.700
David Schaich (he): and is the

807
01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.870
or given e one.

808
01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:27.420
David Schaich (he): we do it. M. 71 is the product that we wrote down earlier. and we can pull out the particular case where e equals capital e one

809
01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:29.040
David Schaich (he): which we know is possible.

810
01:21:30.810 --> 01:21:33.990
David Schaich (he): It is our m one plus m 2,

811
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:38.620
and then we still have some over all the other possibilities where

812
01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:44.140
David Schaich (he): lowercase e one is not equal to the upper case. Even when we started off with

813
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.060
David Schaich (he): same

814
01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:53.200
David Schaich (he): expression in That's a song.

815
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:59.220
David Schaich (he): and because a number of microstates is always a non-negative quality

816
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:13.020
David Schaich (he): we know that this has to be greater than or equal to the first term. The some can only increase this whole number. and that decreases.

817
01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:16.470
David Schaich (he): and

818
01:22:19.330 --> 01:22:23.050
David Schaich (he): although I've written a greater than or equals to sign

819
01:22:24.650 --> 01:22:26.960
David Schaich (he): at the bottom range

820
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:32.930
David Schaich (he): of the docking. I'll mention that the quality only holds

821
01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:39.070
David Schaich (he): in extremely special cases.

822
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:48.520
and only

823
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:53.690
David Schaich (he): in the extremely special case. Yeah, E: one

824
01:22:56.510 --> 01:23:00.280
David Schaich (he): and you 2 are the only possible values

825
01:23:01.690 --> 01:23:02.570
David Schaich (he): that

826
01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:12.570
David Schaich (he): the 2 sets of spins can contribute to the total energy.

827
01:23:14.050 --> 01:23:17.610
David Schaich (he): In other words, even though you allow some of the contacts.

828
01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:21.250
David Schaich (he): the system is set up in such a way that

829
01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:24.460
it can't make use of that triple contact.

830
01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:33.510
David Schaich (he): For instance, if all of the spins were pointing. Oh, so both of the systems have the almost negative possible energy.

831
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:39.680
David Schaich (he): and there's no way for either of them to change their energy in such a way that they

832
01:23:39.710 --> 01:23:43.190
David Schaich (he): totally energy is conserved.

833
01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:49.150
David Schaich (he): And similarly, when all the spins are pointing down so that they have the

834
01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:54.580
David Schaich (he): largest possible positive energy. There's similarly no way for any energy to be

835
01:23:54.590 --> 01:24:05.360
David Schaich (he): exchanged that would satisfy the overall energy conservation of that system, Omega. So those are the 2 extremely special special cases

836
01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:12.640
David Schaich (he): where yes. inequality would be.

837
01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:17.790
David Schaich (he): You become an equality, and

838
01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:20.820
David Schaich (he): and it wouldn't matter whether or not we allowed

839
01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:23.430
David Schaich (he): normal contact. In the first place.

840
01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:26.340
David Schaich (he): maybe just to.

841
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.220
David Schaich (he): We state things we can

842
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:34.800
David Schaich (he): so

843
01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:38.700
David Schaich (he): based on that

844
01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:42.730
David Schaich (he): and the total number of microstates for

845
01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:45.770
David Schaich (he): this overall system being

846
01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:57.290
David Schaich (he): at least equal to, and almost always greater than

847
01:24:59.040 --> 01:24:59.940
David Schaich (he): the

848
01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:05.560
David Schaich (he): product of the microstates of the 2 subsystems when they were independent.

849
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:07.930
David Schaich (he): If we assume

850
01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:10.780
David Schaich (he): so dynamic equilibrium.

851
01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:17.100
David Schaich (he): then the corresponding entropy. it's just the

852
01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:20.410
David Schaich (he): lord of the capital M.

853
01:25:21.090 --> 01:25:31.110
David Schaich (he): He is greater than or equal to the log of M. One times m 2 which we saw was yes, one plus 2

854
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:36.150
David Schaich (he): of the combined system where the cell systems were kept

855
01:25:36.170 --> 01:25:39.560
David Schaich (he): isolated and statistically independent, and again.

856
01:25:41.290 --> 01:25:45.470
David Schaich (he): almost always an inequality quality, holding only in

857
01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:49.640
David Schaich (he): unusual and special cases.

858
01:25:50.710 --> 01:25:54.140
David Schaich (he): and what this is is a cool.

859
01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:58.170
David Schaich (he): the second law

860
01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:01.640
David Schaich (he): of thermodynamics

861
01:26:02.770 --> 01:26:06.740
David Schaich (he): which we have to ride just from a thought experiment.

862
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:09.470
David Schaich (he): I was taking 2

863
01:26:10.690 --> 01:26:13.260
David Schaich (he): systems and bringing them into contact.

864
01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:17.420
David Schaich (he): So to

865
01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:21.570
David Schaich (he): I'm. A formerly state the second wall of

866
01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:27.230
David Schaich (he): when isolated systems.

867
01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:32.360
David Schaich (he): i'm sure each

868
01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:35.730
David Schaich (he): you want dynamic equilibrium.

869
01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:39.700
David Schaich (he): which I should

870
01:26:39.970 --> 01:26:43.490
David Schaich (he): to specify. Here it was equilibrium that

871
01:26:44.230 --> 01:26:53.930
David Schaich (he): allowed us to bring to bear the relation that Boltzmann's equation. The entropy is one of the microstates, so we are, as usual, assuming for an

872
01:26:54.820 --> 01:27:00.140
David Schaich (he): so when isolated systems, and to dynamic equilibrium. I brought

873
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:09.390
David Schaich (he): into thermal contact and allowed to exchange energy with each other

874
01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:14.410
David Schaich (he): in the entropy

875
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:18.340
David Schaich (he): S is greater than or equal to

876
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:20.350
David Schaich (he): the

877
01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:27.350
David Schaich (he): some of the individual entropies of those initially isolated systems.

878
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:28.820
David Schaich (he): so it

879
01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:32.900
David Schaich (he): the overall energy with thermal contact

880
01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:39.430
David Schaich (he): it never decreased compared to the initially isolated systems. And

881
01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:43.280
David Schaich (he): you can also add, in parentheses that

882
01:27:45.710 --> 01:27:49.950
David Schaich (he): generically the entropy will increase except

883
01:27:52.150 --> 01:27:54.460
David Schaich (he): in extremely special cases.

884
01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:15.480
David Schaich (he): So that is one form of the second law of thermodynamics which we've been able to derive essentially just from energy conservation. In the micro canonical on software

885
01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:23.630
David Schaich (he): there are more general formulations of this which are not going to be useful to derive. But we

886
01:28:24.010 --> 01:28:27.960
David Schaich (he): may as well state, because they're probably more familiar to you. If you.

887
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:33.620
David Schaich (he): I encountered the second law of dynamics as an idea in the past, your

888
01:28:36.190 --> 01:28:39.100
David Schaich (he): more general statements that

889
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:41.590
David Schaich (he): the entropy

890
01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.520
David Schaich (he): never decreases

891
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:50.120
David Schaich (he): as time passes

892
01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:56.590
David Schaich (he): and generically

893
01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:00.560
David Schaich (he): increases.

894
01:29:02.590 --> 01:29:03.730
David Schaich (he): Which is

895
01:29:06.850 --> 01:29:08.540
David Schaich (he): that the

896
01:29:09.490 --> 01:29:13.990
David Schaich (he): what we're doing today? Back to sort of that big picture we started off with

897
01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:17.150
David Schaich (he): on the very first day of term.

898
01:29:17.170 --> 01:29:19.620
David Schaich (he): and we talked about the arrow of time.

899
01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:26.150
David Schaich (he): an example of dye spreading out into a beak of water.

900
01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:37.340
David Schaich (he): where we know that this process only proceeds in one direction, even though the interactions between the molecules and the dye and the water that lead to that diffusion

901
01:29:37.770 --> 01:29:43.480
David Schaich (he): are reversible, and can just as well proceed the same forward, backward.

902
01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:47.590
David Schaich (he): the you arrow of time.

903
01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:52.690
David Schaich (he): We can now recognize as something connected to the entropy.

904
01:29:52.730 --> 01:30:02.390
David Schaich (he): something that never decreases as time passes and generally increases. So, as we go forward, we analyze more and more systems in more and more detail.

905
01:30:02.450 --> 01:30:05.580
David Schaich (he): You will see things like diffusion lead to

906
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:08.210
David Schaich (he): increases in the entropy

907
01:30:08.450 --> 01:30:11.680
compared to having the dial in the water separate.

908
01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:17.350
David Schaich (he): and the second wall. Then is the statements again an empirical

909
01:30:17.410 --> 01:30:21.550
David Schaich (he): observation, given a grand Us. Name like conservation of energy.

910
01:30:23.370 --> 01:30:27.540
David Schaich (he): and the statement that entropy increases that it's related to

911
01:30:29.710 --> 01:30:34.780
David Schaich (he): our observation of irreversible processes in practice.

912
01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:43.660
David Schaich (he): So that is a just a call back to some of the big picture

913
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:44.590
David Schaich (he): of

914
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:49.660
David Schaich (he): statistical physics that we are now making some progress digging into

915
01:30:50.050 --> 01:30:51.060
David Schaich (he): and

916
01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:54.290
David Schaich (he): before moving on to.

917
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:55.950
David Schaich (he): Let's see.

918
01:30:57.210 --> 01:31:04.290
David Schaich (he): I think there is time to d0 0ne last thing with the entropy. and we probably don't get to

919
01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:07.190
David Schaich (he): micro canonical temperature day.

920
01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:09.050
David Schaich (he): But

921
01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:19.570
David Schaich (he): the work that we've done so far looking at the second law of thermodynamics

922
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:24.260
David Schaich (he): actually gives us

923
01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:32.640
David Schaich (he): a more general definition of thermodynamic equilibrium.

924
01:31:52.570 --> 01:31:53.400
David Schaich (he): So

925
01:31:55.150 --> 01:32:00.600
David Schaich (he): if the entropy never decreases as time passes, and generically increases.

926
01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:09.310
David Schaich (he): Then, in the stable, steady state of thermodynamic equilibrium. we can't expect

927
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:11.370
David Schaich (he): that the entropy

928
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:18.680
David Schaich (he): has increased as much as it possibly can. It doesn't have anywhere further to go. Given the

929
01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:23.700
David Schaich (he): statistical system and the microstates that it has under consideration.

930
01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:31.500
David Schaich (he): So for so the general definition is that

931
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:36.400
David Schaich (he): in system use in

932
01:32:37.570 --> 01:32:41.050
David Schaich (he): so dynamic equilibrium.

933
01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:46.760
David Schaich (he): If it's entropy.

934
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:50.180
David Schaich (he): it's maximum.

935
01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:58.190
David Schaich (he): And this is more general than the

936
01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:05.490
David Schaich (he): definition that we looked at in the first half of today

937
01:33:06.670 --> 01:33:13.170
David Schaich (he): which was related specific to the micro canonical, unsolved. and we'll leave it with statements about all of the

938
01:33:13.190 --> 01:33:21.410
David Schaich (he): probabilities of the microstate, so that also will be equal. This definition in terms of

939
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:23.170
David Schaich (he): a maximal entropy

940
01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:25.810
David Schaich (he): holes

941
01:33:27.570 --> 01:33:31.360
David Schaich (he): not only for my economic.

942
01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:36.360
David Schaich (he): but also

943
01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:41.210
David Schaich (he): other more general ensembles. Nothing will be

944
01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:47.660
David Schaich (he): going through in the coming weeks. and we can actually derive

945
01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:49.700
David Schaich (he): hour

946
01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:53.260
over your definition

947
01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:55.220
David Schaich (he): in the micro canonical.

948
01:33:57.650 --> 01:33:58.930
David Schaich (he): I'm: Sorry. What?

949
01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:05.310
David Schaich (he): From this more general definition?

950
01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:12.500
David Schaich (he): And I think.

951
01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:14.990
David Schaich (he): yeah.

952
01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:18.290
David Schaich (he): 5 min. That's enough to to do this

953
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:22.850
David Schaich (he): unless there are questions about

954
01:34:23.150 --> 01:34:26.760
David Schaich (he): entropy or the second law, which I neglected to to pause

955
01:34:26.970 --> 01:34:28.220
David Schaich (he): and ask for

956
01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:37.840
David Schaich (he): It' be right. We can get the the calculation started.

957
01:34:40.130 --> 01:34:42.250
David Schaich (he): What we want to do

958
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:44.170
David Schaich (he): is so

959
01:34:46.730 --> 01:34:51.160
David Schaich (he): to consider a system in a thermodynamic equilibrium.

960
01:34:52.770 --> 01:34:53.920
David Schaich (he): You need to

961
01:34:56.020 --> 01:35:05.800
David Schaich (he): maximize the entropy. Yes. is that so of the P. I.

962
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:25.170
David Schaich (he): Well requiring that you satisfy the conditions of the micro canonical ensemble. that the energy and particle number are conserved.

963
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:30.140
David Schaich (he): and the probabilities themselves.

964
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:43.700
David Schaich (he): our will behave and add up to a 100%. It turns out that this condition is the only relevant one. and it can be incorporated into the maximization.

965
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:47.160
David Schaich (he): using a the garage multiplier.

966
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:50.490
David Schaich (he): which

967
01:35:56.340 --> 01:36:02.700
David Schaich (he): I'm: sure it's something you see. Possibly not for some time. Is it a term that you recognize?

968
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:05.570
David Schaich (he): Yeah, you're not out there.

969
01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:11.590
David Schaich (he): So, as a reminder what we do with the approach of the Rob's multipliers is

970
01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:13.650
David Schaich (he): to find a generalized

971
01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:19.110
David Schaich (he): interview. Function S: that depends on some parameter lambda, or multiplier.

972
01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:23.290
David Schaich (he): which is given by the entropy. We are interested in

973
01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:40.090
David Schaich (he): lambda times. the constraint that we want to be imposed that passes minus some rep, I. Log, P. I.

974
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:43.810
David Schaich (he): And then the constraint is that the

975
01:36:44.290 --> 01:36:47.980
David Schaich (he): some of the pi's minus one goes t0 0.

976
01:36:51.570 --> 01:36:52.720
David Schaich (he): So

977
01:36:54.830 --> 01:37:03.230
David Schaich (he): the idea is. if we first maximize this s bar of Lambda.

978
01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:07.310
David Schaich (he): and then impose

979
01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:21.260
David Schaich (he): our constraints. That sum over, I and I equals one. All the dependence on Lambda drops off. In other words. S. Mar becomes independent of Lambda.

980
01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:31.220
David Schaich (he): Say this derivative with respect to the and

981
01:37:33.260 --> 01:37:34.260
David Schaich (he): any

982
01:37:36.210 --> 01:37:44.460
David Schaich (he): maximum that we find in as far from this maximization. Procedure. therefore, corresponds

983
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:52.680
David Schaich (he): to a maximum of the S. That we are interested in.

984
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:54.550
which is what we get

985
01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:05.370
David Schaich (he): when, as far takes that particular value of Lambda equals 0, since we're now independent of land over the constraints and pose

986
01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:10.300
David Schaich (he): doesn't matter what value that we have dialed t0 0. Get back to us.

987
01:38:11.150 --> 01:38:12.020
David Schaich (he): So

988
01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:16.890
David Schaich (he): I haven't yet said actually what we are maximizing

989
01:38:17.290 --> 01:38:19.980
s far with respect to.

990
01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:26.400
David Schaich (he): and hopefully it makes sense that we maximize it with respect to

991
01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:30.500
David Schaich (he): the probabilities for any given micro state.

992
01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:36.850
David Schaich (he): since that is what is defining the probability space of this micro canonical.

993
01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:40.370
David Schaich (he): On some, also the maximum corresponds to

994
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:44.280
David Schaich (he): the derivative of being set t0 0, and

995
01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:51.110
David Schaich (he): putting in the expression for S bar that we have up above

996
01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:57.480
David Schaich (he): over IP I, and then the

997
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:02.970
David Schaich (he): the branch multiplier term.

998
01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:06.390
David Schaich (he): So

999
01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:13.370
David Schaich (he): each of the probabilities for each degree of freedom. I or K

1000
01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:19.310
David Schaich (he): is an independent variable. That was your starting point for

1001
01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:25.190
David Schaich (he): probability of spaces and statistical samples. so we can only take some derivative of

1002
01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:29.880
David Schaich (he): I, with respect to Pk. Is a chronic or delta

1003
01:39:30.050 --> 01:39:32.090
that just becomes one

1004
01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:38.590
David Schaich (he): when I equals K. Otherwise they're independence. They don't depend on each other. So the derivative vanishes.

1005
01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:39.960
David Schaich (he): So

1006
01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:48.060
David Schaich (he): something, then over, I I k. It just turns the

1007
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:56.210
David Schaich (he): remaining indices, I into case. So from that first term derivative of P. I. With respect to Pk.

1008
01:39:56.510 --> 01:40:02.530
David Schaich (he): We have an overall negative sign in one. No. Pk.

1009
01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:06.580
David Schaich (he): Going through with the product rule.

1010
01:40:07.170 --> 01:40:10.390
David Schaich (he): We have a P. K.

1011
01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:13.980
And then with the chain rule the derivative of the

1012
01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:22.210
David Schaich (he): It's one over Pk. and then the final term. Again, it's just the phone and

1013
01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:27.310
David Schaich (he): that some just picks out. I equals K. With that factor of Lambda.

1014
01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.130
Yeah.

1015
01:40:35.850 --> 01:40:37.200
David Schaich (he): I think I can

1016
01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:43.280
David Schaich (he): 20 a couple of minutes over, so I just put it down on TV

1017
01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:49.060
David Schaich (he): bottom of the page. Here. These 3 terms add up t0 0, so we can rearrange them that

1018
01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:58.500
David Schaich (he): the law, the Pk. it's lambda, minus one for Pk is e to the power and to minus one.

1019
01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:02.970
David Schaich (he): which is a constant it doesn't depend on.

1020
01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:14.610
David Schaich (he): hey? Does it depend on which microstate we are in. and because it's constant. you know, the only constant it can be is one over M. So that our

1021
01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:28.020
David Schaich (he): constraints with the sum over all I times one over M. As up t0 0ne which gives us back t0 0ur earlier definition of thermodynamic equilibrium specifically

1022
01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:32.570
David Schaich (he): for the micro canonical ensemble, so we have derived that earlier definition

1023
01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:38.600
David Schaich (he): from a more general one in terms of the maximization of the entropy.

1024
01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:45.030
David Schaich (he): So sorry for going slightly over. This is a nice results to

1025
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:49.630
David Schaich (he): end up with one last call for questions for today.

1026
01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:56.560
David Schaich (he): I don't see you tomorrow afternoon or the middle Computer Lab.

1027
01:41:56.770 --> 01:41:58.460
David Schaich (he): The pathway point to

1028
01:42:07.530 --> 01:42:08.790
David Schaich (he): so.
