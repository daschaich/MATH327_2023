1
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.460
David Schaich (he): Okay, we should be recording

2
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.380
David Schaich (he): one of the promised supplements

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:23.180
David Schaich (he): which in part are going to make up for losing four hours of lectures to bank holidays this May.  Looking in this first

4
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.600
David Schaich (he): supplemental pencast at a fairly brief derivation of the properties, of relativistic ideal fermion gases,

5
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.200
David Schaich (he): and recording this on one of those bank holidays,

6
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.060
David Schaich (he): the eighth of May.  Where

7
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.440
David Schaich (he): the context for looking at relativistic ideal fermion gases, and the reason we can be

8
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.390
David Schaich (he): pretty brief in our treatment of it, is that we have already seen

9
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.000
David Schaich (he): both pieces of the system in different contexts.

10
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.770
David Schaich (he): We have looked at

11
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.450
David Schaich (he): ultra-relativistic systems of bosons, and

12
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.920
David Schaich (he): in particular the certain type of bosons known as photons,

13
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.510
David Schaich (he): particles of light that are massless and ultra-relativistic

14
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:34.270
David Schaich (he): in that sense. and we can also look at the no temperature good.

15
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.710
David Schaich (he): And

16
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:46.160
David Schaich (he): it is an interesting question what happens when we slop around these properties we can look at non-relativistic bosomes for ultra-relativistic fermions.

17
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:58.030
David Schaich (he): The reason we you know consider here just the one. And what the other is that nominal mystic bosons get into some complicated phenomena known as Bose-einstein Compensation.

18
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.270
David Schaich (he): Hey, you very interesting and quantum mechanical effect

19
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.890
David Schaich (he): also awarded with a Nobel prize fairly recently. But I think being able to go to this module

20
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.550
David Schaich (he): in the context of

21
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.110
David Schaich (he): there's an interesting question you can ask

22
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:26.040
David Schaich (he): which of these 2 properties is the most important

23
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.440
David Schaich (he): behave like we have seen, or

24
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.690
David Schaich (he): this is a contrast between them. Statistics versus for a direct statistics really.

25
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.830
David Schaich (he): and give us more similarity between

26
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.600
the 2 different forcount gases independent of

27
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.940
David Schaich (he): of their energies.

28
00:02:50.670 --> 00:03:02.640
David Schaich (he): Another. The reason to consider the system of there are such things playing an important role in nature.

29
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.000
David Schaich (he): So

30
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.350
David Schaich (he): an example of

31
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.400
David Schaich (he): between those that's like

32
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:25.080
David Schaich (he): I mean you can make microwave back on the phone all of space with Actually.

33
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.540
David Schaich (he): we're in, showed

34
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.560
the's every second.

35
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:38.660
David Schaich (he): There's a large number of you, those out there. and they are very like particles. their masks in every day you. This is

36
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.170
minus 37 power

37
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.230
David Schaich (he): the we which is such a small

38
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.010
David Schaich (he): fraction of the kilogram that is more useful to you. Compare it to

39
00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:03.640
David Schaich (he): the massive electron. The otherwise latest elementary particle is not exactly Nationalist. and here there are there's a ratio without a fact, probability of it.

40
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.710
David Schaich (he): We need it.

41
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:15.680
David Schaich (he): The electron mass and the heaviest possible between elevators. Experiments have discovered that between those are not exactly massless. But

42
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:26.190
David Schaich (he): what the mass actually is remains that remains too small for in the existing technology to determine. If there are lots of experiments that are in your way to

43
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.900
David Schaich (he): measure for the first time how massive these between those actually are.

44
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.930
David Schaich (he): But that's a digression. What matters for our purposes is that this mass is so tiny there is.

45
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.990
David Schaich (he): It is, yeah, perfectly good

46
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:48.620
David Schaich (he): approximation to preview free those and also relativistic particles like photons. Yeah.

47
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.580
David Schaich (he): Neutral energy.

48
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.700
David Schaich (he): either by that week letter new in the subscript.

49
00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.610
David Schaich (he): even by the speed of light. which is also the speed of massless neutrinos.

50
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.750
David Schaich (he): good approximation to the actual speed of between those

51
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.530
David Schaich (he): multiplying by.

52
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.200
David Schaich (he): We'll make some of those between those

53
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.450
David Schaich (he): which, just as we did for photos, we could recast, as links called the Beach ball. I'm a steel

54
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.290
David Schaich (he): angular frequency of

55
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.850
David Schaich (he): the neutrino as a wave. Here these frequencies.

56
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.030
David Schaich (he): our conversely related to the wavelength of that way.

57
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.310
David Schaich (he): bye. the speed of light.

58
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.390
David Schaich (he): And if we regulate these systems in a finite volume, give us the usual.

59
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.550
David Schaich (he): the ratio of high over.

60
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.880
David Schaich (he): I'm. Staying in your product. The free vector of the

61
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.030
David Schaich (he): is a strictly positive integer. Again.

62
00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.380
David Schaich (he): exactly the same setup as for a photon gas.

63
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.340
David Schaich (he): If there are more similarities between

64
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.500
David Schaich (he): both of those particles, are.

65
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.990
David Schaich (he): it's we have to create and absorb.

66
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.230
David Schaich (he): So we go pieces. You analyze the

67
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.730
David Schaich (he): using. The

68
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.850
David Schaich (he): chemical potential u equals 0.

69
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.460
David Schaich (he): You're not remembering that the chemical potential one of the definitions is the

70
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:46.410
David Schaich (he): amount of energy that results from changing the part of the number, reading or absorbing between those

71
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.690
David Schaich (he): as they're able to impact on the energy of the system.

72
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.640
David Schaich (he): which is what it means for the chemical potential to be vanishing.

73
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.330
David Schaich (he): If we. this follow the

74
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.400
David Schaich (he): steps that we went through for

75
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.700
David Schaich (he): the photon gas just starting from the very direct distribution.

76
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:15.950
David Schaich (he): like an economical partition function rather than the both science and the economical partition function.

77
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:27.090
David Schaich (he): I'll remind you, and you can look up in your notes that those 2 options differ only by certain negative signs. so we can follow exactly the same steps as the proton gas.

78
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.920
David Schaich (he): I'm, arguing that it be a reasonably largely

79
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.220
we have the wavelength we have approximately continuous.

80
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.980
David Schaich (he): and the treat you treat a moment that we can integrate over and

81
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.200
David Schaich (he): converting that to critical coordinates

82
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:57.340
David Schaich (he): and accounting for what other difference is that between those like electrons have you spin states? Is a degenerate

83
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.540
David Schaich (he): energy levels with the same energy for every

84
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:10.650
David Schaich (he): combination, all of integer momentum number. rather than the 2 polarizations of

85
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.740
David Schaich (he): those 2 are the same.

86
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.970
David Schaich (he): The different signs are one.

87
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:22.710
David Schaich (he): It comes out front of the Grand Canonical potential. or for me, on

88
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.410
David Schaich (he): maybe the temperature

89
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.150
function.

90
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.010
David Schaich (he): and there

91
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:38.750
David Schaich (he): integrated over the positive frequency of the neutrinos

92
00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:44.850
David Schaich (he): an exponential factor.

93
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.860
David Schaich (he): Yes.

94
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.640
David Schaich (he): the log of one plus the exponential.

95
00:08:51.100 --> 00:09:01.760
David Schaich (he): The energy divided by it's not for sure. The different signs that we have here compared to the photon dance are that relative sign

96
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:07.180
David Schaich (he): inside the algorithm and the that's how Pros.

97
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.050
David Schaich (he): So

98
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:20.440
David Schaich (he): office basis. We can't continue deriving all of the usual properties on the gases that we might be interested in. So the

99
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.240
David Schaich (he): first step can be

100
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.030
David Schaich (he): the average particle number and

101
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.120
David Schaich (he): expectation. Now for the number of

102
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.130
how many calls

103
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:48.630
David Schaich (he): what I do is the the potential with respect to the chemical potential. only setting the chemical potential to 0. After doing all of the mathematical manipulations that we need

104
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.320
David Schaich (he): compute this negative signs. Yes, it helps

105
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.650
David Schaich (he): and then

106
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:08.840
David Schaich (he): restore the chemical potential that we have set to 0. You can see from all your work that shows up inside

107
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.570
David Schaich (he): E to the view over temperature.

108
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.650
David Schaich (he): which

109
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.350
David Schaich (he): hopefully a

110
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.090
David Schaich (he): familiar derivative to be doing

111
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:44.370
David Schaich (he): denominator. I'll go ahead and set new to 0 now, so the E to the 0 factor is just a one. I'll make a square

112
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:52.050
David Schaich (he): setting you to 0. And then the argument to the exponential.

113
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.110
David Schaich (he): maybe that comes down

114
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.140
David Schaich (he): temperature of whatever they want. How cool.

115
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:14.690
David Schaich (he): so do the usual manipulation of this, like we did for motown gases to file through at the exponential factor of change variables to

116
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.590
David Schaich (he): X is Beta H bar. They go

117
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.770
David Schaich (he): for the temperature.

118
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:27.250
David Schaich (he): So the 2 powers of Omega and the third d Omega will give us

119
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.400
David Schaich (he): 3 powers of temperature over

120
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.620
David Schaich (he): the integral.

121
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:41.390
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

122
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.390
David Schaich (he): my is 0 or infinity. So is X, and it

123
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.220
David Schaich (he): X squared over E. Px.

124
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.020
David Schaich (he): Yes.

125
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.560
David Schaich (he): this is another one of those

126
00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:05.150
David Schaich (he): very elegant integrals that you are just going to look out for the purposes of this module

127
00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:14.170
David Schaich (he): we encountered almost the same one.

128
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:26.030
David Schaich (he): What that positive sign that brings in here Is it overall factor. the one minus 2 squared so 3 quarters and then the same

129
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:32.970
David Schaich (he): gamma function to 3 and reload Zeta function are going to take 3.

130
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:40.470
David Schaich (he): So just 3 quarters. I'm. Steve. the role that appears to the

131
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.780
David Schaich (he): so 3

132
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.340
David Schaich (he): you go ahead.

133
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.230
David Schaich (he): The average

134
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:53.660
David Schaich (he): is.

135
00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:04.000
David Schaich (he): we all say, the function of 3. So 3 quarters on scale of 3 is 2 factorial gives us 3 halves.

136
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.690
They

137
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.520
David Schaich (he): foundation, or always

138
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:22.530
David Schaich (he): the functional form is the volume. Times temperature queue

139
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.990
David Schaich (he): same functional form that we had for your phone. Yes.

140
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:36.880
David Schaich (he): so so far, at least, the preliminary answer to our question is that the ultra-relativistic energy seems to be having more of an effect there.

141
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:46.500
David Schaich (he): The very direct statistics. We have a fine name results that look very much like we go, Tom gas, just with slightly different

142
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.660
David Schaich (he): numerical factors out from the different signs

143
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:51.470
David Schaich (he): in the

144
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.380
for an economic competition function.

145
00:13:55.250 --> 00:14:03.070
David Schaich (he): We will keep going, aiming ultimately at the equation of State that we used to get their information out.

146
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:08.790
David Schaich (he): All of the macroscopic properties of this between the gas or

147
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:15.340
David Schaich (he): relativistic ideal for me, I guess, is more generally so that involves the

148
00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.170
David Schaich (he): for sure and

149
00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.160
David Schaich (he): well, to get the pressure, we need the internal energy

150
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.690
David Schaich (he): as well.

151
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.730
David Schaich (he): and through the derivation of

152
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:38.650
David Schaich (he): the equation of state, we will have that pressure and related to

153
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.210
David Schaich (he): average particle number and temperature.

154
00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.500
David Schaich (he): So the next piece to look at is the internal energy.

155
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.840
David Schaich (he): And for this just like the

156
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:58.310
David Schaich (he): relativistic

157
00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.200
David Schaich (he): already gone through.

158
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.050
David Schaich (he): You have seen it

159
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:12.950
David Schaich (he): that within the integral over frequencies we just need to add an extra factor

160
00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.370
David Schaich (he): of the energy.

161
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.300
David Schaich (he): Okay.

162
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.530
David Schaich (he): So

163
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:28.590
David Schaich (he): which we're going to switch to. Here is

164
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.080
an X on this temperature.

165
00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.440
David Schaich (he): So we can.

166
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.220
David Schaich (he): rather than doing a derivative with respect to Beta.

167
00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:49.380
David Schaich (he): another way to get the average internal energy in Canada make use of some of our calculations

168
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.300
to start

169
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:59.180
David Schaich (he): the average internal. even just by

170
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.820
David Schaich (he): Yeah, yeah, the

171
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.800
David Schaich (he): I was t you have to be 3 plus one

172
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.480
David Schaich (he): is for

173
00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.020
David Schaich (he): from high school

174
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.160
David Schaich (he): integrated now over

175
00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.290
David Schaich (he): x squared plus one is guess, queued

176
00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.260
David Schaich (he): the same denominator to the X plus one.

177
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:33.730
David Schaich (he): with the additional power of X in the numerator. Here you get in, have.

178
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.690
David Schaich (he): and we want data functions

179
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:48.770
David Schaich (he): is one minus one over 2 cubed rather than one minus one over 2 squared.

180
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:56.190
David Schaich (he): The 7 eighths times is 6 times 7, 8 is

181
00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.330
David Schaich (he): 7 times 3 quarters.

182
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:11.470
David Schaich (he): And remember that 3 Mall data function of 4 is a nice converted series

183
00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.940
David Schaich (he): to pi it to the fourth power over 90. The next thing

184
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.190
I squared

185
00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.640
David Schaich (he): each part of you see

186
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.290
to the fourth.

187
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.910
David Schaich (he): which, if we

188
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.950
David Schaich (he): compare this to the average number density.

189
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:45.980
David Schaich (he): As for yes. you see that the internal energy is just proportional. 2, the average particle number of times, some additional

190
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.010
David Schaich (he): of the energy. And if we

191
00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.980
David Schaich (he): to determine this explicit.

192
00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.980
David Schaich (he): all I need to do is convert from

193
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:11.750
David Schaich (he): 3 headers times in the cube. This factor, with ties, h parts and C is in the parentheses is the same, so that will cancel out so inviting

194
00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.590
David Schaich (he): 3 0 3

195
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.800
David Schaich (he): in 2,

196
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.220
this place

197
00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.610
David Schaich (he): 7 times, 3 quarters times

198
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.540
David Schaich (he): those cancellations of the 3, and then

199
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:41.650
David Schaich (he): one of those 2 is, we could take 7 5 4, and 2 times 90 is 1, 88, it's a to 3,

200
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:53.090
David Schaich (he): or we could ultimately express this in terms of the ratio. the functions

201
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.010
David Schaich (he): before over 0 3.

202
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.150
David Schaich (he): So, so far are you?

203
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:18.080
David Schaich (he): Similarly, with the photon gas is still bearing out. This ratio of

204
00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:26.890
David Schaich (he): data functions is something we've seen before, and the different signs coming from the periodic. All the statistics compared to both of

205
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.240
David Schaich (he): you. Just get a overall back to your room

206
00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:38.720
David Schaich (he): increases the energy compared to the case for the proton gas.

207
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:40.580
David Schaich (he): So

208
00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:56.140
David Schaich (he): to take the next step toward the equation of States. we need the pressure of the neutral gas. which is a derivative they they can add cost of entry. So we need the interview

209
00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:57.920
David Schaich (he): for the phone call. Yes.

210
00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.260
David Schaich (he): or

211
00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:11.880
David Schaich (he): really all the the here is to figure out the condition of

212
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:23.030
David Schaich (he): that should be certainly something. Yes. can it be computed? We have computer that?

213
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:32.580
David Schaich (he): Yeah, we

214
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.710
David Schaich (he): okay

215
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:43.530
David Schaich (he): for anthropical potential, the land that our free energy that comes into the relation between energy and intervene that we've derived.

216
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.030
David Schaich (he): We read this here same

217
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.640
David Schaich (he): overall pre-factor we've already seen, but I will now

218
00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:03.750
David Schaich (he): do the same change of variables to X

219
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:15.260
David Schaich (he): in the economical potential you can pick up. We'll make it great. Do you want me now? 3 factors.

220
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.180
David Schaich (he): my temperature over H far

221
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.020
David Schaich (he): the integral of X squared.

222
00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:27.160
David Schaich (he): Yes.

223
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.920
David Schaich (he): and this is an integral, that. Okay, we won't

224
00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:42.250
David Schaich (he): How to solve manually in this module, where we can recognize that up to assign is the same as all the encounters with the hotel gas.

225
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.180
David Schaich (he): We'd expect it to be just same number. meaning that

226
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:57.410
David Schaich (he): the overall functional form of the grant, and all the potential is proportional to the point in times 4 h of team. just like the internal energy.

227
00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.900
David Schaich (he): so that the interview itself, proportional to

228
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:05.890
David Schaich (he): Vt. Cubed.

229
00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.660
David Schaich (he): I don't want to see you

230
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:20.320
David Schaich (he): is that It's something to be if we rearrange that

231
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:28.090
David Schaich (he): you do it. This relation between temperature and volume.

232
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.030
David Schaich (he): and that

233
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.170
David Schaich (he): yeah.

234
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.500
David Schaich (he): the specific number at this integral

235
00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:46.990
David Schaich (he): and all the ways to is another factor of 7

236
00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.030
like 4

237
00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.320
David Schaich (he): over it. 490 is 360.

238
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:11.370
David Schaich (he): So that gives us the entropy just for that combination, if you want it for now we will keep our focus on the equation of state.

239
00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:13.570
David Schaich (he): Yeah.

240
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.750
yes.

241
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:15.680
David Schaich (he): that we need

242
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:16.560
to

243
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.230
the

244
00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.270
David Schaich (he): minus the derivative of the perspective, one

245
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.340
internal energy. fixed entropy.

246
00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.620
David Schaich (he): So this is the negative sign.

247
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.350
David Schaich (he): The

248
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:42.890
David Schaich (he): 7 high, squared over 4 times 3 is 1 20.

249
00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:58.210
David Schaich (he): The derivative with respect to volume of Vt. To the fourth, which is E to the 4,

250
00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:03.180
David Schaich (he): What is the Times V to the minus 4.

251
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:05.140
David Schaich (he): So 3 of those 4.

252
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.060
David Schaich (he): These the lines went through together.

253
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:19.630
David Schaich (he): and that is, implementing our condition. So entropy defining the pressure. and when we take the derivative

254
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:29.850
David Schaich (he): i'll be to the minus one for it, because one over 3D negative signs canceling it's

255
00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.030
right.

256
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.960
David Schaich (he): including the to the 4,

257
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:46.400
David Schaich (he): and I have already pulled out the extra power of one over V. That we get from the derivatives B to the minus one here in his left.

258
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.920
We can't recognize as

259
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:51.220
David Schaich (he): the internal energy.

260
00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.360
of course.

261
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.080
David Schaich (he): into this. Derivative In the first place.

262
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:08.480
David Schaich (he): this is the same as the hotel gas. all of the different

263
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.980
David Schaich (he): into the energy to the

264
00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:17.700
David Schaich (he): we, the state that we have when I do, I guess the

265
00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:27.280
David Schaich (he): it's the for of the Pressure Times volume being equal to 1 30.

266
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:36.760
David Schaich (he): The average in terms of energy which you related to the average particle number times the temperature

267
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:42.480
David Schaich (he): 7 over 3, P. To the 6. That's the ratio.

268
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.310
David Schaich (he): Those data functions.

269
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:55.060
David Schaich (he): If we plug in those data functions

270
00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.710
David Schaich (he): the public 40

271
00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.210
David Schaich (he): data, 3

272
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.810
David Schaich (he): and

273
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.720
David Schaich (he): absolutely so.

274
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.010
David Schaich (he): It does not change too much as

275
00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:22.050
David Schaich (he): it's. argument increases from 3 to 4. That is the factors that we have in the

276
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:28.760
David Schaich (he): and point 9 times 7 over 6 overall factor, just about one

277
00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:38.260
David Schaich (he): just below it. we find that. compared to the ideal gas law, we are just yeah, 5%

278
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:42.830
David Schaich (he): larger pressure with everything else the same.

279
00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:47.510
David Schaich (he): Once we do a fires times it. And

280
00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:53.830
David Schaich (he): but we now go through this full derivation, and our inclusion in terms of how this.

281
00:26:53.990 --> 00:27:01.630
David Schaich (he): the ultimate. the large scale properties that we get out of a statistical physics analysis

282
00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:14.730
David Schaich (he): very similar to the total gas. the only differences being

283
00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:21.780
David Schaich (he): slightly different numerical factors. And in the case of the equation of state.

284
00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.890
The different factor is

285
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.670
David Schaich (he): just an extra

286
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:34.880
David Schaich (he): 7 over 6 compared to the and

287
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:43.050
David Schaich (he): the physical. A story about why this turns out to be the case. it's just that

288
00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:50.000
David Schaich (he): you. the large volume that we have assumed in order to integrate over

289
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.770
David Schaich (he): for me a momentum represented by the far beyond frequency as they wave

290
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:08.900
David Schaich (he): that allows for there to be very many energy levels very close to space in particular, a lot of them compared to the number of particles.

291
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.260
David Schaich (he): So that's there is relatively little effect from the poly exclusion principle that says

292
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:22.270
David Schaich (he): that 2 programs cannot occupy the same energy level. There are so many energy levels to choose from tabs

293
00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.650
David Schaich (he): the sorts of

294
00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:29.050
David Schaich (he): collisions. The multiple occupancy is being forbidden by the

295
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.260
David Schaich (he): rare.

296
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:32.500
David Schaich (he): and their effect is small.

297
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.030
David Schaich (he): just changing it.

298
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.130
David Schaich (he): Factors like 4.9.

299
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.920
David Schaich (he): That's a physical choice of hell to

300
00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.760
David Schaich (he): better remember. It makes sense of

301
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.060
David Schaich (he): the full mathematical derivation that we've now called through.
